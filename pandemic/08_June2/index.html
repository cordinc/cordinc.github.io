<h4 id="late-june-played-20160501">Late June (played 2016/05/01)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Jimi Harkonnen (Operations Expert) - Ivan</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Charles</li>
  <li>Dominique (Quarantine Specialist) - Ann</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Kai</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (3 out of 4 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Quarantine 7 Faded cities</li>
  <li>Eradicate at least 1 disease</li>
  <li>Have a military base in each of the 6 world regions</li>
</ul>

<p>Chastened from their earlier defeat, the team reassembles for a second
chance to save the world in June with a repeat of the plan from earlier,
but with a renewed sense of teamwork. Starting in Istanbul to deal with
initial infections in Europe, Khartoum &amp; Chennai the team is rocked by
an epidemic at the earliest opportunity. Baghdad gains a large
infection. The team brushes this off to start laying quarantines across
the Middle East and building a military base in Paris. Some research is
shared, but unfortunately knowledge of cures is spread evenly among the
team.</p>

<p>However, soon the team has larger problems. <em>Accelerated Infection</em>
strips Chennai’s quarantine and it is then immediately infected causing
an outbreak. Similarly, a potential infection event ends Baghdad’s
quarantine and it immediately outbreaks due to <em>Accelerated Infection</em>.
To help reimpose the quarantines, Akira moves Dominique to Karachi, with
the declaration “it is completely safe, for it to be a problem there
would need to be an infection and Karachi would have to be the infected
city”. An epidemic them immediately occurs with Karachi being the
infected city - whoops. Dominique is now <em>Paranoid</em> as her friend
betrayed her. Chennai and Paris have outbreaks as a result of the
epidemic.</p>

<p>The Faded infection is now extremely bad, the worst the team has ever
seen. All faded cities have some infected, and many are on the verge of
outbreaks <em>[3 cubes]</em>. The team soldiers on. Reimposing quarantines
and sharing enough knowledge for Curie to cure Radalia-X and a Na-Jib
cure rapidly approaching. With military bases built in LA &amp; Bogota the
world is half saved at the half way point. Realising this cheers the
team slightly from the sense of impending doom from out of control Faded
infections.</p>

<p>An outbreak in Algiers collapses the city and spreads the Fade infection
to Europe and Africa. Soon after an epidemic in Kolkata causes cascading
outbreaks in Delhi &amp; Chennai and brings the fade infection into Asia.
The team is recalled again about half way into the allotted time, as the
outbreaks have reached an unacceptable level. Although the recall
prevents team members Curie &amp; Jimi from becoming psychologically
scarred.</p>

<p>The speed of the Fade infection and the inability of the team to do much
about it brings the military faction of the CDC to supremacy. It is
decided that permanent military bases will be built in Bogota and Paris.
Chennai, Cairo &amp; Baghdad are rioting. Algiers is collapsing. Except for
Istanbul <em>[how long can it hold out?]</em>, all CoDA cities are now faded
and the infection has spread to Paris, Madrid, Khartoum, Bangkok &amp; Hong
Kong.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Loss <em>[too many outbreaks]</em></p>
