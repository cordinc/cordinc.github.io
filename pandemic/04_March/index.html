<h4 id="march-played-20160221">March (played 2016/02/21)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Gwyneth Paltrow Head (Medic) - Ivan</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Ann</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Charles</li>
  <li>Dominique (Quarantine Specialist) - Kai</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (2 out of 3 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Eradicate at least 1 disease</li>
  <li>Have a military base in each of the 6 world regions</li>
</ul>

<p>The same CDC team that saved the world in February reforms for an
attempted repeat performance in March. With the team now able to order
the construction of military bases there is some discussion as to what
this means. Most team members are broadly suspicious of the military,
while Dominique is gung-ho. So it is decided the team will attempt to
meet the extra objectives by eradicating a disease. The initial reports
suggest acute Radalia-X infections in North America and low, but widely
spread CoDa levels in the Middle East. The team decides to start in
Atlanta again.</p>

<p>The game starts with the North American infections quickly cleared and
Dominique laying quarantines across the Middle East where CoDa slowly
builds up. Some lucky research and rivalry between Curie &amp; Head lead to
a quick cure of Na-Jib. Nerves are frayed somewhat by an epidemic in
Tehran. Fearing the worst, <em>One Quiet Night</em> is immediately used to give
Akira time to rush across the world and drop a quarantine on Tehran, and
just in time as the quarantine is immediately tested. More lucky
research sees Radalia &amp; Terrancella cures come in quick succession a few
days <em>[circuits of the players]</em> later. The limits of quarantine are
being tested in the Middle East <em>[all the quarantine markers are on the
board]</em>, so Akira rushes Marie Curie across North America to eradicate
Na-jib The world is saved in near record time, with no outbreaks and
also no military bases constructed.</p>

<p>At the end of the month a <em>Common Structure</em> for Na-jib is discovered
and Akira gains <em>Local Pressure</em> to help with future quarantines.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Win <em>[cure + eradicate]</em></p>
