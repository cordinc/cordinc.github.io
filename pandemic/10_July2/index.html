<h4 id="late-july-played-20160515">Late July (played 2016/05/15)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Clarissa Pink (Colonel) - Ann</li>
  <li>GI Jeaux (Soldier) - Ivan</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Charles</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Fung</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (3 out of 5 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Quarantine 7 Faded cities</li>
  <li>Eradicate at least 1 disease</li>
  <li>Have a military base in each of the 6 world regions</li>
  <li>Find the Virologist</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no changes to the CDC team roster in late July, but despite
three straight losses to the forces of disease and panic, the team is in
high spirits. Funding levels have increased (plus the promise of greatly
higher funding if there is a fourth consecutive loss <em>[Box 8]</em>).
Furthermore, the team is confident that the new talents of Akira &amp; Pink
will results in a greater ability to combat Faded and other infections
in a timely matter. The team resolves to use the same plan as last time,
but deal with dangerous situations as early as possible, rather than
reacting to escalations.</p>

<p>The team starts in Istanbul and heads out to treat the initial
infections. An epidemic hits Khartoum, but with no further bad effects.
GI Jeaux starts planning a search for the Virologist as he can’t
contemplate leaving someone behind infected lines. There is some
discussion, but the rest of the team want to continue with the original
plan. The soldier follows his orders, laying waste to Faded cities with
what seems like an endless supply of <em>Grenade Launchers</em>. <em>Colonel</em> Pink
similarly heads down through Africa and back up through the middle east
keeping CoDA under control to an extent not seen since the start of the
year.</p>

<p>An epidemic in Johannesbug is contained by <em>One Quiet Night</em> and later a
flying visit from Akira. Further problems are prevented in Johannesburg
by a <em>Resilient Population [saving Akira from scarring]</em>, <em>Local
Initiative</em> quarantines in London and Essen, and finally an <em>Airstrike</em>
on Paris. The extra funding is hugely beneficial! Despite an outbreak in
Miami, 3 epidemics have passed without much concern. Akira and Curie are
flying across the world treating disease as they go. The team is dealing
with infections as soon as they appear. Only the linked and heavily
infected cities of London and Essen are a cause for worry. Curie cures
Radalia-X and through blind luck, Akira accumulates enough research to
cure Terrancella.</p>

<p>As Pink and Jeaux continue to scythe their way through Faded cities
another epidemic hits, but a <em>Grassroots Program</em> again removes any
danger despite an outbreak in Taipei. The confident and slightly excited
team now begin to prepare for the end. A remote outpost sees a military
base constructed in the not particularly remote LA. Thus just a cure for
Na-jib, plus one other objective is required. Calculating the time
remaining, the team builds a plan with many contingencies.</p>

<p>As the end nears it becomes clear the team will not be able to lay
enough quarantines, and Na-jib research is not progressing well enough
for Curie to cure it in time. Another planning session ensues. More
lucky research by Akira means he is within reach of curing Na-jib, with
a bit of sharing. Jeaux charges to London to be in position for this
transfer. Curie uses her little Na-jib research to fly to North America
and clear up some minor infections there. The situation is tense. Akira
will be the last possible person to act <em>[cards run out]</em> and can cure
Na-jib and then clear London and Essen. This could result in eradication
and victory… if no further infections occur. The last epidemic hits.
There is a sigh when reports of infection in Paris arrive, until it is
remembered that is now a Faded city. There are no extra Na-jib
infections! Akira cures Na-jib and eradicates it at the last possible
moment. The world is saved again!</p>

<p>Back at base after the effort Na-jib becomes <em>Efficient to Sequence</em> and
has <em>Easier Agents</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Victory <em>[cure, eradicate and military bases]</em></p>
