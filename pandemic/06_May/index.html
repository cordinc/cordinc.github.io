<h4 id="may-played-20160306">May (played 2016/03/06)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Gwyneth Paltrow Head (Medic) - Fung</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Ann</li>
  <li>Clarissa Pink (Colonel) - Kai</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Charles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (3 out of 4 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Quarantine 7 Faded cities</li>
  <li>Eradicate at least 1 disease</li>
  <li>Have a military base in each of the 6 world regions</li>
</ul>

<p>As CDC funding drops ever lower <em>[only 2 funded actions cards]</em>, the
team’s confidence is somewhat rocked - how long can their luck last.
Especially considering the incredibly virulent and fast spreading Fade
virus. Spirits lift slightly with a new addition to the long-standing
team: <em>Colonel</em> Clarrisa Pink (a relative of Bobbie’s). At the start of
May disease is concentrated in the east, with Bangkok, Tapei &amp; Kolkata
at dangerous levels. Thus the team starts in the Istanbul station.</p>

<p>The initial plan is for Curie &amp; Head to research diseases, while Akira
and Pink lay down quarantines across the Middle East to slow the spread
of Fade. The plan starts well, Curie already has all the research
necessary to cure Radalia-X by the end of her first shift. Soon after
the quarantine barrier has been created. Maybe our luck would hold.</p>

<p>Just after Radalia-X is cured the first epidemic arrives and causes an
outbreak in Bangkok. However, the real worry is Kolkata - it is near the
limit for Fade infections and would soon worsen <em>[it was in the top 8
of the infection deck]</em>. A <em>One Quiet Night</em> gives us the time to deal
with it. In the end it didn’t matter as another epidemic occurs with an
outbreak in Jakarta. Terrancella infections look problematic, especially
Tokyo. Kolkata is temporarily ignored as Pink rushed to cure Tokyo (and
just in time), then Head flies across the world to quarantine Kolkata
and remotely cure Jakarta. Another epidemic hits Baghdad, but a
quarantine prevents disaster. Then Terrancella is cured at half way
through the month.</p>

<p>The team is conflicted. Akira is certain we are headed towards failure
as we still need to cure Na-Jib and have made no progress on other
objectives. Pink is confident she can order the construction of enough
military bases and quarantine barriers that victory is still within
reach. Head and Curie are unsure. Much discussion on strategy ensues.
The final decision is that the team will aim to eradicate Terrancella as
there quarters of the team are already in Asia. Then move to North
America to share knowledge on Na-Jib.</p>

<p>The plan is immediately tested as quarantines across the Middle East are
lifted with Pink rushing to reestablish the defensive line. Pink takes a
little longer than optimal to achieve this as she studiously and
successfully avoids the possibility of scarring (causing some to
question the quality of contemporary military bravery). Curie and Head
charge across Asia to cure Terancella, but the plan takes a delay as an
epidemic occurs centred on Beijing. Akira clears this up and the
eradication goal is achieved.</p>

<p>The team mostly starts to meet up in North America (apart from Pink),
when Akira makes a depressing discovery. It seems that time has run a
little shorter then expected. There is only a single shift for everyone
left, apart from Akira who has two. The team still needs to cure Na-Jib
and either build bases or double the current number of quarantines.
There is more discussion on how to get Curie the necessary research to
cure Na-Jib. It soon becomes clear this is just not possible.
Despondency ensues and talk shifts to how to minimise damage before
another attempt later in the month. Then salvation, as someone notices
it is possible to get enough research to Pink for her to cure Na-Jib if
all of Akira’s, Curie’s and the Colonel’s shifts are dedicated to this
task. Everyone is amazed that the <em>Colonel</em>, the worst team member for
research could achieve the goal. Although the team quickly refocuses on
determining if the last objective can be achieved. It is calculated that
Head &amp; Akira can establish enough quarantines to cover 7 Faded cities.
Although this assumes no quarantines are lifted before the end - and
there is still one epidemic left too. Will our luck hold for just one
more month?</p>

<p>Akira flies Pink to North America and starts sharing knowledge, as does
Curie. Pink continues to learn and then cures Na-Jib with her last
possible action. Then comes the epidemic. Most of it hits South America
(including a Lima outbreak), but worse it also lifts two quarantines in
Faded cities. The task is lost. But no, what is this! A <em>Local
Initiative</em>, long forgotten, is suddenly funded and two extra
quarantines are immediately established! It might just still be
possible. As Head and then Akira place the final quarantines, the last
infections fall in South America. Akira places the last quarantine
necessary for victory with the last possible action. Incredible! Watches
are checked as the tension released with a successful resolution
<em>[longest pandemic game I’ve played at 1hr 32 minutes from the first
action to the last, not including setup time. The last half hour was
incredibly tense]</em></p>

<p>Amazingly no one has yet been scarred, thanks to some deft and prescient
manoeuvres by Pink. Tehran &amp; Algiers are rioting. London, Cairo,
Baghdad, Khartoum, Lagos, Osaka, Bogota, Chicago, Washington, Bangkok,
Jakarta, Lima, Santiago &amp; Sydney are unstable <em>[how much longer can
this be contained]</em>. At the end Algiers gains a permanent military base
and Terrancella becomes <em>Efficient to Sequence</em>.</p>

<p>The team decides to stop there as dealing with this pandemic had
exhausted the already tired team.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Victory <em>[cure, eradicate &amp; quarantine]</em></p>
