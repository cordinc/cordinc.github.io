<h4 id="august-played-20160613">August (played 2016/06/13)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Clarissa Pink (Colonel) - Ann</li>
  <li>GI Jeaux (Soldier) - Fung</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Kai/Ivan</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Charles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (3 out of 5 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Quarantine 7 Faded cities</li>
  <li>Have a military base in each of the 6 world regions</li>
  <li>Find the Virologist</li>
  <li>Find the Immunologist</li>
</ul>

<p>An unchanged team reconvenes after a month to discover that eradication
is no longer an objective as the CoDA infection escalates. In addition
the team should now also search for a lost Immunologist. As a reward for
saving the world in July, the CDC is gifted a military base in the city
of their choosing. By selecting San Francisco, there is now a base in
each area of the world, thus completing one objective for the month
before even starting work! The team starts confident.</p>

<p>With many initial CoDA infections in the Middle East, the team elects to
begin at the Istanbul station. Akira starts laying quarantines across
the Middle East to protect against further infections, Jeaux &amp; Pink cure
Faded cities. Curie realises that she can trade in her useless CoDA
research together with <em>Binoculars</em> in the quarantined Istanbul to
conduct a thorough search for the Virologist - and she is discovered.
Disappointingly her information is to find the Virologist and that our
meds are placebos - what is up? Still, after one work period, the team
is just a single objective from finishing!</p>

<p>An epidemic in Mexico City refocuses the team towards curing, which
progresses steadily. Another epidemic in Beijing passes in <em>One Quiet
Night</em> as Pink flys across the world and back again to ensure Algiers is
safe from outbreak. Just in time as the city suffers infection
immediately afterwards. Soon after the world is looking relatively
healthy with all the diseases under control and no serious infection
<em>[no city has 3 cubes]</em>. The team takes the respite to plan how to
cure the diseases. It is decided that Curie will collect Radalia
research and Akira Na-Jib research. Jeaux &amp; Pink will continuing
treating disease unless called away to share research.</p>

<p>The Na-Jib cures come quickly from Akira, thanks to well planned
movement and research collaboration in North America. An epidemic occurs
in Kolkata and infection starts to rise across Asia and the Middle East.
The team decides to prioritise cures so Jeaux and Pink are spend more
time sharing research than treating. Curie working in South America
collects the required research for Radalia, but runs out of time to cure - it will have to wait for her next opportunity. Akira is close to
curing Terrancella, and a plan is determined that will see all
objectives met in a single rotation. Another epidemic challenges that
plan as outbreaks occur in Montreal, Ho Chi Minh and Kolkata. However,
soon it is decided the plan will stay unchanged. There are high levels
of untreated infection across the world and although a few cities may
need to be sacrificed, a cure will be found quickly - unless there is
another epidemic.</p>

<p>Jeaux saves Bogota just in time, but Lagos suffers an outbreak. Curie
cures Radalia and flies to Ho Chi Minh in preparation for transferring
research to Akira. It is then pointed out that Ho CHi Minh is extremely
likely to suffer an outbreak, unless an epidemic occurs that could
result in too many outbreaks elsewhere across the world. Unwilling to
countenance even the slightest chance of failure, Curie self-sacrifices
(becoming <em>Indecisive</em>) to ensure a safe world. Akira immediately flys
to Tokyo to collect research from Jeaux, and then flys to Ho Chi Minh to
do the same with Curie. Thus Akira is able to cure Terrancella and the
the team succeeds! While at the end the infection was reaching dangerous
levels, it was the solid treating and quarantining at the start gave the
team space to find cures despite some unlucky research.</p>

<p>Curie becomes <em>Flexible</em> and gains <em>Archive Access</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Victory <em>[cure, find virologist and military bases]</em></p>
