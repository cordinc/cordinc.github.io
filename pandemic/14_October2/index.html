<h4 id="late-october-played-20161120">Late October (played 2016/11/20)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Jimi Harkonen (Operations Expert) - Ann</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Ivan</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Fung</li>
  <li>Stephen Putin Segal (Immunologist) - Charles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (3 out of 4 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Sabotage 2 military bases</li>
  <li>Vaccinate 6 Faded cities</li>
  <li>Have 3 Vaccine Factories</li>
</ul>

<p>Segal the <em>Immunologist</em> and Jimi the <em>Operations Expert</em> replace Jeaux
and Goldie for late October. Early infections of Terrancella are heavy
and a new military base has appeared in Madrid. The team start in Sao
Paulo.</p>

<p>Akira positions Segal in HCMC, and he immediately vaccinates the city.
While there is another outbreak in Algiers due to <em>Accelerated
Infection</em>. Curie cures Na-jib almost immediately and with no infections
having yet occurred, it is eradicated! Jimi builds a vaccine factory in
New York. Not even an outbreak in Buenos Aires leaving Akira
<em>Pyrophoric</em> dampens the teams high spirits. With Akira helping people
into position, Segal vaccinates Bangkok and Curie clears Sydney.</p>

<p>An epidemic causes outbreaks in Milan and Mumbai, but Madrid is safe due
to being under quarantine. The team then realises that vaccinating
cities in Europe will be extremely hard as there are 3 military bases on
the continent. Jimi destroys the Paris base. Curie vaccinates Jakarta.
Akira moves Segal to Tehran, and then makes a fortuitous research
breakthrough in Terrancella resulting in its cure. Segal clears and
vaccinates Tehran at the expense of becoming <em>Intimidated</em>. Then an
epidemic hits Mexico City.</p>

<p>Taking stock, the team realises curing Radalia is within reach - if
Akira moves Segal and Curie to Sao Paulo then research would be complete - and the mission would succeed soon after. Unfortunately, it is at this
point the team also realises they have let a time bomb develop in
Europe. Five interconnected Faded cities are all on the edge of
exploding: Madrid, Algiers, Paris, Milan and Istanbul. If any one has an
outbreak the mission would fail. Much discussion ensues about whether it
possible to defend against this result. It is decided the only way would
be for 3 of the team to self-sacrifice and the loss of Curie. Deemed
unacceptable, this plan is abandoned and fingers are crossed. Luck is
not on their side, the research is shared and Paris is cleared, but
Milan outbreaks and the resulting cascade causes a second mission
failure.</p>

<p>London and New York gain permanent vaccine factories.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Loss <em>[too many outbreaks]</em></p>
