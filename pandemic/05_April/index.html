<h4 id="april-played-20160221">April (played 2016/02/21)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Dominique (Quarantine Specialist) - Charles</li>
  <li>Bobbie (Researcher) - Kai</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Ann</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Ivan</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (2 out of 3 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Eradicate at least 1 disease</li>
  <li>Have a military base in each of the 6 world regions</li>
</ul>

<p>Bobbie returns from holiday while Head takes a break in April. Initial
reports show no CoDa infections - instead the worst affected cities are
within a single move of team members starting in Atlanta. Such luck!
There is even a “free” military base in Baghdad. Confidence is high.</p>

<p>Initial plans see the some of the American infections cleared while
Akira jumps to Baghdad and starts laying down quarantines from the
military base. Research into Radalia progresses nicely. Bobbie clears
East Europe. Then 2 epidemics in a row <em>[adjacent players]</em> strain the
team. <em>One Quiet Night</em> prevents a near certain outbreak as a number of
cities test their containment thresholds: Delhi, Khartoum, Madrid,
Montreal &amp; Chicago are all problematic <em>[3 cubes]</em>. Plus the CoDa
virus becomes Fade. Heated discussion ensues as the team realise they
can’t be everywhere in time. It is decided that Fade is the most
pressing concern. An unfunded <em>Grassroots Program</em> is used to bring
Delhi out of the danger zone. A quarantine on Khartoum and few cured
people in Madrid results in crossed fingers. As infection hits Madrid
and Khartoum relatively harmlessly much backslapping ensues. Especially
since Radalia is cured soon after and a <em>Resilent Population</em> is created
in Delhi as soon as the possibility appears.</p>

<p>The team splits - half trying to deal mainly with infections while the
remainder conduct research. It is a struggle to clear the heavily
infected cities and another epidemic causes a Sydney outbreak. However,
immense luck and many discussions on probability prevent further chaos.
Also, even more luck and timely shared knowledge brings cures for both
Terrancella &amp; Na-Jib. The team now just need to eradicate a disease or
build 5 more military bases. A discussion of possibilities concludes
that eradicating Terrancella will be the fastest.</p>

<p>Then disaster, another epidemic. Some quick calculations suggest that
there will be 3 infections occurring in 12 cities, 5 of which will have
bad results: 4 are near their infection threshold, plus Cairo is
unquarantined and open to Fade infection. Breath is held as the infected
cities are revealed. Two fall in relatively unimportant cities, although
one is Terrancella delaying eradication slightly. The third is Cairo, it
becomes <em>City Zero</em> of the Fade infection. The team continues to clear
Terrancella, just hoping their luck holds. The next three cities to be
infected are again unimportant. Plus a <em>Local Initiative</em> is funded and
used immediately in Lagos &amp; Miami, which are then infected next.
Incredible luck has saved another 2 outbreaks! The team is ecstatic,
only an epidemic can stop them now.</p>

<p>The epidemic does not come! Terancella is eradicated despite late
outbreaks in Washington and Santiago. The world is saved again!</p>

<p>At the end of April and 5 months of global pandemics Tehran &amp; Algiers
are rioting. London, Cairo, Baghdad, Khartoum, Lagos, Osaka, Bogota,
Chicago, Washington, Santiago &amp; Sydney are unstable. Cairo gets an
unfunded <em>Airstrike Program</em> and a permanent military base is
constructed in Baghdad (next to the permanent Research Station in
Istanbul). Cairo is City Zero of the Fade infection, but there are no
other Faded cities. No team member is scarred.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Win <em>[cure + eradicate]</em></p>
