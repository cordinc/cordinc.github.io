<h4 id="early-october-played-20161120">Early October (played 2016/11/20)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>GI Jeaux (Soldier) - Charles</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Ivan</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Ann</li>
  <li>Goldie (Virologist) - Fung</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (3 out of 4 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Quarantine 7 Faded cities</li>
  <li>Find Patient Zero</li>
  <li>Sabotage 2 military bases</li>
</ul>

<p>November begins with a mass of Faded infections as the team digests the
revelation that Pink was a traitor helping spread disease rather than
cure. Goldie the <em>Virologist</em> joins the team in Istanbul to replace the
traitor. It seems like an age since the last outing, and the team is a
little rusty in the execution of their duties.</p>

<p>Akira starts by moving Jeaux and Goldie to city zero, Cairo, and they
immediately begin to search for patient zero. Curie starts accumulating
Radalia research and moves to South America to cure disease. An early
epidemic hits Manila, but to no great effect. Soon Jeaux (regularly
reacquiring old search equipment) finds patient zero and collects the
required DNA sample. Goldie heads to Asia as the global situation is
looking positive.</p>

<p>Disaster strikes. <em>Accelerated Infection</em> sees Algiers outbreak,
followed immediately by an epidemic and outbreak in Osaka. There is a
small respite as Curie finds a cure for Radalia, and Akira moves people
into position for a fightback. However, outbreaks in Algiers and Bangkok
start to put the mission on a downward trajectory. Jeaux burns down the
Algiers military base just before an outbreak in Istanbul destroys the
research centre there and cascades to Moscow. The map is now covered in
Faded infections. Goldie becomes <em>Weakened</em> as the situation appears
dire.</p>

<p>At this point the <em>Immunologist</em> returns with news from the recovered
DNA sample <em>[we had forgot to open box 7]</em>. We now have a vaccine for
CoDA and can build factories to produce it. Hope is renewed. Goldie
self-sacrifices (<em>Monophobic</em>) to provide breathing room. Very useful as
there is epidemic in LA that passes without any outbreak. Curies cures
Na-jib, but outbreaks in Algiers and Bangkok are just too much to handle
and the mission is over.</p>

<p>Ho Chi Minh City gains a Vaccine Factory and Bioreactor equipment is
acquired.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Loss <em>[too many outbreaks]</em></p>
