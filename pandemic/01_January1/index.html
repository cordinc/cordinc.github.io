<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bobbie (Researcher) - Ann</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Charles</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Kai</li>
  <li>Gwyneth Paltrow Head (Medic) - Ivan</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to all 4 diseases</li>
</ul>

<p>The CDC team assembles in Atlanta. Everyone is very experienced in
dealing with previous pandemics successfully, so January seems like
nothing special. Initial infections are concentrated in South America
and southern Africa.</p>

<p>The team begins by dealing with the Radalia-X <em>[yellow]</em> plague. They mainly work independently and clear
infections steadily with research building towards a Na-Jib <em>[blue]</em> outbreak in Tehran. Then almost immediately
another epidemic occurs with an outbreak in Algiers. It transpires that
the CoDA <em>[black]</em> virus could not be cured and was significantly harder than
normal to treat <em>[2 actions per cube]</em>. Plans are abandoned as the
team rushes towards the Middle East in an attempt to control the fast
spreading CoDA outbreak. They succeed for a while, but new CoDA
infections occurr across south Asia and take too long to clear. Another
couple of closely spaced epidemics result in another Tehran outbreak
cascading into a Baghdad outbreak and the team has failed.</p>

<p>Tehran is rioting, Baghdad &amp; Algiers are unstable. A permanent research
station is constructed in Istanbul so the CDC could react quicker to
CoDA infections. Bobbie became a <em>Pilot</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Loss <em>[out of black disease cubes]</em></p>
