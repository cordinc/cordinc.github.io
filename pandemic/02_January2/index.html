<h4 id="late-january-played-20160123">Late January (played 2016/01/23)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Bobbie (Researcher) - Kai</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Charles</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Ann</li>
  <li>Gwyneth Paltrow Head (Medic) - Ivan</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured)</li>
</ul>

<p>Shaken by the speed at which the early January pandemics spiralled out
of control, the same team reassembles in late January determined to
cooperate better. Still they know the situation is dire. Initial
infections again concentrate in South America, although to a lesser
extent than earlier in the month. So the team starts in Atlanta and fans
out, quickly collecting Radalia-X and Na-Jib research. Bobbie largely
roams the Middle East and south Asia, to treat CoDA infections before
they became overwhelming. The rest of the team criss-crosses the world
as required, trading and concentrating research. The Americas are
quickly cleared from danger - slow, but steady. Radalia-X is cured
first, but not before outbreaks in Algiers, London and Osaka (all
quickly contained). Na-Jib is then cured at the cost of a Lagos outbreak
cascading to Khartoum.</p>

<p>Confidence is still high. <em>One Quiet Night</em> and <em>Forecast</em> see a
potentially devastating epidemic fizzle harmlessly. Curing Terrancella
is within reach. With preparations finished, Curie just needs access to
a Research Station to complete the cure. There is still ample time in
the month and forecasts suggest the probability of another epidemic is
low <em>[there are a large stack of player cards and only a single
possible epidemic left]</em>. The CoDA situation is concerning with the
virus building up faster than it can be cleared despite Bobbieâ€™s
constant attention. Otherwise, the situation is reasonably under
control.</p>

<p>However, luck takes bad turn. Before Curie can reach a station another
epidemic strikes - in the worst possible place! Cairo explodes causing
cascading outbreaks to Baghdad and Algiers. And it is over - another
failure. It is only by luck that the virus exhausted itself before an
outbreak in Istanbul could destroy the station there.</p>

<p>By the end of January both Tehran &amp; Algiers are rioting, with London,
Cairo, Baghdad, Khartoum, Lagos &amp; Osaka unstable. Luckily a <em>Common
Structure</em> for both Radalia-X and Terrancella is discovered so they can
be cured without travelling to a station in future.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Loss <em>[out of black disease cubes]</em></p>
