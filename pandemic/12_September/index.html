<h4 id="september-played-20161007">September (played 2016/10/07)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Clarissa Pink (Colonel) - Fung</li>
  <li>GI Jeaux (Soldier) - Ivan</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Ann</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Charles</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (3 out of 5 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Quarantine 7 Faded cities</li>
  <li>Have a military base in each of the 6 world regions <em>[already
complete]</em></li>
  <li>Find the Paranoid Soldier</li>
  <li>Find the Immunologist</li>
</ul>

<p>Again the same CDA team comes together to fight the global pandemics. A
successful pattern to the games has emerged: Curie hunts cures, Pink and
Jeaux keep CoDA under control, while Akira ensures everyone is where
they need to be. The plan stays the same for September. At the start of
the month the team learns there is a new objective, find a paranoid
soldier spreading conspiracy theories, he is in one of the military
bases in a CoDA city. Despite this new objective, the team elects after
some discussion to start the month with the search for the Immunologist
a little advanced - first come, first served. Also, as there is a
military base in each world region, the team starts with one objective
already completed.</p>

<p>The team begins again in Istanbul as the main infections are in northern
Europe. Curie starts by laying the now obligatory quarantine in Istanbul
before heading north to deal with the infected cities there. Jeaux then
searches for the Immunologist, until the team is quickly interrupted by
an epidemic centred on San Francisco. Luckily <em>Local Initiatives</em> keep
London and San Francisco from causing any further damage. Pink heads
towards Asia, while Akira heads to North America. The team slowly starts
clearing disease, but it is the number of heavily infected cities starts
to build - outbreaks seem certain.</p>

<p>Confidence returns slightly when Jeaux finds the Immunologist in
Baghdad. She informs us that CoDA appears bio-engineered, a vaccine is
possible, but more data is required. This information is quickly
digested as the team continues to deal with Na-Jib. Pink reaches and
clears the worst of Asia’s Terrancella infections, before heading to
meet with Curie for research exchange. Akira clears the worst of North
America and Curie gets northern Europe under control. The situation is
looking good. Soon it is even better, as a lucky bit of research sees
Curie cure Terrancella with <em>Pluripotent Stem Cells</em>. Now confidence is
high, only two more cures required and the crisis is over, with a Na-jib
cure just waiting for some shared research. The team also is lucky with
few CoDA infections appearing and a large gap between epidemics
<em>[although another must be coming soon]</em>.</p>

<p>Jeaux takes the lapse in urgency to search for the paranoid soldier and
finds him immediately in Baghdad (with judicious and repeated use of
<em>Binoculars</em>). Oh no, CoDA is part of a military conspiracy. The
non-military team members laugh, but that ceases when it transpires that
<em>Colonel</em> Pink is a traitor and leaves the team to be replaced with a
civilian. This also means the planned shared research is gone - the
Na-Jib cure is no longer a certainty. Now the team is aiming to sabotage
military bases, rather than build them. An epidemic follows quickly
centred on Kolkata.</p>

<p>The new, unnamed, civilian team member does their duty by eradicating
Terrancella. Na-Jib infections start to reemerge despite some lucky
research seeing Curie cure the disease. Faded infections also start to
fan out from the Indian subcontinent, with Jeaux taking great pleasure
in clearing them with <em>Grenades</em> and a <em>Grassroots Program</em>. Another
epidemic and outbreak hits in Washington, followed by an outbreak in
Chennai <em>[becoming the world’s first fallen city]</em> cascading to the
now collapsing Kolkata. Infections begin to spread out of control.</p>

<p>The future seems bleak. A path towards a Radalia-X cure is planned, but
there will almost certainly be another epidemic before it can be
completed. The likelihood of the next epidemic overwhelming the world is
very high and the team can’t afford the time to prepare for the
onslaught if a cure is to be found in time. Despondency reigns. Then
Jeaux stands and suggests self-sacrifice. Curie is <em>Hobbled</em>, and Jeaux
becomes <em>Overcautious</em>. However the plan works: Akira cures Radalia-X
and the world is again safe, after a month of extreme emotions.</p>

<p>Terrancella gains <em>Easier Agents</em> and Sao Paulo obtains a permanent
research station.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Win <em>[cure, find immunologist, find paranoid soldier and
sabotage 2 military bases]</em></p>
