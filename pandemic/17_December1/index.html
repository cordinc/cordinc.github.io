<h4 id="early-december-played-20161211">Early December (played 2016/12/11)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Stephen Putin Segal (Immunologist) - Charles</li>
  <li>Bobbi (Researcher) - Ivan</li>
  <li>Jimi Harkonen (Operations Expert) - Ann</li>
  <li>GI Jeaux (Soldier) - Fung</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (2 out of 2 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Vaccinate all Faded cities</li>
  <li>Discover the secret stockpile in Atlanta</li>
</ul>

<p>December starts with a surprise. The team no longer needs to cure
disease, but instead vaccinate all Faded cities to bring the engineered
virus under control and then find a CoDA stockpile in Atlanta to prevent
further infection. The military conspiracy taunt the team, but
confidence is high as there only a handful of unvaccinated cities remain
and the initial infections are minimal.</p>

<p>Starting in Atlanta, Jeaux begins the stockpile search before flying to
the vaccine factory in Karachi. Disaster immediately strikes as an
epidemic hits Delhi. Segal destroys the military base in Ho Chi Minh,
the last permanent base. Meanwhile Jimi advances the search double the
standard amount before vaccinating Karachi, and Bobbi clears Buenos
Aires. Sudden outbreaks in Beijing and Delhi remind everyone that
diseases other than CoDA still exist, and concentrations are building in
Asia.</p>

<p>The team switches to treating disease with Tapei, Shanghai and Beijing
all brought back from the brink. With Hong Kong vaccinated and Delhi
cleared, the immediate concern in lifted and the search resumes with
everyone except Segal returning to Atlanta. Although Jimi
opportunistically cures Terrancella in a slight deviation from the
original plan.</p>

<p>Then an epidemic hits LA, but <em>One Quiet Night</em> controls the situation.
To prevent damage Bobbi self-sacrifices - presciently as another
epidemic immediately hits Washington. Segal saves Washington from
certain disaster by clearing it, after vaccinating Riyahd. The situation
is delicately poised as Jeaux brings the stockpile search to the halfway
point, and only 4 unvaccinated faded cities.</p>

<p>There is an outbreak in LA as the team repositions themselves across the
globe. Bobbi vaccinates Mumbai, and Jeaux destroys the last military
base in Istanbul, but fails to clear the city - if someone else does not
clear it soon he will become too psychologically scarred to continue.
Epidemic hits Lima and there is an outbreak in LA. This is ignored, as
is another outbreak in Shanghai while the team rushes to vaccinate.
Bobbi vaccinates Moscow. With <em>Borrowed Time</em>, Segal clears Istanbul
then vaccinates both it and St Petersburg.</p>

<p>Thus all Faded cities are vaccinated and the team reconverges on Atlanta
to continue the stockpile search. Steady progress is made, but not for
long. An outbreak in Lima cascades to LA and then to Mexico City. Time
has run out, and the team is recalled. Notably LA suffered 3 outbreaks
this month, going from mild rioting to completely <em>Fallen</em> - truly the
forgotten city.</p>

<p>GI Jeaux becomes a <em>Hacker</em> and more equipment is added.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Loss <em>[too many outbreaks]</em></p>
