<h4 id="early-july-played-20160515">Early July (played 2016/05/15)</h4>

<p><strong>Players:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Clarissa Pink (Colonel) - Ann</li>
  <li>GI Jeaux (Soldier) - Kai</li>
  <li>Akira (Dispatcher) - Charles</li>
  <li>Marie Curie (Scientist) - Fung</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Objectives (3 out of 5 required):</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Discover cures to 3 diseases (CoDA can not be cured) [mandatory]</li>
  <li>Quarantine 7 Faded cities</li>
  <li>Eradicate at least 1 disease</li>
  <li>Have a military base in each of the 6 world regions</li>
  <li>Find the Virologist</li>
</ul>

<p>The CDC team reforms in July with a more militaristic plan. <em>Colonel</em>
Pink returns and <em>Soldier</em> GI Jeaux (a friend of Pink) joins the team.
The plan is to build a military base in North America while Curie
researches cures and eradicates a disease. Pink and Jeaux will deal with
Faded cities. No one seems interested in searching for the Virologist.
The team starts in Istanbul with major infections in Beijing, Santiago
and Baghdad.</p>

<p>Akira starts by moving everyone except Pink to Algiers, so that Curie
can collect <em>Pluripotent Stem Cells</em> from Jeaux bringing a Na-jib cure
to within a single piece of research. Unfortunately, <em>Accelerated
Infection</em> hits Istanbul, causing Pink to become <em>Over-cautious</em>. Pink
lays down quarantines across Faded cities, as does Jeaux as they head
towards Asia. Akira moves Pink and Curie to Washington so they can share
research, a Na-jib cure is imminent. However, before that can happen an
epidemic occurs in Chennai and there is an outbreak in Seoul.</p>

<p>The team is becoming concerned about the situation in North-eat Asia.
Correctly as it transpires as a second epidemic hits right after the
first - in Shanghai. Increased infection in Seoul causes another
outbreak which cascades to Shanghai and Beijing. With high levels of
infection in Shanghai &amp; Beijing certain to occur before much can be
done, the situation looks dire. However, a <em>Local Initiative</em> program is
funded straight after the epidemic - the situation is saved! Or is it. A
discussion ensues about whether it is worth using the <em>Local Initiative</em>
to quarantine Terrancella infected cities and allow the fight to
continue. Alternatively if the situation is truly hopeless then perhaps
the Asian north-east should be sacrificed as relatively unimportant to
allow the team to regroup quickly and start again in late July. Akira is
a proponent of the latter, suggesting that ending with riots in Asia is
probably not as bad as other possible results. The rest of the team
consider the proposition carefully, but all decide it is their duty to
carry on. Akira is outvoted and a quarantine is placed on Shanghai &amp;
Beijing and subsequently a <em>Grassroots Program</em> clears enough disease
from Beijing to relieve the immediate pressure.</p>

<p>As Curie builds towards a Terrancella cure, the team wonders what to do
and tries to rebuild plans. Akira is despondent, but everyone puts in a
best effort. An epidemic in Paris is halted thanks to quarantine.
Quarantines are reapplied across the world. Terrancella is cured,
although Radalia is turning out to be hard to research. Undaunted the
team moves towards Terrancella eradication as the problematic Asian
north-east is cleared.</p>

<p>Then disaster. <em>Accelerated Infection</em> strikes Delhi causing an outbreak
cascading to further outbreaks in Tehran and Chennai (which starts to
collapse). The team is recalled, a little over half way through the
allotted time.</p>

<p>Akira becomes a <em>Veteran</em> and Pink gains a <em>Paramilitary Escort</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Result:</strong> Loss <em>[too many outbreaks]</em></p>
