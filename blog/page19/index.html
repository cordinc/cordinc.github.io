<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/448830/">ASMR Universe</a>, what is it?
I don’t think it is a game, instead it is a tool for creating
soundscapes. It is very simple and very roughly constructed, but maybe
something certain people want.</p>

    <p>Part 1 is <a href="/blog/2016/08/rbs-1.html">available here</a>.</p>

<p>As the <a href="/blog/2016/08/rbs-1.html">SCRS project</a> at RBS began to come to
a finish, the team started to disperse. I was the last technical person
to leave and to prevent me leaving RBS entirely, the SCRS project manger
arranged for my contract to transfer over to the Sales Account Opening
(SAO) project so I could still be around if SCRS needed me. They didn’t,
so my last 9 months at RBS were spent on the largest most dysfunctional
IT project I have ever seen.</p>

<p>SAO aimed to allow potential and existing customers of RBS to open
accounts online. Current accounts, savings, credit cards, overdrafts,
the whole range of retail account should be available. Basically it was
a set of webpages that took a customer’s information, and then passed it
through to various backend systems to actually create the account and
send out any required paper forms. At the time many banks were setting
up similar systems - now it is expected functionality for a bank’s
online presence, but still fairly new for most banks in early 2004 when
I started on the project. The technical difficulty was not particularly
high, but greatly complicated by non-technical factors. The final system
had to integrate with the existing customer database and credit checking
systems. The information collected had to meet anti-money laundering,
fraud and terrorism laws (collectively referred to as “Know Your
Customer” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a>).
Security and reliability had to be bulletproof as this was a public
website and must inspire confidence in potential customers. The site
also needed to look pretty, well-designed and enticing. The webpages
needed to conform to UK &amp; EU disability laws, so blind people or people
unable to use a mouse or a raft of other issues should still be able to
use the system easily. Also, RBS owned a number of subsidiary banks.
They would all use this system too since they all shared the same
backend. This meant the webpages had to change branding, wording and
structure to match the bank being viewed.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After Java developers became surplus to requirements at the <a href="/blog/2014/10/prs.html">MCPS-PRS
Alliance</a> I had to suddenly hunt around for work
again. The PRS people were very nice to me and had no problems with me
looking for new jobs while at work. With almost year of working in
London behind me, it was surprisingly easy to get interviews. Rather
than the months of waiting previously experienced, a number of positions
came through agents quite quickly. The best of these was at <a href="http://www.rbs.co.uk">Royal Bank
of Scotland</a> (RBS), in their corporate and retail
banking operations (very separate and distinct from their investment
banking operations).</p>

<p>So I began a 3 month contract as a Team Leader on the Service Charge
Review System (SCRS) just as it started. The project had a 12 month
timeline, so if things went well I expected to hang around for further
contracts. SCRS was driven by the corporate relationship managers. These
are the people who dealt with businesses, big and small. Unlike retail
customers (normal people going to bank branches), businesses and
corporations paid a raft of fees for the services they use (thus service
charges). While there are a set of “standard” fees that businesses pay
by default, in reality all the fees are negotiable. The bigger the
business, the more negotiable the fees they pay. There are a large
number of possible fees, from receiving a cheque, running a credit card
or having an overdraft. Perhaps a medium-sized consumer firm has a need
for large amount of cash-handling (cash passed to a branch has to be
secured, counted and transported), but rarely makes international
transfers. It might look for the cash fees to be lowered in return for
higher international fees. Part of a relationship managers’ job is to
work out if that is a change the bank is willing to make, and if so
arrange it. The relationship managers also create speculative fee
structures to tempt business to shift banks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.one-man-games.com/artificial-defense">Artificial Defense</a> is
a fun stylish orbital shooter with some tower defense gameplay.
Developed by a solo-dev, the game shows a high level polish with tons of
nice little touches. It is a pretty and fun game that can keep players
entertained for hours (as I have).</p>

already an enjoyable alpha nicely showing off this promising programming
