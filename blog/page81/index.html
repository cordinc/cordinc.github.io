  <div class="content">
    <p>I have just completed my 50th online poker game. I lost. My top pair
turned into a straight on the river and so I went all-in against a
player who check-called. Turned out he made a full house on the flop!
Now seems like a suitable milestone to think again about my play.</p>

<p>After the home games I thought I’d try online poker for real money
(opposed to the online “play” money with which I learnt the game). So I
put US$50 on <a href="http://www.pokerstars.com">Pokerstars</a>. Pokerstars also
invited me to a beginner’s tournament, which seemed to be a ploy to get
some more money into newbies’ hands - I won US$32. Thus I started with
US$82 and that is my baseline. I decided to focus on one type of game
and chose micro stakes heads-up Hold’em sit’n’go tournaments. That is,
there are two players, each puts in US$2.20 for a set number of chips
and play until one person has all the chips. The winner gets US$4 and
the site US$0.40 in fees - the loser gets nothing. There are always a
couple of these games going so you can play whenever you want. It would
take a long time to go broke and with a single opponent I could learn
the basics in the simplest environment possible.</p>

<p>At first I started winning. I think I won my first 3 games straight. I
started dreaming of becoming a poker pro. Then I starting losing,
dropping to around the US$60 mark after nearly 20 games. I started
paying more attention to the game and writing down results - 5/10, then
7/10, then 8/10, lastly a loss to reach the 50 game mark. In total I
have won 25, lost 25. Thus, due to fees I have US$72 - US$10 down on
where I started. I think in the right circumstances I can beat this
level of the game. In the final eleven games I played noticeably worse
than my opponent three times (I lost one and won two - lucky). Winning 7
out of 10 seems a reasonable goal. Which at about 2.5 hours per 10 games
equates to roughly £1/hour (hence the title).</p>

<p>There is however one small problem. I have a tendency to tilt. Tilt is a
great concept in poker, it is when for whatever reason you are not
playing rationally and letting your emotions influence your decisions.
This can be getting bored; overbetting back at someone who is annoying;
or a vast range of other suboptimal play. I certainly think that my
poker maths skills have a great deal of room for improvement, but that
doesn’t seem to matter too much at my level. My opponents have a lot to
learn too. What seems to separate us, in my limited experience, is
temperament. Over the last 30 games or so I focussed mainly on ensuring
I was in an appropriate frame of mind before starting (patient, relaxed,
time to play and a desire to win) and stopping if I felt this slipping.
That lead to the improvement.</p>

<p>So what now? I have started reading a book on poker theory, so hopefully
my game will slowly improve. Other than that I aim to control my
tendency to tilt. I’ll play another 50 games (which will take a couple
of months) and aim to win 70%, which would mean I break US$100. If I can
manage this and I think I’m playing well, I’ll consider going up a level
or trying a different game.</p>

    <p>Recently for a little project I wanted to get weather reports, and being
in London my first thought was to use <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/">BBC
weather</a>. Doing a little searching, the
BBC provides a number of RSS feeds for its data (news, weather, etc), as
part of the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">Backstage</a> project. Details of
the weather feeds are
<a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/data/WeatherFeeds">here</a>. This post gives
some of the tips and tricks I discovered using these feeds.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last Friday I went to the <a href="http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps (FOWA) London 2008
conference</a>. As I only had the
single day off work I decided to get the expo only entrance (£5) rather
than a two-day full pass for nearly £400. Thus I didn’t get to see any
of the proper talks, instead I just walked around the floor to see the
booths and one “FOWA university” talk.</p>

<p>The talk was by <a href="http://www.yuuguu.com">Yuuguu</a> on how to run a company
when all employees telecommute. Apparently, the FOWA conference is the
first time all the Yuuguu employees have met at the same time. Most of
the talk was fairly bland and many in the audience were head down on
their laptops or iPhones. However, there were a few interesting points.
Yuuguu people don’t work if they meet in person, they consider the time
too important to waste on work and they bond instead. Also, every Friday
they get together online for virtual “beers”.</p>

<p>There were a couple dozen companies with booths. A few big names like
Microsoft, Sun and Myspace were there, but most were firms I had never
heard mentioned before. This caused some awkward experiences, as their
names normally give no hint as to their business areas. I would squint
at their posters trying to work out what they did (which often didn’t
help much either). Meanwhile some marketing person would creep up on me,
start talking and give me their <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo mini business
card</a> (these were literally everywhere). I left the
conference knowing what every exhibiting business did, but only about
half of them were marginally relevant to me.</p>

<p>The Microsoft booth was by far the best. Among the computers they had a
couple of Xboxs and a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface">Surface box</a> -
the Xboxs were empty while it was hard to see the Surface through the
crowd. Rightly so, it was an impressive machine. All that made me want
to code rather than talk and I left after an hour, skipping the
Diggnation filming - I saw it last year. Anyway if want you can see the
FOWA talks

    <p>A friend recently mentioned that there is dumb money on
<a href="http://www.intrade.com">Intrade</a>, a site that creates markets in
various real-life events such as the US Presidential elections. They
said that there are still people betting that Hillary Clinton will
become President in November. I’m a big fan of free money so I thought
I’d check it out. Sure enough, according to Intrade, there is a 1.6%
chance Hillary will be elected President, with thousands of dollars
worth of contracts available. I’ll grant the chance of Hillary being
elected as non-zero, but it must be orders of magnitude less than 1.6%,
so what’s going on? It was a quiet day so I thought I’d work out if it
was a scam or a bad deal.</p>

    <p>This <a href="http://blog.ativiti.com/wheres-the-task-management-category-killer/">blog
article</a>
argues that current online todo list and project management tools don’t
meet people’s needs and are too complex. Judging by the comments of some
people at the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/10/london-hacker-meetup-6.html">London Hackers
Meetup</a>,
this is not an uncommon view. I agree too. This is why I’m trying to
steer a user-friendly middle-path between Queuesarus’ competitors - a
group it seems Ativiti intends to join (yeah, bring it on!).</p>

<p>So how is it going? Well the Beta testing suggests that the
functionality is nearly good enough, but that it is still not
user-friendly. I’m not sure what to do. While I knew some parts of the
system were difficult to understand, I had a plan for them. However,
there are problems with areas I thought were fine. As the blog says, it
is a hard problem and I haven’t seen it done well. More thought is
required, and advice is welcome.</p>
