    <p>Recently for a little project I wanted to get weather reports, and being
in London my first thought was to use <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/">BBC
weather</a>. Doing a little searching, the
BBC provides a number of RSS feeds for its data (news, weather, etc), as
part of the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">Backstage</a> project. Details of
the weather feeds are
<a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk/data/WeatherFeeds">here</a>. This post gives
some of the tips and tricks I discovered using these feeds.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last Friday I went to the <a href="http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps (FOWA) London 2008
conference</a>. As I only had the
single day off work I decided to get the expo only entrance (£5) rather
than a two-day full pass for nearly £400. Thus I didn’t get to see any
of the proper talks, instead I just walked around the floor to see the
booths and one “FOWA university” talk.</p>

<p>The talk was by <a href="http://www.yuuguu.com">Yuuguu</a> on how to run a company
when all employees telecommute. Apparently, the FOWA conference is the
first time all the Yuuguu employees have met at the same time. Most of
the talk was fairly bland and many in the audience were head down on
their laptops or iPhones. However, there were a few interesting points.
Yuuguu people don’t work if they meet in person, they consider the time
too important to waste on work and they bond instead. Also, every Friday
they get together online for virtual “beers”.</p>

<p>There were a couple dozen companies with booths. A few big names like
Microsoft, Sun and Myspace were there, but most were firms I had never
heard mentioned before. This caused some awkward experiences, as their
names normally give no hint as to their business areas. I would squint
at their posters trying to work out what they did (which often didn’t
help much either). Meanwhile some marketing person would creep up on me,
start talking and give me their <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo mini business
card</a> (these were literally everywhere). I left the
conference knowing what every exhibiting business did, but only about
half of them were marginally relevant to me.</p>

<p>The Microsoft booth was by far the best. Among the computers they had a
couple of Xboxs and a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface">Surface box</a> -
the Xboxs were empty while it was hard to see the Surface through the
crowd. Rightly so, it was an impressive machine. All that made me want
to code rather than talk and I left after an hour, skipping the
Diggnation filming - I saw it last year. Anyway if want you can see the
FOWA talks

    <p>A friend recently mentioned that there is dumb money on
<a href="http://www.intrade.com">Intrade</a>, a site that creates markets in
various real-life events such as the US Presidential elections. They
said that there are still people betting that Hillary Clinton will
become President in November. I’m a big fan of free money so I thought
I’d check it out. Sure enough, according to Intrade, there is a 1.6%
chance Hillary will be elected President, with thousands of dollars
worth of contracts available. I’ll grant the chance of Hillary being
elected as non-zero, but it must be orders of magnitude less than 1.6%,
so what’s going on? It was a quiet day so I thought I’d work out if it
was a scam or a bad deal.</p>

    <p>This <a href="http://blog.ativiti.com/wheres-the-task-management-category-killer/">blog
article</a>
argues that current online todo list and project management tools don’t
meet people’s needs and are too complex. Judging by the comments of some
people at the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/10/london-hacker-meetup-6.html">London Hackers
Meetup</a>,
this is not an uncommon view. I agree too. This is why I’m trying to
steer a user-friendly middle-path between Queuesarus’ competitors - a
group it seems Ativiti intends to join (yeah, bring it on!).</p>

<p>So how is it going? Well the Beta testing suggests that the
functionality is nearly good enough, but that it is still not
user-friendly. I’m not sure what to do. While I knew some parts of the
system were difficult to understand, I had a plan for them. However,
there are problems with areas I thought were fine. As the blog says, it
is a hard problem and I haven’t seen it done well. More thought is
required, and advice is welcome.</p>

    <p>Last Thursday I went to the “London Hacker Meetup #6”. These events are
organised as a London analogue to the dinners held for <a href="http://ycombinator.com/&quot;">Y
Combinator</a> startups in the US, although
anyone could go along. Never having been to an Y Combinator dinner, I
can’t compare to the original, but I definitely found it an interesting
evening and more welcoming than the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/07/techcrunch-pitch.html">Techcrunch
Pitch</a> event.
It was held in the <a href="http://www.songkick.com">Songkick</a> offices in
Spitalfields (actually over the market) and drew a crowd of around 30,
mainly youngish guys in very casual clothing (there were I think 3
women). I felt quite old and conspicuous in my work shirt and trousers.
Luckily everyone was polite and friendly even after I told them I worked
at a bank.</p>

<p>There were four quick talks.
<a href="http://www.connectivelogic.co.uk/">ConnectiveLogic</a> demonstrated their
product to easily create concurrent programs without writing any
concurent code - interesting, but I’d have to have a play before saying
more. <a href="http://fuzzwich.com/">Fuzzwich</a> showed their online product to
easily create simple flash animations. It looked fun and having tried it
out since I can say it definitely works as advertised - give it a try.
Mary (can’t remember the rest of her name) spoke about her music
recommendation project, <a href="http://theperceptron.com/">The Perceptron</a>.
Finally, a guy presented his idea for a startup, then asked if anyone
was interested in joining him and applying to Y Combinator. I was
tempted, but thought it would be hard to commit to a company with
someone I didn’t know at all. Also, I’m more invested in
<a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queuesaurus</a> and would need a good offer to
move right now.</p>

<p>After the talks we decamped to the local pub. I spoke to a couple of the
Fuzzwich people for a while. They moved from San Francisico to London to
be near their customers. We discussed how to pay employers (not so
little they aren’t committed but not too much, they also said an options
“cliff” was standard - that is if you are sacked within the “cliff”
period, usually a year, then your options are cancelled). We also spoke
about motivation and starting a company, their advice was “do it!” They
seem like nice people. Later I spoke to a person who had an idea for a
startup; but not the technical knowhow to implement it. This seems like
a common problem, there seemed to be a few such people around. My last
conversation was with a guy I met at the Pitch event. He said that the
company that pitched had since shutdown - we talked a bit about founder
commitment and how important it is. He didn’t seem discouraged at all;
he is now interviewing other startups founders to see if they suit him
(definitely the right way round!).</p>

<p>I certainly left with the impression that there is still a great deal of
activity in the London startup scene, even as the financial IT world
significantly slows.</p>
