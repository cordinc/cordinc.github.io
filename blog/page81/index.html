  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently travelled to Tunisia for a holiday. Visiting the ancient
ruined Roman city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dougga">Dougga</a> was a
highlight. It is quite hard to reach as an independent traveller. First
you have to find the Tunis Northern Bus Station (out of the tourist
areas), go on a 2-hour bus journey to Teboursouk (the closest town),
from there you arrange a return taxi trip to the ruins. Once there
though, it is quite impressive. We had the place almost to ourselves for
a couple of hours - perhaps we should have arranged for a longer stay
with the taxi driver, but we had to catch the last bus back to Tunis!
Some of the best photos I took are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157611388103847/">here on
Flickr</a>.
In future I will put more photos up under that Flickr account.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Now that I have a couple of sites up and running on the web, I thought
I’d talk about how I chose my hosting providers and how it’s going. For
those who just want the short version: I use
<a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> and am very happy with them. Read
on for more details.</p>

<p>When looking at potential hosts for my Rails web apps I took into
consideration price, speed/memory, reliability and flexibility. I
basically wanted something cheap, reliable and fast. I’ve been an
amateur sysadmin before (and at my first dotcom job was technically a
pro sysadmin), so I wasn’t scared of getting into the unix command line.
Thus support wasn’t important. Similarly for a small project, bandwidth,
email accounts and credit-card billing systems would not be used. I
wanted more than a hobbyist’s hosting site (even if that is exactly what
I am), but not costly, professional hosting.</p>

<p>My first thoughts were my domain name register,
<a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, or the host of this blog,
<a href="http://www.pair.com/">pair</a>. I know a number of people have issues with
GoDaddy, but I’ve always found them fine for buying domain names and I
can just ignore their constant upselling. However, I wasn’t sure about
their Rails hosting and a search only found bad stories (eg.
<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/godaddy_hosting_now_supports_rails.php">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/blog/2007/07/rails-on-godaddy.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.mcmoyer.com/2007/9/14/running-rails-on-godaddy-a-k-a-how-do-you-keep-a-geek-entertained">here</a>).
I’ve also been happy with the service Pair have provided with this blog
and associated static website. I didn’t find much online about their
Rails hosting and decided it would in any case be best to use different
providers for this blog and my Rails apps.</p>

<p>Next I took a look at some webpages specifically listing Rails web
hosts, such as on the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/RailsWebHosts">Rails
wiki</a>. Among the
massive listing there, special mention is made of
<a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a> and
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">EngineYard</a> on a couple of occasions.
Certainly, these two companies seem to be held in very high esteem in
the Rails community and host many well known Rails sites. However, they
are both quite expensive - aiming for the high-end market. Too expensive
for my goals or really anyone without funding. They are more
aspirational - it would be nice to one day need the services of such a
hosting firm.</p>

<p>I also found a couple of lists at
<a href="http://www.rubyonrailswebhost.com/">rubyonrailswebhost</a> and <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2006/01/01/rails-hosting/">Zen and
the Art of
Programming</a>. They
rate <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> and
<a href="http://www.site5.com/">Site5</a> highly and both hosts matched my needs:
dirt cheap (under $10/month) and with decent reliability according to
reviews. Before signing up I sent Antonio Cangiano at <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com">Zen and the Art
of Programming</a> (a decent Rails blog I now
subscribe to) an email asking if he had any updated advice since his
blog on hosting was nearly 2 years old. Antonio suggested a new name,
<a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a>. Slicehost use a virtualisation
system so that it appears to the hosted application that it has a whole
server to itself (albeit a fairly small server). This means that someone
else’s app can’t hog resources slowing down your app. With memory
intensive Rails apps this is very useful. They also have full command
line access - you basically start with a clean build and can
install/configure it how you like. While any “point and click” users
would find it daunting, this really appealed to me. They provide a
number of <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/">useful getting started
articles</a>, including some Rails ones, so
I was sold. They are more expensive than other hosts at $20/month for a
256MB, but I have been very happy with their service over the last 6
months.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I have been asked what time I get the forecasts for a location in my
<a href="http://www.cordinc.info/weather/">historical weather forecast system</a>.
The obvious problem being that if I read all the forecasts at nearly the
same time, different cities could be in different days due to differing
timezones.</p>

<p>The answer is, I read the forecasts at roughly midday in each of the
locations. That is, every hour I read the forecasts for the locations
where it is roughly midday. This is done by approximating the various
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">timezones</a> using the location’s
longitude. This isn’t exact - it doesn’t account for daylight savings or
places like China, which is all one timezone despite being wide enough
to be split into many. Generally it is accurate to within a couple of
hours - fine for the purpose. The code is below.</p>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> The weather_report project and the weather archive is no
more. The effort required to maintain it was too great, for more
information <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/11/the-weather-archive-is-not-mor.html">see
here</a>.</p>

<p>I often have ideas for little projects, most never go anywhere, but some
act as distractions and bother me until I complete them. Recently, I
wanted to know what the weather was in London a few days in the past.
Easy, I thought, I just find it online. I couldn’t. There are many sites
with the current weather or forecasts. However, I could not find any
with historical weather. So I quickly created one based on my knowledge
of <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/11/using-bbc-backstage-weather.html">BBC
Backstage</a>.</p>

<p>I have put the system up <a href="http://www.cordinc.info/weather">here</a>. It is
still at an early state, it may change or be shutdown. At the moment it
displays only last month’s historical weather forecasts.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I am doing some work with the Rails text_field_with_auto_complete
method to provide a dropdown list of completed options as a user types,
like <a href="http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&amp;hl=en">Google Suggest</a>.
However, I needed the item displayed in the dropdown to be different to
the item displayed when it is selected. I couldn’t find any help online.
So at first I thought I would need to override the AJAX code, but when I
looked I saw text_field_with_auto_complete already had this feature
built in.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>To find out how to use text_field_with_auto_complete, I recommend
this <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/102">Railscast</a> (I have watched
about a dozen Railscasts and they have all been great). My starting
setup is as described in the Railscast.</p>

<p>The trick to displaying something different to what was selected is to
have the field to be displayed hidden in the selection list. To do this
add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> with a class into the selection item with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">style='display:none'</code>. Thus the text in the div will not be displayed
in the dropdown, but the text is there. Put the text to show when an
item is selected into the hidden div. In the file to create the list of
selection items I had the following:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">% return </span><span class="k">unless</span> <span class="vi">@queues</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">% items </span><span class="o">=</span> <span class="vi">@queues</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">entry</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">content_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"li"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s2">"&lt;div class='wq_display' style='display:none'&gt;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">entry</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2"> &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='wq_full'&gt;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">entry</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name_and_owner</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&lt;/div&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">%&gt;</span>
<span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="sx">%= content_tag("ul", items) %&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then in call to the text_field_with_auto_complete method specify
<code class="highlighter-rouge">:select</code> in the fourth argument. The value of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">:select</code> is the
class name of the div to use for displaying. So I used the below and
voila, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">wq_full</code> div is displayed in the dropdown and the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">wq_display</code> div is displayed in the text box when selected!</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-erb" data-lang="erb">Queue <span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">text_field_with_auto_complete</span> <span class="ss">:add</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:queue</span><span class="p">,</span> 
       <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:size</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:maxlength</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">40</span> <span class="p">},</span> 
       <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:url</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">formatted_workqueues_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:js</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="ss">:method</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:get</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:param_name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'search'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:select</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span>  <span class="s1">'wq_display'</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This concept can be easily extended. I also needed a third field, one
containing the selection item’s id and have this passed back to the
server on submit. Thus I just add a new hidden div to the selection
items containing the id:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-erb" data-lang="erb"><span class="cp">&lt;%</span> <span class="n">items</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vi">@queues</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">map</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">entry</span><span class="o">|</span> <span class="n">content_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"li"</span><span class="p">,</span> 
	<span class="s2">"&lt;div class='wq_display' style='display:none'&gt;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">entry</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='wq_full'&gt;# {entry.name_and_owner}&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class='wq_id' style='display:none'&gt;</span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">entry</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">id</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">&lt;/div&gt;"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span>
<span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">content_tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"ul"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">items</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="cp">%&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Then I use <code class="highlighter-rouge">:after_update_element</code> to provide a javascript function that
runs after an item is selected. Here it sets the value of a hidden input
field to the text inside the new div.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-erb" data-lang="erb">Queue <span class="cp">&lt;%=</span> <span class="n">text_field_with_auto_complete</span> <span class="ss">:add</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:queue</span><span class="p">,</span> 
       <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:size</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:maxlength</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">40</span> <span class="p">},</span> 
       <span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:url</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="n">formatted_workqueues_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="ss">:js</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="ss">:method</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="ss">:get</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:param_name</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s1">'search'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="ss">:select</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span>  <span class="s1">'wq_display'</span><span class="p">,</span>
          <span class="ss">:after_update_element</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="s2">"function(element,val) {
            var nodes = val.select('.wq_id') || [];
            if(nodes.length&gt;0) 
              $('wq_id').value =  Element.collectTextNodes(nodes[0], 'wq_id');

<p>You could also go further and update other parts of the page or have
other fields, but you should get the idea for now.</p>
