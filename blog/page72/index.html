    <p>Almost a year ago I wrote <a href="/blog/2009/02/new-goals.html">some goals for the new
year</a>. Now it is time for an assessment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal: Improve Ruby skills. Result: Partial success.</strong> I’m not at
what I would consider a professional standard, but not far off it. I
gemify’ed my BBC weather library, but have since abandoned it as
keeping up with the BBC’s constant API changes was frustrating. I
use <a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queusaurus</a> even if no one else
does. I started another project, but it didn’t get far enough to
publicise.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Learn Scala. Result: Have done some, but not much.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Learn Blender. Result: Near Success.</strong> I feel confident
enough about this one. I haven’t completed an ancient scene, but I’m
sure I could.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: Success.</strong>
Doing this slowly but surely - I own fewer things now than when I
wrote that goal, but not by much.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: 48 blog posts in a year. Result: 44 posts.</strong> I’m fairly
happy with that. Holidays and looking for a new work contract slowed
me down a bit.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Run 5km in 25 minutes. Result: Not even close.</strong> The less
said the better.</li>
  <li>On the stretch goals, all are still a long distance away.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the main problem with achieving those goals was my tendency to
try doing too much. At one point (and continuing for a couple of months)
I had 6 programming projects on the go at once. Nothing progressed at
any pace over the last half of the year and that is what caused the most
slippage. Something to be aware of for the coming year.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Having just completed the process of forming a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_company">limited company
under UK law</a>, I found
myself frustrated by the number of steps required. In case I ever need
to do it again, or a reader does, I thought it might be useful to set
out the steps I took - hopefully I haven’t missed any! If it seems
overwhelming, various accountancy or specialist firms can do most of it
for a fee. Note, I am not an expert in this area, just someone who has
done it once and recorded the steps - there is no guarantee this is
completely correct.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First get the company formed. This will require a unique company
name, a business address, and directors’ details. Forming the
company can be done through <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies
House</a>, but I used <a href="http://www.companiesmadesimple.com">Companies
Made Simple</a> to get things
moving quickly. I recommend getting a Printed Certificate of
Incorporation - it is needed in later steps.</li>
  <li>In my business, clients require invoices to have a VAT number so
registering for VAT was my next step. If you don’t need a VAT number
straight away, you may wish to get a bank account first. Also, if
the firm’s turnover is less than £68,000, registration is not
required. There are a few other exemptions too, see more at the
<a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=m&amp;r.l4=1073863071&amp;r.l1=1073858808&amp;r.lc=en&amp;r.l3=1083126677&amp;r.l2=1083126673&amp;topicId=1083126677&amp;r.i=1077722988&amp;r.t=BLTTOOL">Business Link VAT
guide</a>.
I applied for registration online through the <a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC Online
website</a> (click register) - the details
required should be the same as for company formation. HMRC also runs
a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/start/schemes/flat-rate.htm">Flat Rate VAT
scheme</a> that
is worth investigating. If it turns out to be useful then applying
to join the scheme can be done at the same time as registering for
VAT.</li>
  <li>Get a bank account. This is quite important as many of the other
steps need either bank details or a good reason why there are none
(eg VAT registration). Most banks will require a Printed Certificate
of Incorporation. I can’t recommend any good banks, and you should
be aware that it can take longer than you think to open a business
account.</li>
  <li>Sign up to file company documents online at <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies
House</a> (click on File documents
online). Even if the information given during formation never
change, the company will still need to submit at least two forms a
year to Companies House to stay registered (annual return and annual
accounts). This is easy to do online. At the same time you can sign
up for the
<a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/coIdFraud.shtml">PROOF</a>
system to make it harder for fraudsters to take control of the
company by filing paper forms. However, be aware that once you have
applied for online access, Companies House will (physically) mail
some activation forms before you can file online.</li>
  <li>If the company will be paying anyone a salary or expenses
(directors’ expenses count) then you will need to sign up to PAYE.
This can be done up to a month before payment. Again this can be
done through the <a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC website</a> (click
register). From the employer’s perspective, I find PAYE a bit
complicated. You should learn about it yourself -
<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/intro/index.htm">HMRC</a> and <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=m&amp;r.l1=1073858808&amp;r.lc=en&amp;topicId=1073858787">Business
Link</a>
are good places to start.</li>
  <li>In the weeks after forming the company, HMRC should send you some
forms to register for Corporate Tax. These need to be filled in and
returned within 3 months of business activity starting. Filling in
the forms will require the firm’s PAYE, VAT details, and the
Memorandum of Incorporation (this should have been included as part
of the formation process).</li>
  <li>Insurance may be required and is probably a good idea anyway. My
business area requires Professional Indemnity Insurance, so I
organised this before beginning trading. There are many other forms
of insurance which may be useful - my firm also has Employers’
Insurance and Public Liability Insurance. <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=sl&amp;r.lc=en&amp;topicId=1075196424">Business Link have a
guide</a>
to help determine which forms of insurance may be required. I used
an industry specialist insurer, which wouldn’t be useful to most
readers, but I have learnt to shop around as different firms can
quote vastly different rates (often the most expensive is multiples
of the cheapest).</li>
  <li>I recommend signing up to submit VAT, PAYE and Corporate Tax forms
through the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC website</a>. It is quite
good and normally guides you through the process of completing a
form; facing a long paper form fills me with fear. Also, if VAT is
paid by direct debit (which can be set up online) HMRC will give you
an extra week to pay (this can be done for PAYE too). After
initially applying online HMRC will send activation codes through
the mail to complete the process.</li>
  <li>Profit!</li>
</ul>

<p>After that I advise you quickly sort out your accounts and construct a
calendar of regulatory/tax events. Remember, every 3 months a VAT form
will need to be submitted. Depending on payroll size, PAYE will need to
be paid monthly or once a year in addition to an annual PAYE form (P35)
and expenses form (P11D). Corporate Tax forms need to be submitted
annually, as do Companies House returns and accounts. Staying organised
and being able to quickly determine the financial position of the firm
is very useful. Since my business is fairly simple and having completed
a course on accounting at uni, I created a double entry book-keeping
system in Excel. If you don’t feel you have the knowledge to do this (or
the firm’s accounts are too complicated) there are various software
packages and accountants that can help - I can’t recommend any.</p>

<p>In general, the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC</a> and <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">Business
Link</a> websites are very useful and well
worth a look.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <p>Ah, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton</a>
pattern. It is used to create a single, globally accessible instance of
a class, preventing any further instantiations (so only one object of
the class can ever exist). When I first learnt about Singletons soon
after leaving university, I thought they were wonderful and used them
often. Now I think that they are often a very bad idea. Not because of
security concerns, as one person once suggested to me, but because I
don’t want static methods/classes hanging round (increasing global
state) or I later realise more than one is needed!</p>

<p>Once when creating a consumer website for a bank I needed access to
various pieces of bank information at numerous points in the code.
“There is only one bank”, I reasoned and made the class containing this
information a singleton. Then the bank acquired another two banks so my
design was broken and refactoring had to take place right before launch.
However, despite learning repeatedly from experience, I still find
myself creating more. I think this is due to laziness on my part. If I’m
short of time or feel that it is not particularly important, I fall back
on habit. Later, while refactoring I realise a better result could have
been achieved with some thought. For instance, if the global access of
singletons is a problem, perhaps using an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">IoC</a> container (like
<a href="http://www.springsource.org/about">Spring</a>) to wire everything up could
help.</p>

<p>I hereby resolve not to use Singletons without thinking very hard first
about whether there is a better way.</p>

or at its

<p>This is a recording of a <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">University of California at
Berkeley</a> history course on the ancient
Mediterranean given by Professor Isabelle Pafford during Fall 2007.
There are 25 podcasts (each around one hour, and 15 MB) starting with a
couple on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>
and then passing through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">Ancient
Greece</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period">Hellenistic
Period</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman
Republic</a> before ending
with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire’s</a>
collapse in the west around the 5th century AD. Most attention is paid
to Greek and Roman history. A following course on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine">Byzantine</a> history is
mentioned, but I couldn’t find it online.</p>

<p>As should be expected for a series covering so much, the lectures often
quickly pass over topics. Some parts of lectures were lists of important
events. Despite this, there were more than enough digressions onto
engaging side-topics to maintain interest (for instance, there was a
passage on the nude in Greek sculpture and another on the formal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursus_honorum">political structure/progression in the Roman
Republic</a>). Thus the
podcasts serve as a good introduction to the breadth of ancient
Mediterranean civilisations and highlights areas you may want to explore
further (after this I was looking forward to learning more on the mid
and late Roman republic). I can’t find much fault with the content of
the course considering its scope.</p>

<p>I can find fault with the production standards, which overall are
frustratingly poor. The sound quality is often annoyingly bad. For one
lecture I had the volume turned up to max and pushed the earplugs deeper
into my ears and I still could barely hear the lecturer, who sounded
like she was mumbling next to a static noise generator. Course
administration comments are sometimes made during a lecture - including
asking unintentionally rhetorical questions to what seem to be largely
apathetic students. Considering these are lecture recordings I can
understand this, but usually the first few minutes of each lecture are
taken up with course administration too (these could have easily been
cut). Also, Professor Pafford regularly refers to visual aides that are
no longer available online (the bspace website mentioned in the podcasts
has been shutdown). Also the first two lectures are missing.</p>

<p>A good introduction to classical history, made slightly less pleasurable
by poor production.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>What is the accepted way to test generated source code? A recent work
project required me to generate some Java source code from small
definition files as part of a larger framework. The plan was for other
project teams to take the framework and use the generator to create
source which would become part of their project. I wanted to write unit
tests for the source code. The problem was how to write a test for code
that didn’t exist at the time the test was written because it hadn’t
been generated yet! I came up with a few options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do a text comparison between generated code and the previously
created known text output of the generation process. If they are
exactly the same, the test passes. This tests the generation process
if correct but doesn’t test the logic of the generated code. If the
generated code has syntactic errors, compilers or IDEs will pick
this up quite fast and the developers in the other project will
complain quickly, but subtle logic could go unchecked for ages.</li>
  <li>Write a test that generates a class file from known inputs then
compiles it programmactically with the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/tools/JavaCompiler.html">Java Compiler
API</a>
then loads the class into the JVM and runs tests against it. This
would be better than the previous idea, as it tests the
functionality of the result. This was my first choice solution.
However, getting the Java Compiler API to work can be a bit hard.
There was a paucity of documentation on this and in the end I
couldn’t get it to work within time constraints.</li>
  <li>Generate the test at the same time as the generated code and pass
them both to the other project. The other project would then test
the generated code as if it was their code. This felt wrong to me.
No other generations systems do this - it is like passing the buck.
If there is an error in the generated code then the generator needs
to be fixed not the generated class!</li>
  <li>A 2-step process - test the functionality and generation process
separately. First, create a class that should be the same as a
generated class given known inputs (probably by generating it!) and
write tests that work against that class. Thus the problem of
testing not yet existing code is solved by using some code generated
earlier. This tests the generated code’s functionality as long as
the generating process doesn’t change. So the second part is to test
the generation process hasn’t changed using the first test in this
list. Add another test to generate the code and check that it is
exactly the same text as the class the rest of the test is written
against. If the generation output changes then you have to modify
the pre-generated class, and thus change the functionality test if
required. Easy.</li>
</ul>
