    <p>Time for a pet peeve. Why do people say “scientists” as if they are some
homogeneous group? Nearly every morning I hear reporters say “scientists
have discovered that blah, blah, blah” during their token science story.
It seems to be a lazy way to avoid saying biologist, astronomer,
chemist, physicist, etc. Now I can’t claim to be a scientist of any
description (I dropped out of a PhD in Computer Science). Professionally
I’m more of an engineer nowadays (although that is another category
occasionally lumped into the media’s science bucket). However, I know a
few PhDs or lecturers in science subjects and there is a fairly large
difference between the things they do, so it’s not that hard to broadly
differentiate them into categories more specific than scientist. Asking
them is often a good start! Also, there is rarely a mention of where or
how the work was done. I personally would be more impressed by a
statistically significant result in a double blind study from MIT than a
report from the Pond’s Institute (although TV commercials would suggest
the Pond’s Institute has nicer labs).</p>

<p>Not convinced? Try this comparison. Next time you listen to the sport
section of the news replace any mention of a specific game with “sport”
and the players with “sports players”, then just remove any mention of
specific teams. “Last night in sport, a group of sports players from
Manchester beat 3-2 a bunch of sport players from London.” Not very
informative.</p>

    <p>Today I shut down my historical weather website. It continually broke
because BBC Backstage Weather kept changing the format of their RSS
feed. It became too much effort to maintain the site in a working state,
so it had to go. Since there was only ever 943 hits on it and the vast
majority of those were me, I don’t feel too bad. It served its purpose
and I learnt quite a bit from writing it. In any case, I should focus my
limited spare time on more useful projects.</p>

<p>I have kept weather_report up in case anyone wants to take it up and
use it, but they would have to fix it for the new RSS format first.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I have been thinking that software development is all about models and
events. By models I mean <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_model">domain
models</a>, and by events I’m
referring to an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_architecture">event-driven
architecture</a>.
Not quite the <a href="http://stuffinvestmentbankerslike.blogspot.com/2008/06/40-models-and-bottles.html">models and
bottles</a>
of Investment Banking.</p>

<p>The domain model is where the application’s data lives. It is the model
part of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">MVC</a>
pattern. For example, in a system that manipulates songs, a song would
be part of the domain model, together with the song’s name, artist,
album etc (in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-oriented</a>
systems there would be a song class containing these attributes). The
more time I spend coding, the more I find that the future course of a
project is directly related to how its domain model was conceived. Using
MVC, changing the model later can involve a great deal of work if the
model touches everything else. Thus usually some time is spent on
working out the model and refactoring it if necessary. Indeed, I
remember once describing a less than satisfying job as drawing pictures
all day, meaning
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML</a> mainly for
the domain (I would have preferred to be coding).</p>

<p>I have a few tips for domain models. Follow the ideal of MVC, that is
keep view and controller logic out of the model. Also, try to have <a href="http://blog.kineticweb.com/articles/2007/06/01/skinny-controller-fat-model">fat
models and skinny
controllers</a>
(this is a <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby On Rails</a> idea, but I find it
works well in general). Keep model classes immutable if possible.
Lastly, write your own containers (containing and hiding actual
SDK-based containers) for easy aggregation functions (and
parallelising). None of this is particularly controversial, few people I
have worked with would disagree.</p>

<p>What I have recently found surprising is that people do disagree with
using an event based architecture where I feel it would work well.
Event-driven systems are ones where changes to domain state are packaged
as events and passed to listeners of those events through some form of
callback. This helps promote a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loosely-coupled</a> design,
something else I would strongly encourage. Also recommended is keeping
the events at the lowest level appropriate in the model (a rule I’ve
broken a few times). For instance, if you have an album which contains
songs, a “songAdded” event would go on the album listeners, but a
“songUpdated” event should fire on the song’s listeners. Other people
seem to prefer a system of loops polling for changes (or something
similar). I find their code far more complicated. Event-driven systems
are simple to write, simple to understand and you only need to handle
the events you are interested in. I would be interested to hear what
other experienced programmers have found works.</p>

  <h4><a href="/blog/2009/10/java-enumerations-sometimes-co.html">Java Enumerations (Sometimes) Considered Harmful</a></h4> 
  Tags:

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>In a recent coding project I fell foul of Java enumerations. They seem
like a very good idea, and indeed they are when used properly. However,
there is sometimes a tendency to overuse them - something unfortunately
learnt from personal experience.</p>

<p>Intially Java had no inbuilt concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type">enumerated
types</a>. Developers often
found themselves inadequately simulating them by creating a bunch on
integer constants. Proper enumerations were added to Java in JDK1.5 with
the enum keyword and developers rejoiced (or at least I did). The
following example from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html">Java Language
Guide</a>
shows how they are used:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="nc">Rank</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="no">DEUCE</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">THREE</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">FOUR</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">FIVE</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">SIX</span><span class="o">,</span>
        <span class="no">SEVEN</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">EIGHT</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">NINE</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">TEN</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">JACK</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">QUEEN</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">KING</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">ACE</span> <span class="o">}</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="nc">Suit</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="no">CLUBS</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">DIAMONDS</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">HEARTS</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">SPADES</span> <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Actually, the above is just the basic usage pattern. Java enums can have
data and behavior, as shown in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Planet</code> example below (from the same
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html">guide</a>).
They can also implement abstract methods directly at the definition (see
the guide) but they cannot be subclassed.</p>

<p>I think the first (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Rank</code> &amp; <code class="highlighter-rouge">suit</code>) example is correct usage of enums -
essentially treating them as related constant values. In my opinion, the
second example is problematic. Here the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Planet</code> enum is acting
similarly to a class with each instance being like an object, with data
and associated behaviour. At the level of the example this may seem
acceptable - not much is happening here. However, code rarely stays
static. Requirements change and thus the code changes to handle
different functionality. It is not hard to imagine more data being
required for each <code class="highlighter-rouge">Planet</code>. Object-oriented classes are designed to help
handle this change. Enumerations are not and there is no inheritance,
nor is it possible to pass non static constructor arguments. As a
result, as the functionality of an enum becomes more “object-like”, the
code supporting it becomes increasingly messy.</p>

<p>The general rule is that linked constants should be enumerations, but
anything more than that should probably be a class.</p>

<p>I have broken this rule myself and lived to regret it. A project I
recently worked on aggregated a number of different financial markets
and presented a single interface for downstream clients. This project
used quite a few enumerations. For example, there were enums to define
the market defined type of a financial instrument and another for its
pricing method. These worked fine, they were mutually exclusive values
read from the markets essentially as constants. There was also an enum
for the markets themselves. At first this was fine, each market was
treated the same. However, as the system expanded to new markets and
extra functionality, differences between markets began to appear. More
and more logic began to hang off the market enum. Some was data stored
on the market enum. Most was determined by the environment and was set
by configuration settings. This logic ended up in various special
classes constructed by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">Factory</a> classes
switching on market. Indeed there was quite a bit of logic in the system
that switched code path depending on market. The code would definitely
have worked better had there been a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Market</code> class rather than
enumeration. Refactoring all the code to use a class rather than a
enumeration was a big job in an important working system.</p>
