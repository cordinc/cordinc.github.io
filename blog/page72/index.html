or at its

<p>This is a recording of a <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">University of California at
Berkeley</a> history course on the ancient
Mediterranean given by Professor Isabelle Pafford during Fall 2007.
There are 25 podcasts (each around one hour, and 15 MB) starting with a
couple on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Ancient Egypt</a>
and then passing through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">Ancient
Greece</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period">Hellenistic
Period</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman
Republic</a> before ending
with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman Empire’s</a>
collapse in the west around the 5th century AD. Most attention is paid
to Greek and Roman history. A following course on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine">Byzantine</a> history is
mentioned, but I couldn’t find it online.</p>

<p>As should be expected for a series covering so much, the lectures often
quickly pass over topics. Some parts of lectures were lists of important
events. Despite this, there were more than enough digressions onto
engaging side-topics to maintain interest (for instance, there was a
passage on the nude in Greek sculpture and another on the formal
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursus_honorum">political structure/progression in the Roman
Republic</a>). Thus the
podcasts serve as a good introduction to the breadth of ancient
Mediterranean civilisations and highlights areas you may want to explore
further (after this I was looking forward to learning more on the mid
and late Roman republic). I can’t find much fault with the content of
the course considering its scope.</p>

<p>I can find fault with the production standards, which overall are
frustratingly poor. The sound quality is often annoyingly bad. For one
lecture I had the volume turned up to max and pushed the earplugs deeper
into my ears and I still could barely hear the lecturer, who sounded
like she was mumbling next to a static noise generator. Course
administration comments are sometimes made during a lecture - including
asking unintentionally rhetorical questions to what seem to be largely
apathetic students. Considering these are lecture recordings I can
understand this, but usually the first few minutes of each lecture are
taken up with course administration too (these could have easily been
cut). Also, Professor Pafford regularly refers to visual aides that are
no longer available online (the bspace website mentioned in the podcasts
has been shutdown). Also the first two lectures are missing.</p>

<p>A good introduction to classical history, made slightly less pleasurable
by poor production.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>What is the accepted way to test generated source code? A recent work
project required me to generate some Java source code from small
definition files as part of a larger framework. The plan was for other
project teams to take the framework and use the generator to create
source which would become part of their project. I wanted to write unit
tests for the source code. The problem was how to write a test for code
that didn’t exist at the time the test was written because it hadn’t
been generated yet! I came up with a few options:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do a text comparison between generated code and the previously
created known text output of the generation process. If they are
exactly the same, the test passes. This tests the generation process
if correct but doesn’t test the logic of the generated code. If the
generated code has syntactic errors, compilers or IDEs will pick
this up quite fast and the developers in the other project will
complain quickly, but subtle logic could go unchecked for ages.</li>
  <li>Write a test that generates a class file from known inputs then
compiles it programmactically with the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/javax/tools/JavaCompiler.html">Java Compiler
API</a>
then loads the class into the JVM and runs tests against it. This
would be better than the previous idea, as it tests the
functionality of the result. This was my first choice solution.
However, getting the Java Compiler API to work can be a bit hard.
There was a paucity of documentation on this and in the end I
couldn’t get it to work within time constraints.</li>
  <li>Generate the test at the same time as the generated code and pass
them both to the other project. The other project would then test
the generated code as if it was their code. This felt wrong to me.
No other generations systems do this - it is like passing the buck.
If there is an error in the generated code then the generator needs
to be fixed not the generated class!</li>
  <li>A 2-step process - test the functionality and generation process
separately. First, create a class that should be the same as a
generated class given known inputs (probably by generating it!) and
write tests that work against that class. Thus the problem of
testing not yet existing code is solved by using some code generated
earlier. This tests the generated code’s functionality as long as
the generating process doesn’t change. So the second part is to test
the generation process hasn’t changed using the first test in this
list. Add another test to generate the code and check that it is
exactly the same text as the class the rest of the test is written
against. If the generation output changes then you have to modify
the pre-generated class, and thus change the functionality test if
required. Easy.</li>
</ul>

website</a>.</p>

<p>This complete university course (from Fall 2007) on Ancient Greek
History from <a href="http://www.yale.edu/">Yale</a> is the best history podcast I
have found so far. It consists of 24 lectures of about an hour’s length
each, all given by Professor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Kagan">Donald
Kagan</a>. It starts with an
introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece">Mycenaean
Greece</a> before moving
onto the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Dark_Ages">Greek Dark Ages</a>
and Homeric stories. The series ends with Philip of Macedon’s victory at
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chaeronea_%28338_BC%29">Battle of
Chaeronea</a>
and the Greek Polis’ permanent loss of independence. Along the way it
details all the major events including: the rise and strangeness of
Sparta; the rise of Athens and democracy; Persian wars; and the slow
decrease of power in the struggle for hegemony after the Peloponnesian
War. Only the 27 years of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War">Peloponnesian
War</a> seem to be under
represented in coverage (from my previous knowledge of history). Despite
4 lectures being dedicated to it in the syllabus, most of these are
taken by finishing prior topics and the buildup to the war. For the war
itself, Professor Kagan suggests looking to other sources as it it too
much to cover properly, and instead talks in detail about two related
topics - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles">Pericles’</a> strategy and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides">Thucydides’</a> history.</p>

<p>One thing I can’t fault is the production. The podcasts are professional
from start to finish. The only blemish is Professor Kagan’s occasional
coughing, but this is a minor issue. The podcasts are available in a
number of formats on the course website: audio-only (the same mp3s that
are on iTunes); video, in both high (around 700 MB) &amp; medium (around 250
MB) bandwith forms; and, complete text transcripts. The website also
includes the notes handed out with each lecture, although these
unfortunately are without the original images due to copyright problems.
The website itself is downloadable too (albeit with only links to the
audio and video files). While videos of the lectures are available, it
is not really necessary to download them as they mainly just show Kagan
talking at his podium. Rarely does he use any visual aid during the
lectures. Thus these are excellent podcasts to listen to audio-only -
very little will be missed.</p>

<p>The lectures are often a recitation of events together with discussion
of how and why things may have occurred that way (for instance a section
on various military strategies and whether they were correct). The aim
appears to be getting the listener into the mindset of the ancient Greek
statesmen (and thus the citystates in general). A goal largely achieved
to my mind. There is less discourse on daily life (but still some).
Professor Kagan also talks a little about historical controversies and
often compares ancient events to modern history (in particular around
the use of military force). In both situations he tends to declare his
own prejudices so the listener is not led too much.</p>

<p>This is a highly recommended lecture series - interesting content that
goes into the subject with some depth and so well produced it is
surprisingly easy listening.</p>

    <p>My mobile phone company recently gave me a two-for-one dinner voucher.
Most of the qualifying venues were high-end fast food chains, but
looking through the list I spotted a little gem - <a href="http://www.cafespice.co.uk/">Cafe Spice
Namaste</a>. I had heard a few things about
this Indian restaurant near Tower Bridge, so was keen to give it a try.
We went along on a Wednesday night and there were quite a few people
there, suggesting a booking would definitely be necessary on more
popular nights. The polite head waiter spent some time checking the
voucher as we were apparently the first people to use such a voucher
there. Once that was sorted out we ordered.</p>

<p>The menu was a little different to the standard Indian. For a start it
was much shorter, just a few dishes, rather than the numerous curry
combinations found elsewhere. We had poppadoms for starters followed by
lamb shank and spiced partridge with naan and a potato/cauliflower/pea
side dish. The food was very good. The poppadoms and chutneys were
noticeably nicer than other places. My lamb shank was beautifully cooked
and the slightly spiced sauce very more’ish - when I finished my plate
was clean. The off-the-bone partridge was equally good. The portions
were a good size and after that lot (plus some beer) we were too full
for dessert. Although seeing the Belgian chocolate icecream at the next
table tempted us, we did not waver and got the bill.</p>

<p>The service was very fast and efficient. It was more expensive than
other Indian places, but also far better. Although, it was by no means
expensive by general London standards, a little over £60 before the
voucher discount (and including service). For comparison, the next best
Indian restaurant I’ve been is
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/fancy-restaurants-part-deux.html">Babur</a>.
Without a discount Cafe Spice Namaste is a little more expensive than
Babur, but with better food (thanks to the poppadoms) and easily better
service. This is definitely a place I’ll be visiting again.</p>

    <p>If you go to my <a href="http://www.cordinc.com">main website</a>, you will now
find it changed. Previously it was a basic advert for my professional
services. However, the company I ran those services through will be
shutting down soon. So the site is now a hook upon which to place my
little side projects. Thus I have added a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blender">Blender
