    <p>A year has again quickly passed and it is time to assess the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/01/goals-1.html">goals I
set last year</a> and
decide what I want to achieve in the coming year. Last year I said I
would:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Result:
achieved.</strong> 43 blog posts in 12 months.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete the game demo and send it out for comments. Result:
achieved.</strong> I completed a prototype of <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games/#ConcealedIntent">Concealed
Intent</a>
around mid-year and had some positive feedback. I then started on
the proper game and sent out an early build to a friend - more
positive feedback with some constructive criticism. I’m confident
enough in the idea that I will continue.</li>
  <li><strong>Be able to run. Result: achieved.</strong> I can run for about 10 minutes
(at a slow speed) with no complaint by my feet or ankles the next
day. It’s not much, but it’s a definite improvement. My feet are not
100%, they sometimes feel a bit tight, but I haven’t had any pain
for months.</li>
  <li><strong>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: achieved
(just).</strong> I got rid of all my DVDs, some books, old clothes and many
unnecessary papers (e.g. 9 year old bank statements). On the other
side of the ledger I acquired a laptop. I know that everything I own
now fits in around 11 packing boxes and two suitcases. It will be
hard to make further decreases without getting rid of my books, CDs
or desktop PC.</li>
  <li><strong>Leave the UK. Result: achieved.</strong> I now live in <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/12/kuala-lumpur-1.html">Kuala
Lumpur</a> and
plan to be here for the next 4 years. After 6 weeks, I like it here.
I don’t think enjoyment of life will be a problem, but I just need
to be mindful of my career for when it comes time to leave.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain general Blender, Ruby and Scala skills. Result:
partial.</strong> I have barely touched Blender and haven’t used Ruby at
all. However, my Scala skills were improved by the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Functional
Programming course from
Coursera</a>.
There is talk of a follow-on course teaching more advanced concepts
in Scala - I look forward to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a bad track record. I think it helps to just focus on a few things
rather than trying to achieve too much. For the coming year, I will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level. I want
to complete the game to at least public beta where it just requires
some fine-tuning and bug-fixing. The aim is to sell the finished
game and at least break even. Thus I will continuously promote the
game through the year, to build awareness. I will aim to build a
community as early as possible. Especially for the purposes of
gaining feedback (to this end I hope to soon’ish produce an alpha
build with a wider testing audience). Starting soon, I hope to
produce nearly weekly updates on progress at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/">Jarrah
Technology</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that is it! Well no, there are a couple more, but Concealed Intent
is going to be such a focus over the coming year, it deserves a list to
itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Never more than
4 a month. The level of effort required to maintain this blog over
the last year seems about right to me. Many of the technical posts
will probably migrate to the Jarrah Technology blog, so this will
become largely memories, travels and general thoughts.</li>
  <li>Exercise 3 times a week. For the first time in 6 years, I have both
the time to exercise and I’m injury-free. While my first priority is
to stay injury-free, I also want to become fit again, rather than
being puffed after just a slow 10min run.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I have succumbed to a fad - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk">the standing
desk</a>. Now that I have moved
countries and needed to set up my working environment again, I though
I’d try standing rather than sitting. After injuring my foot nearly two
years ago now, I have found that after sitting a desk for several hours
(as I tend to do when concentrating hard) the injury gets worse. Only
very regular stretching and walking compensates for the sitting I do as
part of the normal working day. Moving into our new flat, I found a
couple of small bedside tables that were the perfect height for setting
up a standing arrangement.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/standing_desk.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a week of standing, it now feels comfortable. At first my heels
would ache and my foot seemed tense. I think this was due to me standing
with locked knees and having all my weight run down through my heels.
Now I lean a little forward and take most weight through the pads of my
feet (just behind the toes). Rolling my feet on a tennis ball
occasionally also helps. I also find it easier to jiggle around and
move, rather than stay completely stationary. There is less impedance to
moving around. I can’t say my foot is any better, but neither is it any
worse. In any case the standing makes me more mobile and less stiff, so
I will continue using it for now.</p>

    <p>The end is near. No not the end of this blog. The end of my time in
London. In a couple of days I will be on a plane to South-East Asia.
Most of the luggage has already left. I’m in that weird disconnected
in-between state where I’m not sure what I should be doing. In any case,
this blog may be neglected for the next couple of weeks as I complete
the move and discover first-hand how good Internet access is in
Malaysia. I have heard it is very good and hope to be back soon. Until
then, goodbye.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Britain has two postal systems. The main one is the well known <a href="http://www.royalmail.com">Royal
Mail</a>. The vast majority of mail goes through
this system and uses the standard UK postcode system. If you have sent
mail to or from Britain, this is almost certainly the system you have
used. The other system is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Forces_Post_Office">British Forces Post Office
(BFPO)</a>. It is
for sending post to British Forces abroad. Technically this means it
predates the Royal Mail, as the first English postal system was set up
for English soldiers in Scotland or France. The idea is that you send
mail to the BFPO address in Britain and then the government will ensure
it reaches the appropriate person around the world without handing it
over to anyone outside the British government. Normally this means the
military delivers it, but it can also go through diplomatic or foreign
office channels.</p>

<p>BFPO address look quite different to Royal Mail address. They just have
the addressee’s name, their id code and the BFPO Code. Sometimes a
postcode is appended for getting through some mail systems, <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ha4+6ep">HA4
6EP</a> - check it out. For
example BFPO 792 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bastion">Camp
Bastion</a> in Afghanistan, BFPO
305 is the navy ship
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Illustrious_(R06)">HMS
Illustrious</a> and BFPO 5439 is the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.
That last one is my new address and thus I have discovered the great
problem with BFPO addresses. Very few people seem to know how they work.
To all UK (and to a lesser extent, worldwide) web developers, there is
more than one UK post system - please handle it! In particular, pooks to
you HSBC - I expected better from an “international” bank.</p>
