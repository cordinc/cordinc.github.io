    <p>In July last year I opened a <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding
Circle</a> account. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-to-person_lending">P2P
lending</a> site
where people can lend money to British businesses. The idea is that a
business asks for a loan along with company details and usually a
director guarantee (so the director is personally responsible if the
company defaults). The site’s members then participate in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_auction">reverse
auction</a> to fund part of
the loan in amounts down to £20. Funding Circle advertise that their
members receive a 8.5% gross return on average. Below are notes on my
experience of the site.</p>

    <p>Available from
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/maya-weekend/id443941013">iTunes</a>
with the video podcasts also on
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pennmuseum/videos?query=maya">YouTube</a></p>

<p>In 2011 <a href="http://www.penn.museum/">Penn Museum</a> hosted a weekend academic
conference on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization">Maya
civilization</a>. This
series consists of recordings from that conference; each podcast is a
single presentation. The topics covered focus on Mayan women and
archaeological techniques (lots of discussion of research from doctoral
dissertations). There are eleven episodes all around 30-40 minutes in
length. Five are videos of presentations (so that the presenter and
their slides are visible), but the remainder are audio-only recordings.
Production quality is generally good, although the videos do
occasionally go out of focus. The talks are quite academic and dry. I
found it hard to follow sometimes, perhaps because I don’t have enough
background in Mayan history to hang the new facts upon. This series is
probably best for people who already have a knowledge of Mayan history.</p>

<p>The five video presentations all look at aspects of modern archaeology
technique. One looks at remote sensing - the process of using photos or
data from planes and satellites to identity large ancient sites (usually
because the vegetation growing over ruins is somehow different to
normal). Another presentation takes the complete opposite approach and
details pedestrian surveys. This is as it sounds - walking around and
recording what is seen, not as easy as it sounds in a jungle. This talk
provided some interesting details on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunchucmil">Chunchucmil</a>, a town much
larger than local agriculture could support so trading must have
occurred. One presentation looks at what can be discovered from skeletal
remains. This is not just looking at the wear and tear on the body, but
also analysing isotopes in the bones. In this manner the researcher
discovered about a quarter of people at one site emigrated from their
childhood areas. Another researcher analysed pollen samples found in
lake sediment to determine historical ecology. They found that the
highest levels of deforestation occurred soon after agriculture began.
It seems these first farmers didn’t know the limits of the land. At the
time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Maya_collapse">Mayan
collapse</a> forest
levels were fairly balanced, opposing some theories suggesting that
deforestation was the cause. Instead, evidence was found for drought
around this time, boosting an opposing theory. The last video
presentation promotes a new <a href="http://mayaarch3d.unm.edu/">repository of 3D measurements and models of
Mayan sites</a>.</p>

<p>Without the aid of visuals many of the audio-only podcasts are very dry
and hard to follow. Some becoming just recitations of events in Mayan
history. All but one of the audio presentation look at the position of
women in Mayan culture (the other concerned with inter-city interaction
and trade). Some notable facts include that at least three women rose to
become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajaw">Ajaws</a> (rulers of their city)
and that childbirth was considered equivalent of going to war.</p>

    <p>A cool little feature of Unity3D scripting I recently found is using
conditional compilation for debug statements. The C based languages (but
not Java unfortuately) have inbuilt preprocessors that allow developers
to only compile certain parts of the code if certain parameters are set
(it can also do much more, including macros). Thus you could write the
below and the code would only be included in the executable if <code class="highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code>
is defined.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="err">#</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">DEBUG</span>
    <span class="c1">// do some special code</span>
<span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">endif</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Unity3D has a similar system. Mostly the docs (<a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/Platform%20Dependent%20Compilation.html">available
here</a>)
seem to suggest this is for specialist code for different platforms:
iPhone, Web, PC, etc. Thus the defined parameters are set in advance
(e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">UNITY_IPHONE</code>). However, there is one that is useful for
debugging, <code class="highlighter-rouge">UNITY_EDITOR</code>. This will only be set if the application is
running inside the Unity3D GUI. Once you build the app those lines of
code will be skipped. It can be used like the below example - very
handy.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="err">#</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">UNITY_EDITOR</span>
    <span class="nx">Debug</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Debugging</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">endif</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>According to <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/71445-How-To-Set-Project-Wide-pragma-Directives-with-JavaScript">this Unity3D forum
post</a>
it is also possible to define your own project specific preprocessor
parameters.</p>

  Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Technical.html">Technical</a>, 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Unity.html">Unity</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I have been programming mainly in <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> over
the last fortnight, and thought it time to write some unit tests for my
work. I found reference to a <a href="http://unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Unit_Test_Framework">few testing frameworks
online</a>.
The most promising appeared to be
<a href="http://www.unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=SharpUnit">SharpUnit</a>,
and it is also released under a fairly relaxed license. However, I had
to make a few changed to get it running, so this post details that work.</p>

<p>SharpUnit works like a standard unit testing framework for C# code in
Unity3D (although all output goes to the console, but that is fine for
me). Although my work has largely been in UnityScript (Unity3D’s
JavaScript like language) and this didn’t work so well due to issues
with compilation order and SharpUnit’s use of .Net custom attributes.
After making the changes below, I found SharpUnit works well, and I’ll
probably be using it for my unit testing.</p>

<p>Unity3D compiles scripts in a set order (<a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/index.Script_compilation_28Advanced29.html">as described
here</a>).
Thus if you have C# code that references a UnityScript class there can
be a problem - although the reverse is not such an issue. When testing
UnityScript with SharpUnit this means that the C# <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unity3D_TestRunner</code>
class can be an issue. It references the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestCase</code> classes, which I
want to write in UnityScript. To do this I put the SharpUnit code in a
folder under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plugins</code> top-level folder (the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Standard Assets</code>
folder would have also worked). This means the SharpUnit code is
compiled first. Then my tests went in a new folder together with a
UnityScript rewrite of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unity3D_TestRunner</code>, as shown below. This
UnityScript TestRunner script is then attached to the TestRunner
GameObject (in a special testing scene) rather than the C# version as
described in the SharpUnit instructions.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">pragma</span> <span class="nx">strict</span>

<span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">SharpUnit</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Start</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">suite</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">TestSuite</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">TestSuite</span><span class="p">();</span>
	<span class="nx">suite</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">AddAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">DummyTest</span><span class="p">());</span>
	<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">TestResult</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">suite</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">reporter</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">Unity3D_TestReporter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Unity3D_TestReporter</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="nx">reporter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">LogResults</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Other possible solutions to this problem would be to just write my code
in C# or to change SharpUnit to load <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestCase</code> classes dynamically at
runtime. Rewriting the TestRunner seemed easiest.</p>

<p>The other problem encountered is that SharpUnit uses the C# custom
attribute <code class="highlighter-rouge">[UnitTest]</code> to identify its test methods. The equivalent in
UnityScript is a script directive (see <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/12911/what-are-the-syntax-differences-in-c-and-javascrip.html">the relevant section
here</a>).
Thus <code class="highlighter-rouge">@UnitTest</code> needs to be placed at the top of each test function.</p>

<p>After that change I could run UnityScript tests with SharpUnit. An
example test is below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">pragma</span> <span class="nx">strict</span>

<span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">SharpUnit</span><span class="p">;</span>

    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">dummy</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">String</span><span class="p">;</span>  

    <span class="cm">/** Setup test resources, called before each test. */</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">SetUp</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">TearDown</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">dummy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">;</span> 
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="cm">/** Sample test that passes */</span>
    <span class="p">@</span><span class="nd">UnitTest</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">TestDummy_Pass</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
