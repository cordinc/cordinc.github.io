    <p>Back in May I decided it was time to learn to play golf. Since then I
have been to a golf school, 2 golf courses, a driving range and an
indoor video golf centre. I thought I would write briefly about them.</p>

<p><strong>The James Andrews School Of Golf</strong></p>

<p>I signed up for a 3 day residential training course with <a href="http://golfschool.co.uk/">The James
Andrews School Of Golf</a> as a holiday. I
greatly enjoyed the break. Although I can’t claim to be a good golfer at
the moment, I can say that I am a better golfer as a result of the
course as I saw my swing improve over the 3 days (considering I
consistently missed the ball entirely at the start). Indeed most of the
course focussed on the swing. The general format was swing practice,
putting/pitching practice, and then the swing again before lunch and
having the afternoon to ourselves. Nice course, good teacher, highly
recommended (although the food could have been better considering the
cost). I certainly left feeling prepared to tackle a proper course.</p>

<p><strong>World Of Golf</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately it took a while before I managed to get myself onto a
proper golf course, so in the interim I kept up my driving skills with a
couple of visits to <a href="http://www.worldofgolf-uk.co.uk/driving+ranges/sidcup">World Of
Golf</a>, a local
driving range. I never had to queue for a bay, itis £7 for 100 balls and
you can hire clubs, not much more to say. I still go regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Hobbs Cross Golf Course</strong></p>

<p>My first proper game of golf was at <a href="http://www.hobbscrossgolfcentre.com/">Hobbs
Cross</a>. in Essex. It seemed like a
friendly course, geared towards beginners. There was a 9-hole par-3 and
another more normal 9-hole. For the record I was 57-over for the full</p>
<ol>
  <li>There was a driving range, but the cafe was closed - take your own
food just in case. A good course and I’ll go back eventually (it’s a
good distance away from where I live).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Beckenham Place Park Golf Course</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.glendale-golf.com/course-7-beckenham-place.aspx">Beckenham Place
Park</a> is
probably the nearest course to my current abode. It is a cheap public
course (£50 for 2 and club hire), and is a bit harder than Hobbs Cross.
Aside from the golf, I was not greatly impressed: the hire clubs seemed
poor to me; the cafe was disappointing (salad in sandwiches is
apparently not often requested); there were many groups of kids
wandering around and the toilets were closed. On the golf side, quite a
few of the holes are uphill which causes me some problems. I’m in no
rush to return.</p>

<p><strong>City Golf</strong></p>

<p>I was given a voucher for a complimentary session at <a href="http://www.citygolfclubs.com/">City
Golf</a>, where you play golf inside,
hitting your balls towards a video screen. While this was ok for driving
practice, nothing else played as I would expect it. Putting was hopeless
and so was trying to get out of the rough - there was just no feel.
Although it was free to me, the costs seemed quite high. I doubt I am
their target market. I can’t imagine I’ll be going back anytime soon.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Yesterday was the second Poker evening I have organised. This time the
turnout was a little smaller: me, Ann, Amanda and Ury. Like last time we
played two Texas Hold’em tournaments, but the structure was a little
different. As Amanda was a complete beginner we decided to split into
pairs for heads-up tournaments for the first game. A decision with which
I was happy as this is what I mainly play during my occasional forays
online. Ury and I played each other, while Ann and Amanda went over the
basics. The second game was all four of us. Below are the games as I
remember them.</p>

<p>In the first game, I had the best of the early exchanges and built a
decent lead. Then came a hand where I had K5o; as the small blind I
3-bet and Ury called. The flop came K54o, Ury made a small bet, I went
all-in and Ury called. I was confident when he turned over K9, but when
the 9 came on the river I went from a bit ahead to way behind. I brought
myself back to par over the next 4 hands, with 3 all-in semi-bluffs (ace
high or a Q-high flush draw after the flop). Ury called me on one, my A3
caught trip 3s. The game went on as Ury slowly lost ground with poor
initial hands until forced in by the rising blinds on 10-8s (he said
that was the best starting hand he had since my run of semi-bluffs), but
beaten by my A2o with a pair of 2s. In all we played an hour and a half
with only 4 showdowns.</p>

<p>The main game started in a similar manner to the heads-up games; big
bets winning the pot without showdowns. At this point I seemed to get a
reputation as a bluffer judging by the table banter. So to answer Ury’s
question after pushing him off a pot with an all spade 9,10,J flop - I
had Q7, and open-ended straight draw with an overcard, not a complete
bluff. Ann was then so sure I was bluffing when there was a possible
straight on the board, she went all-in against me with the comment “I
know what you are pretending to have.” Ann then became the first rebuy
in our home games. The action came quickly after that. Ann busted Ury
and he bought in again right on the time limit. Amanda lost a couple of
big hands and was forced to go all-in. Ury and I joined the pot, which I
started betting big after the flop with an overcard, open-ended straight
and flush draw. Ury “ummed and ahhed”, complaining that we should do
just enough to bust Amanda, but finally called. Sensing weakness, I
continued to bet big and Ury agonised over the call. Then I went all-in
and Ury took an age to call, but finally won with two-pair against my
pair of kings. I was crippled with barely a big blind, and I was the big
blind! Without looking at my cards I went all-in 4 times in a row. Then
it was just Ann and Ury to finish. They seemed to get a little bored and
soon were all-in. Ury won on the better starting hand.</p>

<p>Again this was a lot of fun. I thought the small group may be a problem,
but it worked out very well. Also, changing the format of the games is
something worth trying again.</p>

    <p>Last weekend I finally saw the Tour de France live. I’m a fan of cycling
and have been to the Track World Championships, but never to the Tour.
Generally I find road racing uninteresting live - you wait around for
ages and then they go past very quickly. I made an exception for the
Tour since it is the biggest road race and there could be a good
atmosphere.</p>

<p>We arrived at Issy, a suburb of Paris, around 1pm. The tour was
scheduled to pass between 3pm &amp; 3:30pm on their way to the
Champs-Élysées. The hope was that this would avoid the crowds. A fair
assumption since the roads were deserted apart from the police. Settling
at a road side bar with a few drinks we waited. After an hour the crowds
started to build and cars began to pass us more often. Then came the
Tour caravan - a collection of advertising vehicles resembling parade
floats. I don’t have any photos of this as the crowds were 3 deep
(larger than for the cyclists!) and were desperately scrambling for the
trinkets thrown from the passing cars. We largely stayed in our seats.</p>

<p>By around 2:45pm the caravan had passed and the peloton was scheduled to
arrive soon after. Only they didn’t. The schedule was based on an
average speed of 38km/h, but the riders were obviously going much slower
and arrived around 4:30pm. It was a pleasant afternoon. I’m glad I went
and especially glad I didn’t go to the crowded end of the stage. I’d
recommend seeing it once, but I don’t feel any need to go again. Road
cycling is definitely a TV sport.</p>

<p>Below is a video of the peloton passing us. The winner Sastre (in the
yellow jersey) is in about 5th place, but there is clearly not much
racing going on. The overall results had been largely decided by this
point.</p>

    <p>On Thursday I went to the <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/07/11/techcrunch-pitch-mini-wrap-up/">London Techcrunch Pitch!
Event</a>.
Not as a competitor - I just wanted to get an idea of the standard of
technology startups in London. I now know the standard is surprisingly
high and I have a lot of work to do if I decide to try joining them.</p>

<p>The format was first a series of 30 second pitches by firms that didn’t
quite make the grade for the later 5 minute talks - about eight of each.
Afterwards there was a vote by the audience for who was the best. My
vote went to <a href="http://www.tioti.com/">TIOTI</a> who were probably the only
one who had a product I would consider using. Although it was very close
with a few others including the winner
<a href="http://www.watzatsong.com/">WatZatSong</a> who had a good idea and a very
slick presentation. Only one of the talks I would consider bad (poor
idea and poor presentation), everyone else was good and some were very
impressive. In general the 5 minute talks were a lot better than the 30
second ones, perhaps because the longer talks were given to the more
promising firms, or perhaps because 30 seconds is a very short time to
get a point across.</p>

<p>The competition seemed to be open to firms looking for funding, from
£150K up to a few million. None required seed funding. Many were up to
their second round of proper funding. I think all had launched and some
had significant revenues. In short they all seemed at the mature end of
the startup range. Indeed there was a high incidence of grey hairs among
the presenters.</p>

<p>Many of the people there seemed to know each other (or at least they
went with friends). Before, after and sometimes during the talks, groups
were talking to each other. At times I felt like a tourist, which
strictly speaking I suppose I was. If I decide to become serious about
this startup thing then I have a lot further to go, both on the
networking side and the actual project side.</p>
