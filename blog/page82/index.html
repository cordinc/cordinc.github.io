    <p>I recently had a problem with a service for which I paid a monthly fee.
My faith in the providing firm’s ability to provide the service was
destroyed. I cancelled the service and thought about adding the firm to
my list. “What list?” I hear you ask. The list of companies of which I
have been a paying customer, but will never be a customer again. In the
end I decided not to add them, they were helpful is sorting things out
and cancelling the service. Plus, they have other services I would still
consider.</p>

<p>In any case I thought it would be good to display my list. I won’t add
links or describe the circumstances of them being added. I don’t want to
provide free advertising, nor fall foul of British libel laws.</p>

<p><strong>Companies of which I have been a paying customer, but will never be a
customer again</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Hurford Salvi Carr Real Estate</li>
  <li>Kempton Azzopardi Real Estate</li>
  <li>Rossen Real Estate</li>
  <li>3 sixty Contractor Solutions</li>
  <li>British Gas</li>
  <li>Holmes Place Gyms (now Virgin Gyms)</li>
</ul>

<p>Just to show I’m not always gloomy, I’ll write another post with the

  <div class="content">
    <p>Five hardy souls braved the hail to attend the 4th Poker evening held
last Saturday in the salubrious surroundings of a Fitzrovia public
house. Ann, Pete, Christian, Amanda and I met for the now standard 2
Hold’em tournaments. Congratulations Amanda for being the big winner on
the day, with Christian just edging out myself in the winnings list.</p>

<p>The first game started slow with few big hands, small bets and a great
deal of bluffing (at least from myself). At one point my bad dealing
allowed some people to see that one of Pete’s pre-flop cards was a jack.
He decided to keep it and displayed it for all to see. When the flop was
jack-high, everyone folded except Ann. When another jack came on the
turn, the bets got bigger and the quips began “Ann, do you think he’s
bluffing”? In the end Ann’s J10 was better than Pete’s J6. As soon as
the half hour mark was reached and the blinds increased the game became
much looser. Amanda was out first, then Ann tried to catch my bluff with
KQs against my heavy betting, but I wasn’t bluffing with QQ. Soon Pete
was out and it was Christian and I, man-to-man. However, Christian’s
luck ran out shoving against my A10 with his pocket pair. It was all
over in under an hour.</p>

<p>The second match began with a furious pace. Early on Pete and I were
quite aggressive and on a couple of occasions got caught in bluffs (I
did and it looked like Pete did too). Myself, Amanda and Pete went out
in the first 30 minutes and rebought. I was out again soon after, going
all-in on the flop with a mid-pair and flush draw. Ann was again sure I
was bluffing, and considering my roughly 35% change of getting the flush
she wasn’t too far off. Later Pete pushed preflop and most of the table
folded. As two 4’s came on the flush Ann was visibly disappointed - she
had folded the other two 4’s. The commiserations didn’t last long as in
the next hand Pete’s AKs was beaten by Amanda who had four 5’s! With
Pete and myself out it looked like the game may settle down as the next
few hands were quite passively played. However, Amanda soon took up the
mantle of aggression with relish, building a stack that would win any
game of <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/">desktop defense</a>. With
consistent betting she gave no clues to her hands. At one point Amanda
with 27o (the worst possible hand) matched big pre-flop bets against Ann
with JJ. When the flop and turn came with two 7’s and not much else,
Amanda bet big and Ann again tried to catch a bluff. Thus, a very small
stack Christian played Amanda heads-up. Amanda continued to push every
hand (“poker is easy when you have such a big stack”) and Christian was
soon left as the big blind with only a small blind stack. With Christian
all-in just to make the blinds, the hole cards were dealt face-up - his
AA won the smallest possible pot! Christian’s luck came too late and the
game was over on the next hand - Amanda was the winner.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last year I started this by stating I wanted to write a system, put it
up online and create a startup around it. Well, 2 out of 3 isn’t bad.
I’d still like to create a product business, but I’m fairly happy I got
Queuesaurus up and running. I partially attribute this result to
publishing the goal So I thought I’d write a new list.</p>

<p>Achievable goals (I hope to manage most of these):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve Ruby skills to general professional standard (at present I
know it just well enough to do what I want), particularly:
    <ul>
      <li>Gemify BBC weather component and put it on
<a href="http://github.com/">github</a></li>
      <li>Continue working on <a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queuesaurus</a>
issue list (now kept on queuesaurus - viva dogfooding!)</li>
      <li>Start next web project</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> to point of being able to
rewrite one of my old abandoned libraries in it</li>
  <li>Learn <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to point of being able to
recreate simple ancient historical architectural scenes (no need for
animation or people)</li>
  <li>Decrease net ownership of physical goods</li>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 4 times a month</li>
  <li>Run 5km in 25 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>Stretch goals (I’m unlikely to manage any of these without significantly
more spare time):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the <a href="http://www.cordinc.info/weather">weather app</a> to a standard
where I would be happy to open source it (no one would use it, but
it could show what I can do)</li>
  <li>learn Blender and gaming libraries enough to create simplistic
graphical MMOs</li>
  <li>Restart abandoned libraries (graph data type, yafal, music library
analyser)</li>
  <li>Play poker profitably</li>
  <li>Make enough money from non-consulting activities to cover costs</li>
</ul>

    <p>I have completed another 50 online HU poker SnGs. At least I am
consistent - I won 26, the same as the last 50. Again, despite winning
more games than I lose, I have less money than when I started due to
fees (27.5 games is the breakeven point). Also like the previous 50s, I
experienced great runs. I won 14 of the first 18 games. Which of course
means that I won only 12 of the last 32. Urrrgh. I have read that the
variance in HU SnGs is higher than other kinds of poker, but results
like that still really knock your confidence. Worst of all I kept some
stats and discovered the average game runs around 15 minutes. That
quickly adds up and is preventing me doing other things.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to take this poker thing a little less seriously. I’m not
going to quit, but neither am I going to keep track of results and
actively try to play more. I still have some money in my online account,
and will play with that if I feel like it. However, I don’t think I have
the time to continue playing at a rate high enough to get much better
right now. Just standing still for a while will be good enough. I’m not
yet sure what I will do if I run my account down to 0. So for the
foreseeable future there will be no more online poker updates.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A few years ago I had the idea of creating a fairly standard online
spaceship combat game (like <a href="http://www.eveonline.com">EVE</a>). The
difference to other such games being that the players would not control
their ships directly, but instead through code they submitted to the
game - a more complicated and extended
<a href="http://robocode.sourceforge.net/">Robocode</a> or
<a href="http://www.corewars.org/">CoreWar</a>. At the time I stopped because I
couldn’t work out a way of preventing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Denial of service
attacks</a> in the
submitted code. I had hoped to use Java as it had an extensive security
model, but I found there was no way of stopping untrusted code from
starting too many threads or allocating too much memory.</p>

<p>Fast forward many years, and I thought I’d check out if the situation
has improved. A search on Google returned all the same webpages I read 9
years ago - there hasn’t been much movement in the area. The Javadocs
suggested that the thread issue had been fixed, but no word about
memory. I checked Robocode and it seems to just ignore the memory
allocation problem. This is because it is not fixed!</p>

<p>WTF! Sun has gone on about the <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Security/whitepaper/JS_White_Paper.pdf">Java Security
Model</a>
for some time now. Touting the safety of its sandbox. However, if
untrusted code can crash the system it is broken - nothing more to say.
I don’t care about the rest. This has been a known issue for years.</p>

<p>Anyway, rant over. On a more positive side, I used
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> for the first time in
researching this issue and it is quite cool. My question is
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/540738/excessive-memory-allocation-in-java-sandbox-security">here</a>.
The answer states that there is a <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=284">movement to fix the memory DoS
attack</a>, but that it is still in
the requirements stage and <a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/java7/">probably will not be part of
Java7</a>.</p>
