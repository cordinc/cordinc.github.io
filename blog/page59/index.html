    <p>I read articles on the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/8-habits-of-highly-effective-google-managers-2011-3">Habits Of Highly Effective Google
Managers</a>
with some interest. Empowering, coaching, communicating - sounds like
they want classic “Down” managers. Down managers are those who focus on
the employees working for them. I have had a few good Down managers and
they create a great working environment (and often a sense of loyalty).
Google apparently focuses on retaining employees and keeping them happy,
but is this all that is required? In any large organisation, politics
plays a major role, especially with setting priorities and allocating
budgets. This is the realm of the “Up” manager. Up managers focus on the
people above them in the management hierarchy and navigate company
bureaucracy. A good Up manager will ensure their projects get
recognition and resources.</p>

<p>Many developers lack respect for Up managers. When starting my career, I
considered them parasites more interested in their own success than the
success of the team. However, after being caught in the crossfire of
senior management politics a few times with no Up manager for
protection, I now think they are vital. At one investment bank, I was in
a very successful development team with a good Down person as team
leader and an Up person as team manager. I didn’t think we needed the
manager and then he left. Problems immediately began to trickle down
from up the hierarchy. It seems various senior managers wanted our
responsibilities and budget, some managers I had never heard about
before even claimed our success as their own. For two years, our old Up
manager had kept them all at bay. With him gone the team was torn apart
within months and I left (along with most of the team). Similar events
have occurred at two other employers.</p>

<p>The best management combines both Up and Down styles. Unfortunately this
combination is rarely found with any competence in one person. People
seem to naturally gravitate to one style of management or the other
based on personal preference or ability. Trying to do both normally ends
up in both being done badly. I have seen many try (usually under duress
or desperate circumstances), but only one succeed. More realistically
two managers working in conjunction is best - one Up and one Down. That,
or work in an organisation so small there is no up to manage!</p>

    <p>I quit my PhD studies and gave up the associated scholarship at the
start of September 1997. I needed to find a job fast and I wasn’t sure
how to go about getting one. A friend suggested some agents and I was
soon interviewing at various places. The first couple of interviews went
badly (including the agent sending me to one for which I was completely
unqualified - at least it was short). I began to calculate how long I
could cover my rent before resorting to selling stuff. Then in late
October I found myself talking to Alain at the agent’s offices. It was
supposed to be a proper interview, but Alain’s company didn’t have any
offices and it was more a friendly chat than the interrogations to which
I was now accustomed. He offered me a 3 month contract starting a couple
of weeks later. I accepted.</p>

    <p>When news of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Sendai_earthquake">last week’s earthquake in
Japan</a> first broke,
the details and images were largely provided by Japanese media sources.
After a couple of days this changed - the UK media had arrived! These
newsreaders added nothing to the coverage. They stood in front of
devastation and read the news, as opposed to sitting in a London studio
and reading the news. They are just talking heads, what difference does
it make where they are physically. The same goes for reporters
parachuted in to Japan (I hesitate to call them journalists considering
their output so far). One reporter after being asked how hard it would
be to evacuate, said he had no idea, he had only been in the country a
few hours. Why did he bother? The UK media people just seem to be adding
“colour” and making comments on ethnic stereotypes (“aren’t the Japanese
calm and stoic”).</p>

<p>Why does this disaster migration occur? Is it delusion, that the
UK-based reporters can provide a better new service if they are there?
Perhaps it is self-importance, that an important story requires
important newsreaders to give it weight? Alternatively: a junket;
profile building; to give an air of authority; or, to provide a more
interesting slant to a downbeat story? They add nothing and must
subtract a great deal. I can only imagine they are in the way of the
rescue effort for a start, and consuming resources (water, food,
housing, power, etc) that could be more charitably utilised.</p>

<p>All the major news programs in the UK seem to be doing this type of
reportage - Channel 4 have at least 3 unproductive reporters in Japan
right now (not including their production teams). They must have racked
up the frequent flyer points after arriving fresh from Libya and Egypt.
Perhaps the reason the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12702130">growing crisis in the Ivory
Coast</a> is being largely
ignored is because the reporters can’t get visas. This travel can come
across as hypocritical. Jon Snow took a trip to Brazil for reports on
global warming in advance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">Copenhagen climate
summit</a>
(he was heading in the wrong direction for a start). While there I
didn’t see him do anything that couldn’t have been done by a local
reporter. Back in Europe the next week for the summit itself, his
reports noted the increasing evidence that flying is becoming a notable
cause of global warming - like sending a news crew half way around the
world for no good reason!</p>

<p>Am I missing something? I can’t believe that the audience need this
travel to occur to be interested in stories of disaster or revolution.
It just seems pointless and ego-boosting.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Available on
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=387973532">iTunes</a>
and <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulearn/arts-and-humanities/podcast-a330-nemi">OU
Podcasts</a></p>

<p>These podcasts were produced as part of <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open
University</a> course <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a330.htm">A330: Myth in the Greek and
Roman
Worlds</a>.
However, it just concentrates on a single example, the artifacts found
at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Nemorensis">Temple of Diana at
Nemi</a>, popular in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Ancient Rome</a>. The series is
composed of 8 episodes, although only 4 of these are on the temple. The
remainder are introductions or discussions on context. The 4 temple
podcasts are video slideshows of photos with narration describing what
is being shown. The video podcasts are all around 5 minutes long (50MB)
and recorded at 640x360 resolution, or a smaller iPod optimised format.
Transcripts are available in PDF format.</p>

<p>Very little of the original temple and sanctuary still exists at Nemi,
so these podcasts look at four of the items found on the site. There is
a podcast devoted to a model of a temple, about which not much is known.
Perhaps it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votive_offering">votive
offering</a> like the small
sculpture of a women with some internal organs visible. Apparently
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)">Diana</a> was
not just the goddess of the hunt, but also had a healing aspect,
especially for women. Thus when ill, Roman people may turn to Diana and
leave votive offerings representing their ailment to aid their recovery.
Another offering is an oil lamp decorated with what may be a proud
statement of profession - a painting of a street entertainer with his
monkey and cat. This is a low status profession, but gifts to the gods
(and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/08/roman-funerary-monuments.html">funerary
monuments</a>)
were the main way the poor and slaves could celebrate their backgrounds.
Hence the stern statue of his ex-owner paid for by a freed slave. The
narration proposes the statue is constructed in an archaic style, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herma">herm</a>, so as to suggest the
ex-owner as almost an ancestor to the ex-slave.</p>

<p>The non-temple episodes introduce the series and discuss the role of
myth in the ancient world. Myth surrounded the population and provided
purpose and entertainment. There is also some talk about how classical
myths have continued through the ages and still influence us now. These
episodes add little to historical understanding, instead justifying the
course in a modern context.</p>

<p>The temple artifact episodes are interesting, but not vital viewing.</p>
