  <div class="content">
    <p>When news of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Sendai_earthquake">last week’s earthquake in
Japan</a> first broke,
the details and images were largely provided by Japanese media sources.
After a couple of days this changed - the UK media had arrived! These
newsreaders added nothing to the coverage. They stood in front of
devastation and read the news, as opposed to sitting in a London studio
and reading the news. They are just talking heads, what difference does
it make where they are physically. The same goes for reporters
parachuted in to Japan (I hesitate to call them journalists considering
their output so far). One reporter after being asked how hard it would
be to evacuate, said he had no idea, he had only been in the country a
few hours. Why did he bother? The UK media people just seem to be adding
“colour” and making comments on ethnic stereotypes (“aren’t the Japanese
calm and stoic”).</p>

<p>Why does this disaster migration occur? Is it delusion, that the
UK-based reporters can provide a better new service if they are there?
Perhaps it is self-importance, that an important story requires
important newsreaders to give it weight? Alternatively: a junket;
profile building; to give an air of authority; or, to provide a more
interesting slant to a downbeat story? They add nothing and must
subtract a great deal. I can only imagine they are in the way of the
rescue effort for a start, and consuming resources (water, food,
housing, power, etc) that could be more charitably utilised.</p>

<p>All the major news programs in the UK seem to be doing this type of
reportage - Channel 4 have at least 3 unproductive reporters in Japan
right now (not including their production teams). They must have racked
up the frequent flyer points after arriving fresh from Libya and Egypt.
Perhaps the reason the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12702130">growing crisis in the Ivory
Coast</a> is being largely
ignored is because the reporters can’t get visas. This travel can come
across as hypocritical. Jon Snow took a trip to Brazil for reports on
global warming in advance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">Copenhagen climate
summit</a>
(he was heading in the wrong direction for a start). While there I
didn’t see him do anything that couldn’t have been done by a local
reporter. Back in Europe the next week for the summit itself, his
reports noted the increasing evidence that flying is becoming a notable
cause of global warming - like sending a news crew half way around the
world for no good reason!</p>

<p>Am I missing something? I can’t believe that the audience need this
travel to occur to be interested in stories of disaster or revolution.
It just seems pointless and ego-boosting.</p>

    <p>Available on
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=387973532">iTunes</a>
and <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulearn/arts-and-humanities/podcast-a330-nemi">OU
Podcasts</a></p>

<p>These podcasts were produced as part of <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open
University</a> course <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a330.htm">A330: Myth in the Greek and
Roman
Worlds</a>.
However, it just concentrates on a single example, the artifacts found
at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Nemorensis">Temple of Diana at
Nemi</a>, popular in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Ancient Rome</a>. The series is
composed of 8 episodes, although only 4 of these are on the temple. The
remainder are introductions or discussions on context. The 4 temple
podcasts are video slideshows of photos with narration describing what
is being shown. The video podcasts are all around 5 minutes long (50MB)
and recorded at 640x360 resolution, or a smaller iPod optimised format.
Transcripts are available in PDF format.</p>

<p>Very little of the original temple and sanctuary still exists at Nemi,
so these podcasts look at four of the items found on the site. There is
a podcast devoted to a model of a temple, about which not much is known.
Perhaps it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votive_offering">votive
offering</a> like the small
sculpture of a women with some internal organs visible. Apparently
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)">Diana</a> was
not just the goddess of the hunt, but also had a healing aspect,
especially for women. Thus when ill, Roman people may turn to Diana and
leave votive offerings representing their ailment to aid their recovery.
Another offering is an oil lamp decorated with what may be a proud
statement of profession - a painting of a street entertainer with his
monkey and cat. This is a low status profession, but gifts to the gods
(and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/08/roman-funerary-monuments.html">funerary
monuments</a>)
were the main way the poor and slaves could celebrate their backgrounds.
Hence the stern statue of his ex-owner paid for by a freed slave. The
narration proposes the statue is constructed in an archaic style, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herma">herm</a>, so as to suggest the
ex-owner as almost an ancestor to the ex-slave.</p>

<p>The non-temple episodes introduce the series and discuss the role of
myth in the ancient world. Myth surrounded the population and provided
purpose and entertainment. There is also some talk about how classical
myths have continued through the ages and still influence us now. These
episodes add little to historical understanding, instead justifying the
course in a modern context.</p>

<p>The temple artifact episodes are interesting, but not vital viewing.</p>

    <p>A <a href="/blender/tutorials/mech/5_ogre/index.html">previous tutorial</a> showed
how to create a simple program allowing control of a mech model using
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Ogre3D</a> (the mech model was created separately
in <a href="/blender/tutorials/mech/4_animating/index.html">this tutorial</a>). Now
it is time to add a little more functionality to that program and create
a simple shooting game. In this tutorial we will place some other
objects on the screen that our mech will need to manoeuvre around. Thus
some collision detection is also required. To provide some competition,
a computer controlled opposing mech is added. Lastly, the mechs are
given the ability to fire lasers at each other - the first to score a
hit wins.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My first “proper’ish” job was IT consulting for a small publisher that
shall remain nameless. I had paying work before, temping for a warehouse
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock-taking">stocktake</a> and as a teaching
assistant at university, but I never considered them jobs. In order to
provide a little structure to my memories posts I’m going to go through
my work and education experiences, starting with that publisher.</p>

<p>In early 1997 I began thinking that perhaps a PhD wasn’t right for me
and started perusing the University job board. There was a part-time
position to create an online presence for a publisher at a rate only a
student could consider acceptable. It was a perfect opportunity for me
to see what the world of work was like. Previously I thought I would
stay in academia forever. Thus in early 1997 I ended up in the one room
office of a small publisher with surprisingly high profitability based
on the back of low costs in Australia and high sales in America.</p>

<p>The firm was run by a nice middle aged couple, publishing books of what
essentially amounted to tables of data. They gave me a copy of their
latest book and I immediately saw the potential for them on the then
burgeoning web. They weren’t so interested in that, or at least they
acted cool on the idea. Instead I spent the next few weeks (a few hours
per week) hooking up the office computers to a local ISP, training
everyone on the Internet (email, web, some basic html, etc) and creating
a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brochureware">brochureware</a> web
presence. One exchange sticks in my memory. I asked about their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>. “Database, what’s
that?” “Where do you keep the data you publish?” “Oh, you mean
”Quark“:http://www.quark.com/.” It turns out they kept all the data
tables as text in their publishing system.</p>

<p>The most interested person in the office was the owner’s son. At the
time the public was just becoming aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dotcom
boom</a>. He clearly wanted to
make a mark on the world and saw the possibilities in his parents’
business. One day he said he had a great idea. We could scrape the
Internet for email addresses and send all of them ads for their books. I
told him about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)">spam</a> and
that I didn’t want to do that. There were a few other strange
conversations and I always felt a little uneasy around him.</p>

<p>The experience scared me back to my studies, but only for a while. After
sixth months, I left my PhD permanently and started fulltime at
Electrolley (but that is a whole other story). A few years later I
bumped into the son again at the shops (just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#The_bubble_bursts">dotcom
bust</a>).
He said they had employed a few students to build a site for the
publisher and it was going well. No mention of the other stuff. I
checked out their site and it did indeed look good and useful. For a fee
you could subscribe to the site and get personalised access to their
data. I looked again just before writing this and they still exist and
have gone even farther, with more features including most recently
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad">iPad</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>
apps. Yet I have never regretted leaving.</p>
