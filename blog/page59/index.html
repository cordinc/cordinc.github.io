    <p>After creating a simple game with Ogre3D (<a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/5_ogre/index.html">part
1</a> &amp; <a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/6_ogre_part2/index.html">part
2</a>),
I thought I should try a different library for comparison. In this
tutorial I will detail the steps used to create the same game as the
previous tutorials, but using <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> instead.
Unity3D is a commercial game development tool, although there is a free
version with less functionality (I used the free version). While Ogre3D
just provides a graphics library (with plugins for other tools), Unity3D
provides almost everything “in the box”: 3D graphics, sound, physics,
networking and more. It allows a number of languages for scripting - I
used Javascript, as that is the one with which I am most familiar. The
free version allows deployment to Windows or the web (using a browser
plugin), the paid version adds Android and iOS.</p>

methodology</a>.</p>

Podcasts</a></p>

<p>This podcast series investigates the sarcophagus and skeleton of
<a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/p/painted_sarcophagus.aspx">Seianti</a>,
an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization">Etruscan</a>
noblewoman who died around 150BC and was buried near
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiusi">Chiusi</a> (which was under Roman
control, but not fully Roman until after the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(91%E2%80%9388_BC)">Social
War</a>). Similar to many of the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk">Open
University</a> podcasts I have been reviewing, it is
part of the course <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/a219/index.shtml">Exploring the Classical World
(A219)</a>. There are 4 video
podcasts in the series and an introductory audio only podcast. The video
podcasts are in documentary format, normally showing a talking head or
an object being described. The video podcasts are all from 6 to 9
minutes long and recorded at 640x360 resolution, or a smaller iPod
optimised format. Transcripts are available in PDF format.</p>

<p>The videos go through what is known about Seianti, details of her
sarcophagus, a pathologist’s report on her skeleton and the details of a
facial reconstruction. The resulting reconstruction shows a face similar
to the sculpture on the sarcophagus - just younger and prettier. It is
suggested that this makes the sculpture the earliest known named
portrait in western art. The name, Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa, was cut
into the sarcophagus’ clay when it was still wet. Thus the sarcophagus
was made specifically for its occupant, which since it was the only set
of remains in the tomb, suggests Seianti must have been a person of some
note.</p>

<p>The sculpture on the sarcophagus, shows a figure wearing a veil and
bedecked in jewellery. The jewellery was originally painted gold and the
figure white - apparently it was fashionable at the time for women to be
appear pale. However, there is no suggestion in the remains that Seianti
was unhealthy. Examination of the skeleton suggests an active, robust
woman of 50-55 (old for the time), who had children. There were no signs
of violence or long term illness other than a damaged pelvis (probably
from a riding injury at around age 16) and very bad dental hygiene. It
seems Seianti would have had incredibly bad breath, even by the low
standards of the ancient world.</p>

<p>Intriguing and worth watching.</p>

    <p>I read articles on the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/8-habits-of-highly-effective-google-managers-2011-3">Habits Of Highly Effective Google
Managers</a>
with some interest. Empowering, coaching, communicating - sounds like
they want classic “Down” managers. Down managers are those who focus on
the employees working for them. I have had a few good Down managers and
they create a great working environment (and often a sense of loyalty).
Google apparently focuses on retaining employees and keeping them happy,
but is this all that is required? In any large organisation, politics
plays a major role, especially with setting priorities and allocating
budgets. This is the realm of the “Up” manager. Up managers focus on the
people above them in the management hierarchy and navigate company
bureaucracy. A good Up manager will ensure their projects get
recognition and resources.</p>

<p>Many developers lack respect for Up managers. When starting my career, I
considered them parasites more interested in their own success than the
success of the team. However, after being caught in the crossfire of
senior management politics a few times with no Up manager for
protection, I now think they are vital. At one investment bank, I was in
a very successful development team with a good Down person as team
leader and an Up person as team manager. I didn’t think we needed the
manager and then he left. Problems immediately began to trickle down
from up the hierarchy. It seems various senior managers wanted our
responsibilities and budget, some managers I had never heard about
before even claimed our success as their own. For two years, our old Up
manager had kept them all at bay. With him gone the team was torn apart
within months and I left (along with most of the team). Similar events
have occurred at two other employers.</p>

<p>The best management combines both Up and Down styles. Unfortunately this
combination is rarely found with any competence in one person. People
seem to naturally gravitate to one style of management or the other
based on personal preference or ability. Trying to do both normally ends
up in both being done badly. I have seen many try (usually under duress
or desperate circumstances), but only one succeed. More realistically
two managers working in conjunction is best - one Up and one Down. That,
or work in an organisation so small there is no up to manage!</p>

    <p>I quit my PhD studies and gave up the associated scholarship at the
start of September 1997. I needed to find a job fast and I wasn’t sure
how to go about getting one. A friend suggested some agents and I was
soon interviewing at various places. The first couple of interviews went
badly (including the agent sending me to one for which I was completely
unqualified - at least it was short). I began to calculate how long I
could cover my rent before resorting to selling stuff. Then in late
October I found myself talking to Alain at the agent’s offices. It was
supposed to be a proper interview, but Alain’s company didn’t have any
offices and it was more a friendly chat than the interrogations to which
I was now accustomed. He offered me a 3 month contract starting a couple
of weeks later. I accepted.</p>
