  <div class="content">
    <p>The past weekend was <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam 2013</a>.
A gaming event where various teams create games in just 48 continuous
hours. It is not a competition; there are no prizes. The teams are
supposed to be formed at the event (not pre-formed) and the theme for
the games is announced at the start. This is to ensure the games are not
prepared in advance - they actually took just 48 hours to build. The
teams create their games at organised locations around the world and
there is a generally friendly atmosphere. In Kuala Lumpur, the event was
held in the quite plush library of <a href="http://gamedev.kdu.edu.my/">KDU University
College</a>. The bookshelves were taped off,
but there was still plenty of space and seating.</p>

<p>I only heard about this event a few hours before it began, so didn’t
participate. However, the location was open to the public at the end of
the 48 hours, when the finished games would be presented. At KL there
were 5 teams creating games around with the theme being the sound of a
heartbeat. Here are pictures of the teams presenting their games (click
on the image to go to their game page on the GGJ website).</p>

<p>I was quite impressed by the games considering how long they had to
develop them. Getting anything going in that timeframe is an
achievement. They put my productivity to shame. Although I suspect
looking around the room a few people were only awake due to caffeine and
sugar. Bath and bed were probably in the near future for most of them. A
couple of the games looked particularly good. I could see them going on
an app store as simple games with a little more polish.</p>

<p>Most of the participants were students of Game Design &amp; Development at
KDU (only 2 women though, so the standard male-female ratio in computing
continues here). Furthermore, there appears to be an active game
development community in KL. I had feared that most game development
would be sucked south to Singapore (where I know there are a couple of
studios). However, this seems to not be entirely the case. With a
university course, an active <a href="http://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a> chapter and at
least one studio which turned up to see the games too, I hopefully won’t
feel isolated.</p>

<p>It was also interesting to note that all the games were developed using
Unity3D. I think the free Unity tool really helps overcome many of the
barriers in writing modern games. I started writing simple text and
sprite games as soon as I learnt to program as a teenager in the
mid-80’s. Most of the motivation for wanting to code came initially from
wanting to make games. These primitive attempts were not too far removed
from the commercial games of the time in look and feel. It was clear how
one could write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckie_Egg">Chuckie
Egg</a> given the time and
motivation. However, after
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">Doom</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a> I
think the perceived difficulty in creating a decent game greatly
increased. It would be nice to think that tools like Unity and events
like the Game Jam, help encourage people to program by making it seem
again possible to create decent games.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A year has again quickly passed and it is time to assess the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/01/goals-1.html">goals I
set last year</a> and
decide what I want to achieve in the coming year. Last year I said I
would:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Result:
achieved.</strong> 43 blog posts in 12 months.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete the game demo and send it out for comments. Result:
achieved.</strong> I completed a prototype of <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games/#ConcealedIntent">Concealed
Intent</a>
around mid-year and had some positive feedback. I then started on
the proper game and sent out an early build to a friend - more
positive feedback with some constructive criticism. I’m confident
enough in the idea that I will continue.</li>
  <li><strong>Be able to run. Result: achieved.</strong> I can run for about 10 minutes
(at a slow speed) with no complaint by my feet or ankles the next
day. It’s not much, but it’s a definite improvement. My feet are not
100%, they sometimes feel a bit tight, but I haven’t had any pain
for months.</li>
  <li><strong>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: achieved
(just).</strong> I got rid of all my DVDs, some books, old clothes and many
unnecessary papers (e.g. 9 year old bank statements). On the other
side of the ledger I acquired a laptop. I know that everything I own
now fits in around 11 packing boxes and two suitcases. It will be
hard to make further decreases without getting rid of my books, CDs
or desktop PC.</li>
  <li><strong>Leave the UK. Result: achieved.</strong> I now live in <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/12/kuala-lumpur-1.html">Kuala
Lumpur</a> and
plan to be here for the next 4 years. After 6 weeks, I like it here.
I don’t think enjoyment of life will be a problem, but I just need
to be mindful of my career for when it comes time to leave.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain general Blender, Ruby and Scala skills. Result:
partial.</strong> I have barely touched Blender and haven’t used Ruby at
all. However, my Scala skills were improved by the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Functional
Programming course from
Coursera</a>.
There is talk of a follow-on course teaching more advanced concepts
in Scala - I look forward to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a bad track record. I think it helps to just focus on a few things
rather than trying to achieve too much. For the coming year, I will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level. I want
to complete the game to at least public beta where it just requires
some fine-tuning and bug-fixing. The aim is to sell the finished
game and at least break even. Thus I will continuously promote the
game through the year, to build awareness. I will aim to build a
community as early as possible. Especially for the purposes of
gaining feedback (to this end I hope to soon’ish produce an alpha
build with a wider testing audience). Starting soon, I hope to
produce nearly weekly updates on progress at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/">Jarrah
Technology</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that is it! Well no, there are a couple more, but Concealed Intent
is going to be such a focus over the coming year, it deserves a list to
itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Never more than
4 a month. The level of effort required to maintain this blog over
the last year seems about right to me. Many of the technical posts
will probably migrate to the Jarrah Technology blog, so this will
become largely memories, travels and general thoughts.</li>
  <li>Exercise 3 times a week. For the first time in 6 years, I have both
the time to exercise and I’m injury-free. While my first priority is
to stay injury-free, I also want to become fit again, rather than
being puffed after just a slow 10min run.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I have succumbed to a fad - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk">the standing
desk</a>. Now that I have moved
countries and needed to set up my working environment again, I though
I’d try standing rather than sitting. After injuring my foot nearly two
years ago now, I have found that after sitting a desk for several hours
(as I tend to do when concentrating hard) the injury gets worse. Only
very regular stretching and walking compensates for the sitting I do as
part of the normal working day. Moving into our new flat, I found a
couple of small bedside tables that were the perfect height for setting
up a standing arrangement.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/standing_desk.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a week of standing, it now feels comfortable. At first my heels
would ache and my foot seemed tense. I think this was due to me standing
with locked knees and having all my weight run down through my heels.
Now I lean a little forward and take most weight through the pads of my
feet (just behind the toes). Rolling my feet on a tennis ball
occasionally also helps. I also find it easier to jiggle around and
move, rather than stay completely stationary. There is less impedance to
moving around. I can’t say my foot is any better, but neither is it any
worse. In any case the standing makes me more mobile and less stiff, so
I will continue using it for now.</p>

    <p>The end is near. No not the end of this blog. The end of my time in
London. In a couple of days I will be on a plane to South-East Asia.
Most of the luggage has already left. I’m in that weird disconnected
in-between state where I’m not sure what I should be doing. In any case,
this blog may be neglected for the next couple of weeks as I complete
the move and discover first-hand how good Internet access is in
Malaysia. I have heard it is very good and hope to be back soon. Until
then, goodbye.</p>
