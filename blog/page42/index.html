  <div class="content">
    <p>After completing a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Scala
course</a>
on <a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> in November, I was ready to try
another. Since I have an interest in astronomy I signed up for the <a href="http://duke.edu/">Duke
University</a> <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/introastro">Introduction to
Astronomy</a> course. After
eight weeks of lectures and assignments it has just finished.</p>

<p>Whenever there is an astronomy documentary on TV, I usually tune in for
at least the first few minutes. Normally I turn them off fairly quickly
as most are aimed too low or just go too slow. The last one I watched
contained about 15 minutes worth of information in it’s 60 minutes run
time. There was no similar problem with this course. While it started
gently with positional astronomy and Newtonian physics, it quickly moved
on with a week each on planets, stars, stellar evolution, relativity,
galaxies and cosmology.</p>

<p>While many of the facts in the roughly 3-4 hours of lectures per week
were not new to me, the course also covered how those facts are
mathematically determined. Thus while a documentary my say something
like “after 10 billion years the Sun will start to expand”, this course
goes further. It presents the maths to calculate the amount of energy
released by nuclear reactions in a star’s core; how quickly the fuel for
these reactions is exhausted and how the pressure inside the star
changes at this point (including quantum effects like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure">electron
degeneracy
pressure</a>).
The maths stops just short of calculus (thus many formulas are presented
without derivation), so high school level is adequate to understand
everything presented.</p>

<p>There was an assignment every week requiring usage of the maths
presented to solve various problems. This is where the course let itself
down. The first assignment was hard, had a one week deadline and did not
inform the student where they were going wrong. After close to 16 hours
of effort I submitted on time and as the deadline passed received my
grade of 95%. Although I was quite proud, I did not have the time to
continue with the course if the future assignments continued in the same
fashion. The hours were not reasonable, especially for a course that
advised spending 6-8 total hours/week. However, it seemed that many
other people complained, so all further assignments had a 3 week
deadline, allowed multiple submissions and gave instant feedback. Still
assignments normally took me around 6 hours - so the course was an
unexpected time sink. Furthermore, the lectures and marking scheme often
contained mistakes that impacted assignment questions. It is extremely
frustrating to try solving a problem, getting feedback that it is wrong
and spending time trying to work out the error when it is in fact a
mistake caused by the lecturer! I soon learned to wait and only start
assignments after they had been available a week (by which time the
errors had been spotted and fixed).</p>

<p>A very interesting and informative class - unfortunately marred by
assignment errors and required more time than expected.</p>

    <p>Over last last weekend was both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day">Australia
Day</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaipusam">Thaipusam</a>. I went to both and
saw how they are celebrated here in KL in different ways.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/Flag_of_Australia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Australia Day appears to be the premier event in the local diplomatic
community. The Australian diplomatic mission is one of the largest in
town and they aim to impress with their national day celebrations.
However, it wasn’t like any Australia Day event I’ve been to before. For
a start the invite said lounge suit. My memories of Australia Day are
t-shirt optional (because there is a pool) with a BBQ followed by
fireworks and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_J_Hottest_100">Hottest
#100</a>. The event
here is far swishier. It was held in a large exhibition hall, with
projection screens and unobjectionable Australian music playing.</p>

<p>My first impression was of a school ball. Not helped by the first food
station encountered being a chocolate fountain. Although after that the
comparison fails, with a large array of excellent food options
available, including Waygu beef,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamington">lamingtons</a> and a whole fresh
tuna flown in specially that day (morning in Australia, evening in KL).
All presented on little bite-sized dishes so it was easy to try a wide
range of dishes. The audience appeared to be largely the KL diplomatic
community with some local VIPs. Speaking to many of them, they were
deeply impressed with the event and the cost implied. It seems the
Australians set the bar high and dare other diplomatic mission to try
topping it. With austerity all the rage in the rest of world, I don’t
think anyone else makes the attempt.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/thaipusam.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thaipusan is a Hindu festival from southern India, where followers make
offerings to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan">Murugan</a>. This may
be in the form of a pot of milk or the hair from a freshly shaved head
or even piercing the body with needles and hooks. In Malaysia, the
holiday is held at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Caves">Batu Caves</a>
with over a million visitors during the 3 day event.</p>

<p>We visited on the first night and rarely have I seen so many people. The
caves were packed shoulder to shoulder, as were the stairs upto the
caves and the assembly area. Around that was a large expanse of food
stalls, trinket shops, shrines, head shaving areas and more. All rammed
with more people. Gratifyingly, the large red crescent blood donation
area was also completely full. It was a bit overwhelming. There was loud
drumming, people hooked (literally) into decorated canopies, and colour
everywhere (mainly yellow). It was all quite good natured.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The past weekend was <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam 2013</a>.
A gaming event where various teams create games in just 48 continuous
hours. It is not a competition; there are no prizes. The teams are
supposed to be formed at the event (not pre-formed) and the theme for
the games is announced at the start. This is to ensure the games are not
prepared in advance - they actually took just 48 hours to build. The
teams create their games at organised locations around the world and
there is a generally friendly atmosphere. In Kuala Lumpur, the event was
held in the quite plush library of <a href="http://gamedev.kdu.edu.my/">KDU University
College</a>. The bookshelves were taped off,
but there was still plenty of space and seating.</p>

<p>I only heard about this event a few hours before it began, so didn’t
participate. However, the location was open to the public at the end of
the 48 hours, when the finished games would be presented. At KL there
were 5 teams creating games around with the theme being the sound of a
heartbeat. Here are pictures of the teams presenting their games (click
on the image to go to their game page on the GGJ website).</p>

<p><a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2013/lifeline-2"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj13/lifeline.JPG" alt="Lifeline" /></a>
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2013/manic-missile"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj13/maniac_missile.JPG" alt="Manic Missile" /></a>
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2013/marriage-nightmare"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj13/marriage_nightmare.JPG" alt="Marriage Nightmare" /></a>
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2013/kuthatem"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj13/kuthatem.JPG" alt="Kuthatem" /></a>
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2013/high-speed-beautician-showdown"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj13/high_speed_beautician_showdown.JPG" alt="High Speed Beautician Showdown" /></a></p>

<p>I was quite impressed by the games considering how long they had to
develop them. Getting anything going in that timeframe is an
achievement. They put my productivity to shame. Although I suspect
looking around the room a few people were only awake due to caffeine and
sugar. Bath and bed were probably in the near future for most of them. A
couple of the games looked particularly good. I could see them going on
an app store as simple games with a little more polish.</p>

<p>Most of the participants were students of Game Design &amp; Development at
KDU (only 2 women though, so the standard male-female ratio in computing
continues here). Furthermore, there appears to be an active game
development community in KL. I had feared that most game development
would be sucked south to Singapore (where I know there are a couple of
studios). However, this seems to not be entirely the case. With a
university course, an active <a href="http://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a> chapter and at
least one studio which turned up to see the games too, I hopefully won’t
feel isolated.</p>

<p>It was also interesting to note that all the games were developed using
Unity3D. I think the free Unity tool really helps overcome many of the
barriers in writing modern games. I started writing simple text and
sprite games as soon as I learnt to program as a teenager in the
mid-80’s. Most of the motivation for wanting to code came initially from
wanting to make games. These primitive attempts were not too far removed
from the commercial games of the time in look and feel. It was clear how
one could write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckie_Egg">Chuckie
Egg</a> given the time and
motivation. However, after
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">Doom</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a> I
think the perceived difficulty in creating a decent game greatly
increased. It would be nice to think that tools like Unity and events
like the Game Jam, help encourage people to program by making it seem
again possible to create decent games.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A year has again quickly passed and it is time to assess the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/01/goals-1.html">goals I
set last year</a> and
decide what I want to achieve in the coming year. Last year I said I
would:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Result:
achieved.</strong> 43 blog posts in 12 months.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete the game demo and send it out for comments. Result:
achieved.</strong> I completed a prototype of <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games/#ConcealedIntent">Concealed
Intent</a>
around mid-year and had some positive feedback. I then started on
the proper game and sent out an early build to a friend - more
positive feedback with some constructive criticism. I’m confident
enough in the idea that I will continue.</li>
  <li><strong>Be able to run. Result: achieved.</strong> I can run for about 10 minutes
(at a slow speed) with no complaint by my feet or ankles the next
day. It’s not much, but it’s a definite improvement. My feet are not
100%, they sometimes feel a bit tight, but I haven’t had any pain
for months.</li>
  <li><strong>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: achieved
(just).</strong> I got rid of all my DVDs, some books, old clothes and many
unnecessary papers (e.g. 9 year old bank statements). On the other
side of the ledger I acquired a laptop. I know that everything I own
now fits in around 11 packing boxes and two suitcases. It will be
hard to make further decreases without getting rid of my books, CDs
or desktop PC.</li>
  <li><strong>Leave the UK. Result: achieved.</strong> I now live in <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/12/kuala-lumpur-1.html">Kuala
Lumpur</a> and
plan to be here for the next 4 years. After 6 weeks, I like it here.
I don’t think enjoyment of life will be a problem, but I just need
to be mindful of my career for when it comes time to leave.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain general Blender, Ruby and Scala skills. Result:
partial.</strong> I have barely touched Blender and haven’t used Ruby at
all. However, my Scala skills were improved by the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Functional
Programming course from
Coursera</a>.
There is talk of a follow-on course teaching more advanced concepts
in Scala - I look forward to it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Not a bad track record. I think it helps to just focus on a few things
rather than trying to achieve too much. For the coming year, I will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level. I want
to complete the game to at least public beta where it just requires
some fine-tuning and bug-fixing. The aim is to sell the finished
game and at least break even. Thus I will continuously promote the
game through the year, to build awareness. I will aim to build a
community as early as possible. Especially for the purposes of
gaining feedback (to this end I hope to soon’ish produce an alpha
build with a wider testing audience). Starting soon, I hope to
produce nearly weekly updates on progress at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/">Jarrah
Technology</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that is it! Well no, there are a couple more, but Concealed Intent
is going to be such a focus over the coming year, it deserves a list to
itself.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Never more than
4 a month. The level of effort required to maintain this blog over
the last year seems about right to me. Many of the technical posts
will probably migrate to the Jarrah Technology blog, so this will
become largely memories, travels and general thoughts.</li>
  <li>Exercise 3 times a week. For the first time in 6 years, I have both
the time to exercise and I’m injury-free. While my first priority is
to stay injury-free, I also want to become fit again, rather than
being puffed after just a slow 10min run.</li>
</ul>

    <p>I have succumbed to a fad - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk">the standing
desk</a>. Now that I have moved
countries and needed to set up my working environment again, I though
I’d try standing rather than sitting. After injuring my foot nearly two
years ago now, I have found that after sitting a desk for several hours
(as I tend to do when concentrating hard) the injury gets worse. Only
very regular stretching and walking compensates for the sitting I do as
part of the normal working day. Moving into our new flat, I found a
couple of small bedside tables that were the perfect height for setting
up a standing arrangement.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/standing_desk.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a week of standing, it now feels comfortable. At first my heels
would ache and my foot seemed tense. I think this was due to me standing
with locked knees and having all my weight run down through my heels.
Now I lean a little forward and take most weight through the pads of my
feet (just behind the toes). Rolling my feet on a tennis ball
occasionally also helps. I also find it easier to jiggle around and
move, rather than stay completely stationary. There is less impedance to
moving around. I can’t say my foot is any better, but neither is it any
worse. In any case the standing makes me more mobile and less stiff, so
I will continue using it for now.</p>
