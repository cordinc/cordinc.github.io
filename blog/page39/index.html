  <div class="content">
    <p>Last weekend some people from the High Commission and their friends went
shooting. We went to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/City-Square-Shooting-Gallery/131966796850168">City Square Shooting
Gallery</a>
here in KL and spent the afternoon learning how to safely shoot and then
firing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock">Glock 17s</a> (“law
enforcement’s favourite”) at their indoor range. It was good fun and I’d
happily go again sometime.</p>

<p>The event surprisingly took most of the day. We originally thought it
would be over after a couple of hours, but it went for nearly 5 hours
(not counting transport). Luckily, lunch and drinks were included. A
couple of hours were taken with safety and training briefings. There was
a huge emphasis on safety - and rightly so. They said at least one of us
would be stopped by an instructor aswe tried to turn around and talk to
the group with a gun in our hand - and sure enough someone did (not
me!). After the training it was off to the range.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/shooting_range.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We practiced firing at targets 6, 11 and 15 metres distant. I found it
surprisingly hard. The recoil was strong and the gun would kick
alarmingly. I was concerned it might jump out of my hands. As a result I
held it ever tighter trying to stop the movement. My hands and shoulders
became quickly tired. After a while I learned to trust I wouldn’t drop
it and relaxed enough to improve my aim. My practice session shots
weren’t very accurate. My eyesight became fuzzy after a couple of shots
and constantly required a short rest to even clearly see the sights at
armslength. There was also no immediate feedback - I couldn’t see where
the bullet was going. Falling back on old archery memories I focused on
a repeatable action rather than a high score and was pleased to see a
reasonably clustered set of shots regardless of the distance.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/shooting_trophy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then we had a short competition for the inaugural (handmade!) shooting
trophy - 5 rounds at each range. I adjusted my aim, closed my eyes
briefly after each shot, and regularly relaxed my arms between shots
rather than keeping them permanently tense. In the practice session, my
aim was low and to the left (apparently a strong sign of dragging the
trigger with a rough action). So I just aimed a little high and to the
right. I didn’t expect to do very well - 3 of the participants were
ex-military and a couple of others had been before. Thus I was quite
calm after firing the first 10 rounds. It was a surprise to see I shot a
48 out of 50 and was a long way in the lead with only 5 rounds at 15m to
go. I was much more nervous for the last 5 shots and could feel my
beating heart. I was surprised by 3 of the shots firing as I didn’t
realise how far the trigger was depressed at the time. Sure enough 3 of
my rounds (which I assumed to be the unexpected ones) went low. However
the other 2 bullseyed for a final score of 64/75, just beating the
second place 62. I won the trophy (and bragging rights) which now sits
on the living room cabinet.</p>

<p>After leaving the range with the trophy we had some difficulty catching
a taxi. Many drove past us and one made a strange waving hand signal at
us. When one finally stopped and I got in, the driver’s first words were
“is that a gun!”. I had to give him the trophy so he could see it was a
toy before he would take us home.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/12-byzantine-rulers-history/id73802687">iTunes</a>
and on the blog, <a href="http://12byzantinerulers.com/">12 Byzantine Rulers</a></p>

<p>During one of the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/history-of-rome.html">History of
Rome</a>
podcasts, it is mentioned that the series was originally inspired by the
12 Byzantine Rulers series by the author <a href="http://larsbrownworth.com/">Lars
Brownworth</a>. So I went back and listened to
this series from 2005. It consists of 18 episodes detailing the lives of
12 rulers across the whole history of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantium">Byzantium</a>. Some of the rulers
are spread across multiple episodes
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian">Justinian</a> required 3
episodes). There is also an introduction, conclusion plus a suggested
reading episode - something more podcasts should copy. Episodes are
generally between between 20 &amp; 30 minutes. The podcasts are audio only
and are well produced, although Lars can sometimes be a little stilted
as if he is consciously reading from a script, but this is a very minor
issue. The text can also veer towards the grandiose on occasion, trying
hard to establish poetic narratives and themes (“saving the west”). I
find this grating, others may not.</p>

<p>This series starts with the Byzantine Empire’s roots in the Roman
Empire. When Byzantium was still a relatively minor Roman town, the
Emperor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian">Diocletian</a> first
officially split the Roman Empire into East and West. Then
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great">Constantine</a>
founded the city New Rome upon Byzantium (called Constantinople in his
honour) as capital of the East. So when the Western Roman Empire ended
in 476 AD, the Eastern Emperor
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno_(emperor)">Zeno</a> managed to keep his
side going. The people of Byzantium would be baffled by the name now
associated with them. The modern name only arose in the last few
centuries to differentiate the empire from the Western Roman Empire. A
distinction not made at the time. They called their capital
Constaninople and considered themselves Romans, their rulers came from
an unbroken line of emperors that could be traced back to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a>. This caused friction
(religious differences aside) with the later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Empire">Holy Roman
Empire</a>.</p>

<p>Lars then drops in on other notable rulers as the empire waxes and
wanes. Justinian, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heraclius">Heraclius</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irene_of_Athens">Irene</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_I">Basil
I</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_II">Basil
II</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexius_I_Comnenus">Alexius</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaac_II_Angelos">Isaac</a> are all detailed
covering nearly a thousand years of history. The empire appears to have
specialised in political manoeuvring as much as battlefield manoeuvers.
Numerous enemies were often played off against each other. However, the
Crusades proved crippling, with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_Crusade">Fourth
Crusade</a> particularly
devastating (despite both Crusaders and Byzantines being Christian).
Soon after the empire was reduced to little more than city-state. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire">Ottoman Empire</a> provided
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople">fatal blow in 1453
AD</a> as the
invention of cannons allows the great walls of Constantinople to be
breached for the first (and last) time. The last episode on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_XI_Palaiologos">Constantine
XI</a> is the
longest at 37 minutes and an interesting retelling of the last siege and
the Emperor who fought until the very end.</p>

<p>Worth a listen for an overview of a period of history not often covered
elsewhere.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The last few days in Kuala Lumpur have been
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog">smoggy</a>. Today visibility is down to
a few hundred meters and according to the
<a href="http://www.doe.gov.my/apims/">government</a> the air quality is
“unhealthy”. The image below is a comparison of the view when we arrived
here in December and today. If anything the haze is a little worse in
the hours since taking the photo.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/travel/smog.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/travel/smog.jpg" title="KL smog comparison" width="550" alt="KL smog comparison" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday, when the official air quality was not quite “unhealthy”, we
walked to the supermarket 30 minutes away and returned with headaches
and coughing from scratchy throats. Today we have not dared adventure
outside. It is hard to imagine how bad it must be in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22998592">Singapore right
now</a> where the pollution
index is over 400, compared to 100 here. Other places like Beijing have
had even worse. Here the city feels barely livable and there are less
people on the streets. One person commented it is like the horror movie
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/">The Mist</a>.</p>

<p>The air smells smoky. Only the fires producing the smoke are hundreds of
miles away in Indonesia. The fires are deliberately started in order to
clear farmland. Prevailing winds then blow the haze from Sumatra over
the straits to Singapore and southern Malaysia. Apparently it happens
every year around this time (the start of the dry season - so there is
little rain to clear the air, or douse the flames), and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22982018">can last for
weeks</a>. However, this
year it is particularly bad and setting new records for pollution
levels.</p>

<p>The locals are understandably upset. The need to “do something” is
regularly mentioned and there is a substantial degree of anger towards
Indonesia. The smog disrupts business as people stay at home and falls
during an important month for Malaysian tourism. It is Arab month - the
time when many people from Arabic countries come to Malaysia on holiday
to escape the heat at home. Perhaps next year many of these people will
visit a different country instead? We have already started planning for
a holiday abroad this time next year!</p>

    <p>After deciding to leave <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/02/rio-tinto-rtd.html">Rio

my job search was initially half-hearted. It was late in the year and
not many jobs were being advertised in the run-up to Christmas. My plan
at this stage was just to see what was around before starting a proper
job search in the new year. However, the recruitment agent that put me
in <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/electrolley.html">Electrolley</a>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Over six months ago there was a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/history-of-rome.html">post extolling the
virtues</a> of
<a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/">The History of Rome Podcast</a> (on
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-history-of-rome/id261654474">iTunes
here</a>).
This was despite only having listed to a quarter of the 189(!) episodes.
Now I have finished all of them.</p>

<p>The series quality only increased as it progressed - both in terms of
production and content. Most impressively as it progresses
chronologically through the years, the level of detail never drops. All
Roman history podcasts I have listened to before this one skip briefly
over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century">3rd century
crisis</a>. This
podcasts ploughs straight on through this turbulent time in detail -
despite the unreliability of primary sources (which is noted in the
episodes). Similarly, after the Roman resurgence between
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian">Diocletian</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I">Theodosius</a>, most podcasts
quickly cover the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">fall of the western
empire</a>
with little more than a mention of puppet emperors and barbarian
invasions. Here all the gritty details are mentioned. The way
semi-independent “barbarian” kingdoms formed (with Roman approval), the
occasional restoration of power and court intrigues are all covered. It
is particularly interesting to learn of the isolated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_Soissons">Domain of
Soissons</a> in northern
Gaul, which considered itself part of the Western Empire even after
there was no Western Empire left (other than itself).</p>

<p>The series finishes with the exile of last emperor in the west, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus">Romulus
Augustulus</a>. It could
be considered that Rome continued via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine
Empire</a>. However to
continue to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople">fall of
Constantinople</a>
would probably more double the number of episodes. So the fall of Rome
and the west seems a good place to stop. Mike Duncan (the writer and
presenter) has since stated he plans on a new series focusing on various
revolutions. Based on the quality of this series, I will definitely give
the new one a try.</p>

<p>Very highly recommended!</p>
