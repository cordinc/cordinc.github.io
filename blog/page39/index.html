    <p>The last few days in Kuala Lumpur have been
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smog">smoggy</a>. Today visibility is down to
a few hundred meters and according to the
<a href="http://www.doe.gov.my/apims/">government</a> the air quality is
“unhealthy”. The image below is a comparison of the view when we arrived
here in December and today. If anything the haze is a little worse in
the hours since taking the photo.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/travel/smog.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/travel/smog.jpg" title="KL smog comparison" width="550" alt="KL smog comparison" /></a></p>

<p>Yesterday, when the official air quality was not quite “unhealthy”, we
walked to the supermarket 30 minutes away and returned with headaches
and coughing from scratchy throats. Today we have not dared adventure
outside. It is hard to imagine how bad it must be in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22998592">Singapore right
now</a> where the pollution
index is over 400, compared to 100 here. Other places like Beijing have
had even worse. Here the city feels barely livable and there are less
people on the streets. One person commented it is like the horror movie
<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884328/">The Mist</a>.</p>

<p>The air smells smoky. Only the fires producing the smoke are hundreds of
miles away in Indonesia. The fires are deliberately started in order to
clear farmland. Prevailing winds then blow the haze from Sumatra over
the straits to Singapore and southern Malaysia. Apparently it happens
every year around this time (the start of the dry season - so there is
little rain to clear the air, or douse the flames), and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-22982018">can last for
weeks</a>. However, this
year it is particularly bad and setting new records for pollution
levels.</p>

<p>The locals are understandably upset. The need to “do something” is
regularly mentioned and there is a substantial degree of anger towards
Indonesia. The smog disrupts business as people stay at home and falls
during an important month for Malaysian tourism. It is Arab month - the
time when many people from Arabic countries come to Malaysia on holiday
to escape the heat at home. Perhaps next year many of these people will
visit a different country instead? We have already started planning for
a holiday abroad this time next year!</p>

    <p>After deciding to leave <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/02/rio-tinto-rtd.html">Rio

my job search was initially half-hearted. It was late in the year and
not many jobs were being advertised in the run-up to Christmas. My plan
at this stage was just to see what was around before starting a proper
job search in the new year. However, the recruitment agent that put me

  <div class="content">
    <p>Over six months ago there was a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/history-of-rome.html">post extolling the
virtues</a> of
<a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/">The History of Rome Podcast</a> (on
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-history-of-rome/id261654474">iTunes
here</a>).
This was despite only having listed to a quarter of the 189(!) episodes.
Now I have finished all of them.</p>

<p>The series quality only increased as it progressed - both in terms of
production and content. Most impressively as it progresses
chronologically through the years, the level of detail never drops. All
Roman history podcasts I have listened to before this one skip briefly
over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century">3rd century
crisis</a>. This
podcasts ploughs straight on through this turbulent time in detail -
despite the unreliability of primary sources (which is noted in the
episodes). Similarly, after the Roman resurgence between
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian">Diocletian</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I">Theodosius</a>, most podcasts
quickly cover the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">fall of the western
empire</a>
with little more than a mention of puppet emperors and barbarian
invasions. Here all the gritty details are mentioned. The way
semi-independent “barbarian” kingdoms formed (with Roman approval), the
occasional restoration of power and court intrigues are all covered. It
is particularly interesting to learn of the isolated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_Soissons">Domain of
Soissons</a> in northern
Gaul, which considered itself part of the Western Empire even after
there was no Western Empire left (other than itself).</p>

<p>The series finishes with the exile of last emperor in the west, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus">Romulus
Augustulus</a>. It could
be considered that Rome continued via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine
Empire</a>. However to
continue to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople">fall of
Constantinople</a>
would probably more double the number of episodes. So the fall of Rome
and the west seems a good place to stop. Mike Duncan (the writer and
presenter) has since stated he plans on a new series focusing on various
revolutions. Based on the quality of this series, I will definitely give
the new one a try.</p>

<p>Very highly recommended!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Almost exactly 3 years ago I published
<a href="/blog/2010/12/iminra.html">Iminra</a>, to calculate implied interest rates
on Intrade. However, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-09/the-intrade-mystery-continues">Intrade is no
more</a>,
so I have removed Iminra. That app was an exericse in
<a href="/blog/2008/10/is-there-dumb-money-on-intrade.html">maths</a> and learning
the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/">Google App Engine</a> system. It
has served it’s purpose and there is no benefit to keeping it up - there
was only one visitor so far this year.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is the news that another online “betting” site has
discovered a shortfall in customer funds. The other one being FullTilt
poker (although that site has since been acquired, and the new owners
have reportedly paid back the money owed - abeit over a year later).
Luckily I never had any money on either site, but it could have easily
been the opposite - I strongly considered using both.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine of any reason why a customer funds shortfall could occur - other than fraud. These sites should keep customer deposited funds
completely separate and ringfenced from corporate funds. Only removing
money at customer requests or for commission (where the site’s make
their money). Indeed, this is exactly the promise made by both these
sites before it became clear they weren’t doing what said they were
doing. When two big and well-known names collapse under these
circumstances, it really makes one wonder how many others are playing a
little too fast and loose with their own rules. You could say that
people should only use such sites located in juristrictions with tough
regulators and laws. However, both these sites were headquarted in
Ireland (although FullTilt was regulated in the channel islands). I
thing the best bet is to never have more money on one site than you
would be happy losing (not a bad idea considering the purpose of these
sites).</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I am now less of a man - a bit of me is missing. Three weeks ago when
walking to the shops the right side of my abdomen was aching. Nothing
too bad. The next day the ache was still there. Checking Google
suggested it wasn’t
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis">appendicitis</a> as the ache
was too high, but most of the other possibilities were also unpleasant.
I went to the local GP and promptly bounced to a local Accident &amp;
Emergency. After waiting a few hours so I could complete the required 6
hour fast for surgery, I had an emergency appendectomy. When I woke up,
my shaved stomach had 3 small holes and a missing appendix.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/appendectomy.png" alt="Appendectomy Results" title="Appendectomy Results" /></p>

<p>The surgeon described my appendix as “mucky” and “within 24 hours of
bursting”. The histology report backed this up. A burst appendix is a
serious condition, but removing it intact is just an “intermediate”
operation. Luckily it was found before rupturing as I thought acute
appendicitis caused severe pain and considered not bothering a GP.
Apparently my appendix was in an unusual position high up the abdomen.
This is why I felt no significant pain at any point - it was being
shielded by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum">cecum</a>. Get your
long lasting abdominal pain checked out - especially if you still have
an appendix!</p>

<p>I also felt no pain after the surgery. Partly this is because the
procedure was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery">laparoscopic</a>. Only
three small incisions a centimetre or two across were made. One for a
camera to see what was happening. The others for instruments to move,
cut and remove the appendix. Now they are barely visible. Very
impressive. It all went smoothly according to the surgeon. He even
provided a recording from the inserted camera. The procedure took
exactly a few seconds over 30 minutes. The surgeon also offered a
“medical certificate”. Is this like a school participation certificate -
well done for participating on an appendectomy! I didn’t need it.</p>

<p>Some other notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When describing possible procedures, the nurse said that the
decision on whether to do a laparoscopy was based on whether the
patient was “skinny” enough. I asked if I was skinny enough - the
nurse hesitated, umm’ed and ahh’ed, then said it was up to the
surgeon. Cue many “fat boy surgery” jokes.</li>
  <li>If I was borderline “skinny” before, now the decision would be a
little easier. I have lost 4kg in 3 weeks - from not eating for 2
days and then being on a restricted diet for the following 2 weeks.</li>
  <li>I was in a private Malaysian hospital and the care was very good.
Diplomats and partners get health insurance provided by the UK
government up to the same standard as the NHS (so I had a shared
room, etc). The total cost for 3 days in hospital plus emergency
surgery was £2500. I believe this is comparable to internal NHS
costs (as the patient pays nothing) and much cheaper than the US.</li>
  <li>The first question I was asked at the hospital was about how the
bill would be paid. I regularly heard “do you have an insurance
card?” It was all a bit surprising for someone who has only
experienced healthcare in at least partially nationalised systems
(UK and Australia). Right next the the Emergency triage nurse is a
payment station (with credit card scanner). To leave the post-op
ward I had to walk past a Payment Office (and agree to pay the bill
if the insurance firm didn’t). I can imagine it would be very
intimidating for the uninsured.</li>
</ul>
