  <div class="content">
    <p>Over six months ago there was a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/history-of-rome.html">post extolling the
virtues</a> of
<a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com/">The History of Rome Podcast</a> (on
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/the-history-of-rome/id261654474">iTunes
here</a>).
This was despite only having listed to a quarter of the 189(!) episodes.
Now I have finished all of them.</p>

<p>The series quality only increased as it progressed - both in terms of
production and content. Most impressively as it progresses
chronologically through the years, the level of detail never drops. All
Roman history podcasts I have listened to before this one skip briefly
over the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century">3rd century
crisis</a>. This
podcasts ploughs straight on through this turbulent time in detail -
despite the unreliability of primary sources (which is noted in the
episodes). Similarly, after the Roman resurgence between
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocletian">Diocletian</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodosius_I">Theodosius</a>, most podcasts
quickly cover the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">fall of the western
empire</a>
with little more than a mention of puppet emperors and barbarian
invasions. Here all the gritty details are mentioned. The way
semi-independent “barbarian” kingdoms formed (with Roman approval), the
occasional restoration of power and court intrigues are all covered. It
is particularly interesting to learn of the isolated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_of_Soissons">Domain of
Soissons</a> in northern
Gaul, which considered itself part of the Western Empire even after
there was no Western Empire left (other than itself).</p>

<p>The series finishes with the exile of last emperor in the west, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus">Romulus
Augustulus</a>. It could
be considered that Rome continued via the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine
Empire</a>. However to
continue to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_Constantinople">fall of
Constantinople</a>
would probably more double the number of episodes. So the fall of Rome
and the west seems a good place to stop. Mike Duncan (the writer and
presenter) has since stated he plans on a new series focusing on various
revolutions. Based on the quality of this series, I will definitely give
the new one a try.</p>

<p>Very highly recommended!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Almost exactly 3 years ago I published
<a href="/blog/2010/12/iminra.html">Iminra</a>, to calculate implied interest rates
on Intrade. However, <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-04-09/the-intrade-mystery-continues">Intrade is no
more</a>,
so I have removed Iminra. That app was an exericse in
<a href="/blog/2008/10/is-there-dumb-money-on-intrade.html">maths</a> and learning
the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products/">Google App Engine</a> system. It
has served it’s purpose and there is no benefit to keeping it up - there
was only one visitor so far this year.</p>

<p>The bigger issue is the news that another online “betting” site has
discovered a shortfall in customer funds. The other one being FullTilt
poker (although that site has since been acquired, and the new owners
have reportedly paid back the money owed - abeit over a year later).
Luckily I never had any money on either site, but it could have easily
been the opposite - I strongly considered using both.</p>

<p>I can’t imagine of any reason why a customer funds shortfall could occur - other than fraud. These sites should keep customer deposited funds
completely separate and ringfenced from corporate funds. Only removing
money at customer requests or for commission (where the site’s make
their money). Indeed, this is exactly the promise made by both these
sites before it became clear they weren’t doing what said they were
doing. When two big and well-known names collapse under these
circumstances, it really makes one wonder how many others are playing a
little too fast and loose with their own rules. You could say that
people should only use such sites located in juristrictions with tough
regulators and laws. However, both these sites were headquarted in
Ireland (although FullTilt was regulated in the channel islands). I
thing the best bet is to never have more money on one site than you
would be happy losing (not a bad idea considering the purpose of these
sites).</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I am now less of a man - a bit of me is missing. Three weeks ago when
walking to the shops the right side of my abdomen was aching. Nothing
too bad. The next day the ache was still there. Checking Google
suggested it wasn’t
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis">appendicitis</a> as the ache
was too high, but most of the other possibilities were also unpleasant.
I went to the local GP and promptly bounced to a local Accident &amp;
Emergency. After waiting a few hours so I could complete the required 6
hour fast for surgery, I had an emergency appendectomy. When I woke up,
my shaved stomach had 3 small holes and a missing appendix.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/appendectomy.png" alt="Appendectomy Results" title="Appendectomy Results" /></p>

<p>The surgeon described my appendix as “mucky” and “within 24 hours of
bursting”. The histology report backed this up. A burst appendix is a
serious condition, but removing it intact is just an “intermediate”
operation. Luckily it was found before rupturing as I thought acute
appendicitis caused severe pain and considered not bothering a GP.
Apparently my appendix was in an unusual position high up the abdomen.
This is why I felt no significant pain at any point - it was being
shielded by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum">cecum</a>. Get your
long lasting abdominal pain checked out - especially if you still have
an appendix!</p>

<p>I also felt no pain after the surgery. Partly this is because the
procedure was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery">laparoscopic</a>. Only
three small incisions a centimetre or two across were made. One for a
camera to see what was happening. The others for instruments to move,
cut and remove the appendix. Now they are barely visible. Very
impressive. It all went smoothly according to the surgeon. He even
provided a recording from the inserted camera. The procedure took
exactly a few seconds over 30 minutes. The surgeon also offered a
“medical certificate”. Is this like a school participation certificate -
well done for participating on an appendectomy! I didn’t need it.</p>

<p>Some other notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When describing possible procedures, the nurse said that the
decision on whether to do a laparoscopy was based on whether the
patient was “skinny” enough. I asked if I was skinny enough - the
nurse hesitated, umm’ed and ahh’ed, then said it was up to the
surgeon. Cue many “fat boy surgery” jokes.</li>
  <li>If I was borderline “skinny” before, now the decision would be a
little easier. I have lost 4kg in 3 weeks - from not eating for 2
days and then being on a restricted diet for the following 2 weeks.</li>
  <li>I was in a private Malaysian hospital and the care was very good.
Diplomats and partners get health insurance provided by the UK
government up to the same standard as the NHS (so I had a shared
room, etc). The total cost for 3 days in hospital plus emergency
surgery was £2500. I believe this is comparable to internal NHS
costs (as the patient pays nothing) and much cheaper than the US.</li>
  <li>The first question I was asked at the hospital was about how the
bill would be paid. I regularly heard “do you have an insurance
card?” It was all a bit surprising for someone who has only
experienced healthcare in at least partially nationalised systems
(UK and Australia). Right next the the Emergency triage nurse is a
payment station (with credit card scanner). To leave the post-op
ward I had to walk past a Payment Office (and agree to pay the bill
if the insurance firm didn’t). I can imagine it would be very
intimidating for the uninsured.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Most courses on <a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> tend towards the
technical or quantative (maths, science, engineering, etc). I imagine
this is partly because arts courses, with their writing based
assessments, are harder to grade online and the marking system doesn’t
scale well. However, there are a few around. I just finished <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ancientgreeks">The
Ancient Greeks</a> course
from <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/">Wesleyan University</a>.</p>

<p>Notably this course does not contain any written assignments - all
assessment is multiple choice. It follows the (so far) standard Coursera
structure. Seven weeks of online lectures (around 1.5 to 2 hours per
week), with mid-lecture quizzes and a multiple choice assignment each
week. There is an extensive reading list (all available free online),
but only once can I remember details in the reading being required for a
quiz question. The videos consist of a lecturer standing beside a large
TV displaying relevant images. The lecturer appears a little
uncomfortable in front of the camera, but otherwise production and
content quality is high.</p>

<p>With around 10 hours of lectures to cover <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">ancient
Greece</a> upto
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates</a>, the pace of history
is quite fast. Thus this course is a little introductory. An impression
confirmed by the very easy weekly tests. These multiple choice quizzes
give you the answers at the end of each attempt and can be attempted
three times without penalty. I can not see how anyone could get less
than 100% with a very small amount of effort. After
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer</a>, content is heavily focussed
on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars">Persian Wars</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta">Sparta</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens">Athens</a> and later the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War">Peloponnesian War</a>.
Unsurprising as these are the main players and events in the classical
period - and also the best documented.</p>

<p>This is a good short introductory course on (mainly classical) Greek
history with an especially good set of suggested readings. For a more
detailed history of ancient Greece pehaps consider Yale’s <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/12/clcv-205-introduction-to-ancie.html">CLCV 205:

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Funding Circle.html">Funding Circle</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Last year I wrote a post on my initial experiences with Peer-to-Peer
lending through <a href="/blog/2012/06/funding-circle.html">Funding Circle</a>. I
initially got an 8.8% gross return, diminishing to 5.1% after fees and
losses. Now I have been using the site a year longer, so its is time to
update the returns. Over the last year Funding Circle has continued to
expand. The website has improved with a better design and tools (still
not sure about the secondary market though). There are many more loans
available (33 live at the moment) asking for more money (£2 million last
week). Anecdotally, this meant for most of the year the rates available
rose. Although they have fallen recently as more lenders and even the
<a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/about-us/our-blog/government-to-start-lending-to-businesses-through-funding-circle">UK
government</a>
join the site.</p>

<p>So, drum roll, the year’s results are:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.7%<br />
After Fees: 7.6%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 2.3%</p>

<p>Ugh, 2.3% is not a very good before tax return. However, still better
than any UK bank account. Those rates are calculated with the actual
cashflow entering my account. It is interesting to note that the Funding
Circle website says my gross rate is 9.2, but I can’t see how it
calculates that over a single year (unless it is including compounding
rates). Anyway, it is clear that the poor performance is due to bad debt - the recovery figure over the year is immaterial (0.04). None of my
loans are larger than 1.2% of total capital, and most are around 0.7.
The bad debt is made up of multiple defaults. Using the suggested bad
debt rates by loan rating on Funding Circle’s website, I calculated my
expected default rate at around 2 per year by volume (my portfolio skews
riskier than average). Over the year I saw double that and thus earnt a
rate far less than suggested. In Funding Circle’s defence the difference
in suggested and observed default rates translates into only a few
loans, so it is not statistically significant (yet). Interestingly the
bad debt seems to arrive in two waves roughly 6 months apart - one at
the end of summer, and another at the end of the tax year.</p>

<p>After these results I won’t be putting any more money into Funding
Circle over the coming year, but neither will I be taking any out - I’ll
give the system another year.</p>

<p>Postscript: In the last few days and after the above calculations were
made, one of the defaulted loans was “recovered”. This resulted in a 61%
loss on the original loan amount becoming a 39% loss, with no chance of
further recoveries. Better than a poke in the eye I suppose. Had it
occurred a week earlier, this event would have made the final return
2.5%. Instead it will provide a boost to this year’s return - see the
next update in 12 months time!</p>
