  <div class="content">
    <p>It has been some time since a restaurant review post. This is not
because there isn’t great food available in Malaysia. Quite the opposite
actually. It is just that most of the best places I have eaten here are
streetfood vendors or other places westerners may be hesitant to eat as
they look a little dingy. Also, while the dining is excellent, the
service is often lacking (to be polite) - the money is all on the plate,
or banana leaf. Not that meals cost much. There is a joke here that the
quality of a restaurant’s food is inversely proportional to the number
of walls it has (ceilings optional). There is even an informal rating
system from 0 walls (the best) to 4 walls (the worst). As in “this is a
good place, I award it 1 wall” or “ the food was awful - a four waller”.</p>

<p>I’m not sure the same system applies in Hong Kong. We had good and bad
streetfood, as well as good and bad food from restaurants. Although one
place particularly stands out: <a href="http://www.thepawn.com.hk/">The Pawn</a>.
Admittedly this serves British cuisine in an Asian country, but I can’t
remember the names of any of the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum">Dim
Sum</a> places (as they were largely
in Chinese characters), so I haven’t written about them. The original
intention was to try <a href="http://www.22ships.hk/">22 Ships</a> based on a
recommendation. Unfortunately, that place was full and had a waiting
list of at least an hour. Being too hungry to wait, a quick walk around
the corner led us to The Pawn.</p>

<p>Settling into the English pub decor and devouring the provided excellent
bread and oil (a rare sight in Malaysia), we perused the refreshingly
small number of menu options. I had the 24 hour pork belly and my
companion ordered the Wagyu steak, both sharing a side of “greens”. In
all restaurant ordering there is a winner - and this time it was
definitely not me. While the pork belly was very good and melted
pleasantly in my mouth, the steak was exceptional. Perfectly cooked, the
few bites I was allowed convinced me I had ordered badly - probably the
best steak I have tasted. We finished by inhaling a dark chocolate and
Guinness cake - also very tasty. Service was good (far, far better than
we have become accustomed). While at around HK$1000 (with a glass of
wine) it is an order of magnitude more expensive than Kuala Lumpur, it
roughly matches the UK gastro pubs it clearly aims to emulate.</p>

<p>Recommended.</p>

    <p>This past weekend I took part in the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game
Jam</a> here in Kuala Lumpur. At over 480
locations around the world, people got together in small teams to create
a game from scratch in 48 hours. With Yang and Kyle, we created
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/gripversion">Gripversion</a>, a simple
puzzle game. The game requires the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift">Occulus
Rift</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razer_Hydra">Razor
Hydra</a> to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual
reality</a> experience. Here
is a video of a tester playing the second level of the final game. On
this level the hands are inverted (the left controller moves the right
hand and vice versa). The aim is to pick up the red box and drop it
through the hoop.</p>

    <p>It has been some time since I last wrote about <a href="/blog/tag/Games.html">playing computer
games</a>. Largely because I have been trying to
write games rather than play them. Still over the last year I have
played a few and here are my thoughts.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight">Torchlight</a></em> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">action
RPG</a> from a few
years ago. It is the first of its genre I have played and found it
initially very fun. As a player you go around fighting monsters, looting
the dungeon and becoming more powerful, thus gaining more impressive
abilities (at least graphically) as a result. The levelling up mechanic
and the missions seem to be the only RPG-like component - all the better
to gamify the player I suppose. Over time the game becomes a button
mashing exercise. Beating the final boss was just a matter of spamming
the same 4 buttons repetitively for about 5 minutes. I blame the
diminishing levels of fun on the paper-thin story - not nearly strong
enough to grab me (as opposed to
<a href="/blog/2012/08/more-games.html">Witcher</a> which had enough decent story
to happily drive me through the button mashing). Torchlight required
conscious effort to reach the end of story. Then I just stopped.</p>

    <p>The story of my high-school
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign
continues with the characters beginning to inadvertently shape their
world. <a href="/blog/2012/10/dd-campaign-history-part-1.html">Part 1</a> details
the adventuring party’s origins and <a href="/blog/2013/02/dd-campaign-history-part-2.html">part
2</a> explains their rise to
notoriety. We left the characters soldiering on the Isle of Dawn, but
keen to destroy an artefact of evil as payment for the god Kiri-Jolith’s
earlier help. At this stage there are 4 player characters all around
level 7:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Raven - a huge brutish warrior with spiked armour to match his
demeanour</li>
