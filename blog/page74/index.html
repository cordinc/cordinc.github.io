  <div class="content">
    <p>In a recent coding project I fell foul of Java enumerations. They seem
like a very good idea, and indeed they are when used properly. However,
there is sometimes a tendency to overuse them - something unfortunately
learnt from personal experience.</p>

<p>Intially Java had no inbuilt concept of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enumerated_type">enumerated
types</a>. Developers often
found themselves inadequately simulating them by creating a bunch on
integer constants. Proper enumerations were added to Java in JDK1.5 with
the enum keyword and developers rejoiced (or at least I did). The
following example from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html">Java Language
Guide</a>
shows how they are used:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="nc">Rank</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="no">DEUCE</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">THREE</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">FOUR</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">FIVE</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">SIX</span><span class="o">,</span>
        <span class="no">SEVEN</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">EIGHT</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">NINE</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">TEN</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">JACK</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">QUEEN</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">KING</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">ACE</span> <span class="o">}</span>

<span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">enum</span> <span class="nc">Suit</span> <span class="o">{</span> <span class="no">CLUBS</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">DIAMONDS</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">HEARTS</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="no">SPADES</span> <span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Actually, the above is just the basic usage pattern. Java enums can have
data and behavior, as shown in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Planet</code> example below (from the same
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/language/enums.html">guide</a>).
They can also implement abstract methods directly at the definition (see
the guide) but they cannot be subclassed.</p>

<p>I think the first (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Rank</code> &amp; <code class="highlighter-rouge">suit</code>) example is correct usage of enums -
essentially treating them as related constant values. In my opinion, the
second example is problematic. Here the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Planet</code> enum is acting
similarly to a class with each instance being like an object, with data
and associated behaviour. At the level of the example this may seem
acceptable - not much is happening here. However, code rarely stays
static. Requirements change and thus the code changes to handle
different functionality. It is not hard to imagine more data being
required for each <code class="highlighter-rouge">Planet</code>. Object-oriented classes are designed to help
handle this change. Enumerations are not and there is no inheritance,
nor is it possible to pass non static constructor arguments. As a
result, as the functionality of an enum becomes more “object-like”, the
code supporting it becomes increasingly messy.</p>

<p>The general rule is that linked constants should be enumerations, but
anything more than that should probably be a class.</p>

<p>I have broken this rule myself and lived to regret it. A project I
recently worked on aggregated a number of different financial markets
and presented a single interface for downstream clients. This project
used quite a few enumerations. For example, there were enums to define
the market defined type of a financial instrument and another for its
pricing method. These worked fine, they were mutually exclusive values
read from the markets essentially as constants. There was also an enum
for the markets themselves. At first this was fine, each market was
treated the same. However, as the system expanded to new markets and
extra functionality, differences between markets began to appear. More
and more logic began to hang off the market enum. Some was data stored
on the market enum. Most was determined by the environment and was set
by configuration settings. This logic ended up in various special
classes constructed by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factory_method_pattern">Factory</a> classes
switching on market. Indeed there was quite a bit of logic in the system
that switched code path depending on market. The code would definitely
have worked better had there been a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Market</code> class rather than
enumeration. Refactoring all the code to use a class rather than a
enumeration was a big job in an important working system.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I want to talk about this blog. Yes, it has been said <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001282.html">Meta Is
Murder</a>, and I
generally agree with that post. However, I originally started this blog
to motivate myself in my personal software development and learn about
internet publishing. This post will be about the latter (in the form of
this blog) and a later post will deal with the former.</p>

<p>Since the first post 20 months ago on February 5th 2008, there have been
71 posts on this blog. An average of 3.5 per month. There has been a
single comment and a single trackback (although there have been many
spam versions of both, but I deleted them). I also set up Google
<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Analytics</a> and
<a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">Adsense</a> to track visits. At first very
few people visited the blog - 20 visitors in the first months, 3 of whom
were me! Since then the number of visitors has slowly increased. As of
midnight yesterday there have been a total of 14,000 unique vistors
resulting in 19,000 page views. The below statistics are for the last
month.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/meta/blogstats.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>The most popular blog posts are the technical ones. Around 55% of the
traffic comes to 3 pages: <a href="/blog/2008/03/installing-sphinx-ultrasphinx.html">Installing Sphinx &amp; Ultrasphinx on
Windows</a>; <a href="/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-">Multiple
Attachments with Validations In Rails with
Paperclip</a> with-vali.html; and, the
<a href="/projects/tooltips.html">Prototype Tooltip Library</a>. The rest of the
top ten are also all technically based. People mainly find these pages
through Google - a full 76% of visitors originate from a Google search.
Note my specification of Google, all other search engines combined
account for 1% of visits.</p>

<p>One month stands out as particularly exceptional. After publishing
<a href="/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-with-vali.html">Multiple Attachments with Validations In Rails with
Paperclip</a> I sent an
email to the <a href="http://railsenvy.com/">Ruby Envy</a> guys and they made a
positive mention of the article (that was a real buzz). The result was
immediate, noticeable and unfortunately short lived. The blog went from
around 40 visits a day to over 300 in a single day. This is the only
promotion of the blog I have done.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/meta/rubyenvy_boost.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>So how much money does advertising on the blog generate? Not much. I
have made a total of £3.09 through 20 clicks on ads. This is a Click
Through Rate of 0.11, which is about right as I’m told one should expect
a rate around 0.1. Last month was the best month ever - making £0.81.
Long may that continue. At that rate I will be able to cash out the
money earned in just under 6 years (minimum balance of £60 before
actually being paid any money).</p>

<p>The short lesson is write technical articles that are easily found
through Google and self-promote.</p>

    <p>I recently listened to a <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering
Radio</a> podcast on <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2009-08/episode-142-sustainable-architecture-kevlin-henney-and-klaus-marquardt">Sustainable
Architecture</a>.
It was an interesting listen despite much of it being given over to
discussion of well known and generally good software architecture
practices, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loosely
coupled</a> design. It also
spent a little too much time on defining software architecture -
everyone defines terms to suit their own needs.</p>

<p>However, the podcast did raise a couple of good points that anecdotally
feel right and I hadn’t heard before. It talked about an option space
when designing software systems. That is, that there are a number of
ways to design and implement a system. Many developers come up with one
way to build a system based on the requirements; then stop designing and
start building. This podcast advises looking at multiple ways to solve
the problem, thus allowing a determination of which parts of the system
will be hard to change or replace at a later date. How costly a decision
is to change should be a major determinant of which direction to take.
The podcast suggests the result will be easier to change in response to
unknown future demands while at the same time not requiring possibly
unnecessary effort in the present (to handle these unknown future
changes). Interesting.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I have been thinking hard about threading in a Java project of
mine, and it definitely requires a great deal of hard thinking. When I
started working with Java there weren’t any native threads, so it was
just easier to make everything single threaded as the performance gain
was minimal. However, as time has passed more and more of my code both
at work and home has needed to work multi-threaded. As I learn more
about Java threading, I realise how wrong I was doing it before - a
cycle repeated a few times in the last 12 years. It was only after
reading the great book <a href="http://jcip.net/">Java Concurrency In Practice</a>
a few years ago that I realised that in Java “locking is not just about
mutual exclusion; it is also about memory visibility.” I can only hope
that this is the last such cycle, but realise it’s probably not.</p>

<p>Talking to other developers there seems to be a standard progression in
Java multi-threaded programming skill:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Just write single threaded programs</li>
  <li>Write multi-threaded programs by marking everything synchronized</li>
  <li>Use wait() and notifyAll() to build up “threadsafe” collection
classes</li>
  <li>Realise your “thread-safe” collection classes aren’t particularly
thread-safe and try using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable domain
objects</a> with
stateless controllers to work around the problem</li>
  <li>Trust in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?">Java API concurrent
utilities</a>
java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html, with its collections,
locks and executors</li>
  <li>Realise that these classes don’t solve all the problems and start
thinking hard about all the issues in your code</li>
  <li>Become very scared about Java threading</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the next step may be using another language that doesn’t allow
shared state. <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/242">Scala uses an Actor
model</a> to asynchronously pass
messages between threads. There is no shared memory so no threading
problems. This sounds like a good way to go, but I still work in Java
for most of my programming (not many Scala or Erlang jobs around!).</p>

<p>This whole situation reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">memory
management</a> in C<span class="underline"></span>. There were simple rules to follow to reduce
memory leakage, but the problem was hard to completely solve (especially
to a newbie programmer) and normally your program still leaked. I
remember leaning heavily on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Purify">Purify</a>. Then Java
came along with its automatic memory management and the problem largely
disappeared. Developers could focus on the business logic of their code
rather than housekeeping. Hopefully a similar thing will happen with
Java threading.</p>
