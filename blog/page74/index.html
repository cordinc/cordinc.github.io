    <p>Recently I wanted to have a clickable button in a table. Searching on
Google for <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/search?q=JButton+in+JTable">JButton in
JTable</a> I found a
couple of suggestions, most notably this <a href="http://www.devx.com/getHelpOn/10MinuteSolution/20425">DevX
article</a> and this
<a href="http://www.esus.com/docs/GetQuestionPage.jsp?uid=1285">Esus article</a>.
There was also a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/764417/is-it-possible-to-include-jbutton-in-a-jtable/">StackOverflow
question</a>
that just referenced other solutions. None really satisfied me. So
borrowing their ideas I created my own solution.</p>

I could not find a course website.</p>

<p>Professor Isabelle Pafford from <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/12/history-4a-the-ancient-mediter.html">The Ancient Mediterranean
World</a>
podcasts returns for another series of Ancient History podcasts. This
time a course on the Roman Republic given during Fall 2008 at <a href="http://www.scu.edu/">Santa
Clara University</a>. There are 19 podcasts - 1 is a
slide show video, but the others are audio only. Each podcast is around
50 minutes in length and around 50MB. In the audio podcasts there are
often references to slides that are not available online.</p>

<p>The course starts with the stories of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_of_Rome">Rome’s
foundation</a> along with
details of the surrounding area and people, which presumably influenced
early Rome. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Kingdom">Roman
Kingdom</a> is quickly passed
over (perhaps due to a lack of information on the era) for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman
Republic</a>. Most attention
is focussed on the Late Republic, with over half the lectures on the
period from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi">Gracchi</a> to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar</a> - around 133BC to
49BC.</p>

<p>These lectures are full of engrossing details. There is a bit of
historical timeline talk (on this date this happened and on that date
that happened), but the series is more about the life and times of
ancient Rome. For instance, there is often discussion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursus_honorum">Cursus
Honorum</a> (a series of
military and administrative positions that provided a semi-formal
structure to a political career) and how it affected the way people
sought or achieved power. There was also a strong
<a href="http://www.roman-empire.net/society/society.html#clients">patron-client</a>
system, where a person’s power could, in part, be measured by the number
of clients/followers they had. Thus, manumission was common as freed
slaves were typically clients of their previous owner. There is also
some interesting consideration of which events are definitely known to
have occurred, the fixed-points of history, and those parts of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source">primary sources</a> that may
be apocryphal.</p>

<p>Professor Pafford can be an engaging speaker, and it is clear this is an
area she knows well. Indeed the extra colour provided as cracks began to
appear in the republic had me hooked. It was a classic fight between two
political parties, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates">Optimates</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populares">Populares</a> - modern analogies
are too easy to make. Although the ability to raise private armies and
the tendency of losers to be executed adds an epic scale to proceedings.
The final result may be well-known, with Caesar the unlikely Populares
triumphing - but I still raced through the last half-dozen lectures.</p>

<p>It was a good thing I did know what happened in the end, as the end of
the lecture series is missing (hint Caesar is assassinated and his
nephew eventually dissolved the republic, becoming the first emperor,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a>). I would guess that
around a half-dozen of the lectures are unavailable, mainly around the
mid-republic. At one point Professor Pafford apologises for losing some
lectures in a hard-drive crash. So I suppose their absence is
forgiveable. However, like the earlier Ancient Mediterranean podcasts,
there are numerous other production issues. The audio quality is usually
good, apart from a few notable exceptions. The video lecture is almost
impossible to hear, and the slides are small relative to the screen.
Another lecture on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate">First
Triumvirate</a> is split
across two lectures because it sounds like the microphone failed (and
the second part is very quiet). There is also quite a bit of course
administrative talk (assignments, books, etc) - in one 40 minute
lecture, 8 minutes are spent on such course administration topics. At
least the class seem interested and ask some good questions. The
lectures are also presented out of order on iTunes. It helps to know a
bit of history to reorganise them from the titles.</p>

<p>Interesting history podcasts, again let down a little by production.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I don’t like new year resolutions detailing plans to make yourself
better - I’m already great! However, I do like the idea of setting a few
goals. This year’s goals are fairly similar to last years, but a little
less ambitious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 4 times a month. Fairly sure I
can do this with the
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/cordinc/managed-mt/mt-search.cgi?tag=Blender&amp;blog_id=1">Blender</a>
and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/cordinc/managed-mt/mt-search.cgi?tag=History&amp;blog_id=1">History
Podcast</a>
posts I’m planning.</li>
  <li>Only have 2 programming projects going at the same time. Reassess
projects every 3 months. The first two are: learning how to load and
animate blender models in a 3D graphics engine; and a secret
project.</li>
  <li>Complete 3 Blender models and write tutorials on them - the models
are a robot (to learn animation), a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopolium">Thermopolium</a>, and a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broch">Broch</a>.</li>
  <li>Maintain Queuesaurus and general ruby skills. Try to use Scala.</li>
  <li>Run 5km in 25 minutes. This is a bit ambitious.</li>
  <li>Decrease net ownership of physical goods</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Almost a year ago I wrote <a href="/blog/2009/02/new-goals.html">some goals for the new
year</a>. Now it is time for an assessment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal: Improve Ruby skills. Result: Partial success.</strong> I’m not at
what I would consider a professional standard, but not far off it. I
gemify’ed my BBC weather library, but have since abandoned it as
keeping up with the BBC’s constant API changes was frustrating. I
use <a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queusaurus</a> even if no one else
does. I started another project, but it didn’t get far enough to
publicise.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Learn Scala. Result: Have done some, but not much.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Learn Blender. Result: Near Success.</strong> I feel confident
enough about this one. I haven’t completed an ancient scene, but I’m
sure I could.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: Success.</strong>
Doing this slowly but surely - I own fewer things now than when I
wrote that goal, but not by much.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: 48 blog posts in a year. Result: 44 posts.</strong> I’m fairly
happy with that. Holidays and looking for a new work contract slowed
me down a bit.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Run 5km in 25 minutes. Result: Not even close.</strong> The less
said the better.</li>
  <li>On the stretch goals, all are still a long distance away.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the main problem with achieving those goals was my tendency to
try doing too much. At one point (and continuing for a couple of months)
I had 6 programming projects on the go at once. Nothing progressed at
any pace over the last half of the year and that is what caused the most
slippage. Something to be aware of for the coming year.</p>
