    <p>I’m a lapsed fan of sci-fi novels. It has been a while since I last read
one which caused as much thought as Neuromancer or The Foundation series
or the early Culture books. The last sci-fi book I read, the Algebraist,
just didn’t cut it. I’ve also found myself outside circles where
recommendations are readily available, so reading <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/top_10_science_.html">Marc Andreessen’s
modern top 10 sci-fi authors blog
post</a> piqued my
interest and I think I may be trying a few of them out soon.</p>

<p>The description of some of the books as
<a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html">post-Singularity</a>
caught my attention. It is a very interesting idea and reminded my of
the first time I heard of the concept while reading Diaspora by Greg
Egan (from my home town of Perth). The book was lent to me by a
workmate, Dale (I can’t remember his surname). At the time it made
little impression on me at all - I think I told Dale I found it cold.
However, memories of the story have stayed with me for many years now
and I often think about the ideas I first encountered reading it.</p>

<p>Sorry Dale, you are right, Diaspora is a good book.</p>

    <p>I have nearly always coded for myself - that is, not for money or grades
or anything other than my own amusement. In my early teens I learnt to
program by writing a Risk-like game in Basic. During university, I
taught myself C by writing a program to create imaginary worlds because
I felt I didn’t learn enough during the “official” C course. Since then
there have been many little games, libraries, ID3 taggers, etc. My
“current” one I have called YAFAL - Yet Another Financial Analytics
Library. I might write more about it later, but at the moment it is
suffering the same fate as all the others. There has been no work on it
since the new year, it has been superseded in my thoughts by company
ideas (I don’t think YAFAL could make it as a business).</p>

<p>Basically, I tend to get to the point of solving the problem which
initially interested me, and then my attention strays. This has not been
a source of concern. I was doing it for myself, so I can happily define
the finish point in any manner I wish. When working for other people, I
always finish the job. Now I need to go further for myself. If I am to
found a company then I can’t stop after the interesting stuff is done. I
must keep going to release and then continue to support it. Hopefully
this blog will help. By merely stating my intentions online and letting
people read them, I feel a little more commitment to get them done. Or,
at least that is the plan.</p>

<p>So the current situation is I have a side-project, YAFAL, and the
startup idea. Actually, I have a couple of startup ideas. One is an
original twist on an old idea and as far as I know no one is doing
something similar. However, it will be a big project to complete. The
other is fairly small, easy to implement, useful to many people and has
a dauntingly huge number of competitors. Normally I would desperately
avoid competitors. Now I think the small idea is the one to try first.
It will be best just to get something up and running, learning the
tricks of the trade along the way. As for the competition, I like to
think of that joke about escaping from bears - you don’t need to run
incredibly fast, only a bit faster than the guy next to you. If worst
comes to worst it should fail-fast at little expense beyond my personal
time and I may think of something better during the experience.</p>

    <p>One weekend afternoon I was wasting some time and had the TV on in the
background. Some sort of animal bothering show was on and caught my
attention. The show’s image was overlaid with a sign language
interpreter signing along the dialogue. So I turned off the sound and
tried to work out what was going on from the sign language. At first the
host was just annoying alligators, but then he interviewed a young girl
who had her arm in bandages. At one point the girl repeatedly pinched
her bandaged arm with her whole hand in a detached manner. I guessed she
must have been talking about being bitten by an alligator at the time
and waited for the sign language version. Apparently, the sign language
for being bitten on the arm by an alligator is furiously pinching your
arm with the whole hand while alternating between a furious face and a
scared face!</p>

    <p>Since being at uni and becoming properly aware of the working world, I
have wanted to start a company. It has often seemed to me that the
cutting edge interesting paid work in my field is happening in startups
(by stating paid work I’m excluding open source and academia). Perhaps
that is a naive view and all jobs involve shovelling large amounts of
crap, still I believe shovelling your own is preferable to someone
else’s. I’ve tried the more traditional career route. For a few years I
even considered climbing the corporate ladder. I got an MBA and poked my
head into the bottom level of middle management at a large firm and
quickly scurried back down again - it is definitely not for me.</p>

<p>I’ve come close’ish to a few startups. During the MBA I talked about
starting a company with another student, but our investigation suggested
it would never be more than a hobby company (I still believe correctly).
Later, while working at a small consultancy I tried to persuade the
directors to become a product company, but they considered the risk too
great for the returns compared to their current business. Before coming
to London I actually pitched an idea to a few friends who had talked
about starting and they pitched an idea back. It went nowhere, they said
my idea was too big (an open platform for online worlds) and I thought
their idea too small (casual games for ebook readers). Also, it was just
after the dotcom crash was beginning to bite and everyone was extremely
aware of that risk/reward payoff. Two of the people who pitched those
casual games actually started a company,
<a href="http://www.dogmelon.com.au/">dogMelon</a>, although I don’t believe they
ever quit their day jobs.</p>

<p>Since moving to London the startup goal has receded. I haven’t met
anyone here who is seriously interested despite exploring a few ideas
over beers. I used to be of the belief that if you could not convince at
least one other person your idea was good enough to join you, then the
idea probably wasn’t very good. Now, I’m not sure I care. After many
years contracting in London I’ve built up a bit of a financial cushion.
I’m comfortable and have no dependents. I still want to try creating
something and this is about as good as its going to get. I feel its
worth starting by myself (perhaps something small) and just seeing what
happens. I should at least learn more about what it involves and whether
I want to continue.</p>

    <p>Recently I had someone suggest not all was fine with my credit. A little
concerned, I decided to check my credit report (for reference, I
currently live in the UK and all the details I mention should be assumed
to be UK specific). UK law states that the credit agencies have to
provide you with a copy of your personal credit report for £2. However,
it looks like the agencies would much rather sell you far more expensive
deals with subscriptions, online access, regular updates,
commentary/interpretation, etc. I’m sure these packages are useful for
many people, but I just wanted the statutory credit report and finding
the details about this took some effort amongst all the other marketing.
It was nearly an hour of digging across the three credit agencies before
I obtained the required forms. I’m guessing the law states there must be
at least one link from the agency’s home page to the forms, but no more
than that. So to help other people, here are some quick links direct to
the info and forms:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Experian: <a href="http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer/orderPaperReport.html">http://www.experian.co.uk/consumer/orderPaperReport.html</a></li>
  <li>Equifax:
<a href="https://www.econsumer.equifax.co.uk/consumer/uk/sitepage.ehtml?forward=gb_elearning_credit14">https://www.econsumer.equifax.co.uk/consumer/uk/sitepage.ehtml?forward=gb_elearning_credit14</a></li>
  <li>Callcredit: <a href="http://www.callcredit.co.uk/consumer/order-your-report">http://www.callcredit.co.uk/consumer/order-your-report</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Experian promptly sent back my credit report; the other two
cashed my cheques but sent back requests for proof of residency. I will
send them the requested documents.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I now have all three credit reports. It was fairly painless
process, albeit a slow one (although snail mail and proof of residency
are fine by me to ensure the reports aren’t sent out to just anyone).</p>
