    <p>It has been some time since I last wrote about <a href="/blog/tag/Games.html">playing computer
games</a>. Largely because I have been trying to
write games rather than play them. Still over the last year I have
played a few and here are my thoughts.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight">Torchlight</a></em> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">action
RPG</a> from a few
years ago. It is the first of its genre I have played and found it
initially very fun. As a player you go around fighting monsters, looting
the dungeon and becoming more powerful, thus gaining more impressive
abilities (at least graphically) as a result. The levelling up mechanic
and the missions seem to be the only RPG-like component - all the better
to gamify the player I suppose. Over time the game becomes a button
mashing exercise. Beating the final boss was just a matter of spamming
the same 4 buttons repetitively for about 5 minutes. I blame the
diminishing levels of fun on the paper-thin story - not nearly strong
enough to grab me (as opposed to
<a href="/blog/2012/08/more-games.html">Witcher</a> which had enough decent story
to happily drive me through the button mashing). Torchlight required
conscious effort to reach the end of story. Then I just stopped.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Following on from <a href="/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Functional Programming in
Scala</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> is the more advanced
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">Reactive
Programming</a>. <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive
programming</a> is a style of writing
concurrent event-based asynchronous programs and appears to fit nicely
into Scala’s functional programming model. It is claimed this paradigm
is essential for large scale high performance systems - and my working
experience backs this (although my experience is not with any systems
that describe themselves as “reactive”, instead they were just bespoke
or 3rd party asynchronous event-driven libraries).</p>

<p>Over 7 weeks the course is taught by 3 lecturers: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky">Martin
Odersky</a> (Scala’s creator);
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/headinthebox">Erik Meijer</a>; and,
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/rolandkuhn">Roland Kuhn</a>, lead
developer on the <a href="www.akka.io">Akka</a> reactive library. starting with
some more advanced Scala techniques including the introduction of
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44965/what-is-a-monad">monads</a>, the
course quickly moves onto handling asynchronous computation with
futures, promises and observables. The last three weeks introduce
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actors</a> for concurrency. Each
week there is around an hour or two of video lectures and all but the
last week included a programming assignment (taking a few hours to
complete). Production quality is high.</p>

<p>This course demonstrated both the best and worst parts of online
courses. The well presented material is very interesting and probably
very useful for me professionally. I have downloaded all the lectures so
they can be periodically reviewed and spent some time ensuring I learnt
the concepts. So far, so good - I am happy to have participated.
However, the assignments were another story. Firstly, the assignments
were badly specified. For all but the last week (I guess the organisers
had learnt by then), I had to reread the assignment many times before
even starting. I would usually also have to read the FAQ (why does an
assignment have a separate FAQ!) and check the forums (full of people
similarly confused) for discussions on the gaps in the specification.
The whole thing seemed a little haphazard.</p>

<p>The assignments were also dumbed down. After the first week there were a
number of complaints the assignments were too hard. Hence the due date
for all assignments was extended by a week and a student could submit an
unlimited number of attempts using the best result (instead of the
original maximum of 5 attempts). As a result students no longer needed
to write tests for their code - they could rely on the automatic grader
to test for them (doing so before would likely use too many submissions
before finishing).</p>

<p>I did the course to learn advanced Scala, not to obtain credentials. On
this measure it succeeds. However, MOOC credentials will always be near
worthless if students know that with a little moaning they can have the
course made substantially easier. I imagine the lecturers’ motivation
must be to get as many students through the course as possible. From my
experience, the most popular and most highly completed courses are the
easiest. The only two “difficult” courses I have started (this one and
<a href="/blog/2013/02/introduction-to-astronomy.html">Introduction to
Astronomy</a>), were made
considerably easier after a single week. Dropping coursework to the
lowest common denominator may be great for passing huge numbers of
students, but it won’t do the reputation of these online courses any
good.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A non-technical friend of mine expressed an interest in trying out the
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet">Internet History, Technology, and
Security</a> course on
<a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. I agreed to do the course with
them as support. So I ended up studying this basic introduction to the
Internet for 9 weeks at the same time as <a href="/blog/2013/12/mitx-a-global-history-of-architecture.html">A Global History of
Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>Consisting of 4 weeks history, 3 weeks on the layer model of networking
and 2 weeks on security, I didn’t learn much during this course.
Admittedly, a Computer Science graduate with over twenty years
experience (including university) is not the intended audience. It is
for people with little or no technical background. The course acts as a
relaxed and easy introduction to the Internet. Each week consists of
under an hour of video lectures and a mini-test. There is a multiple
choice exam at the end and peer assessed assignments for bonus marks.</p>

<p>The presenter could charitably be called an acquired taste. There is
quite a bit of talking about himself. The highlights for me were the
interviews with various people instrumental in building the Internet.
These include a few of the lesser known innovators like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe">Robert
Metcalfe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert
Cailliau</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson">Van
Jacobson</a>. The history starts
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchley Park</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">Colossus</a>, but then
moves quickly onto early networks and the start of the Internet. The
history stops once the network becomes a given after the beginnings of
the web and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape">Netscape</a> (later
transformed into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a>). The
lecturer does a good job of describing in simple terms how the Internet
stack works, without resorting to code. Instead of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">10 layer OSI
model</a> I learnt at university, a
more understandable 4 layer stack is presented as: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer">Link
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>); the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer">Internet
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP</a>); the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer">Transport
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>);
and, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer">Application
layer</a> (web browsers,
email, etc). While repetitive, the system is explained very well -
packets become analogous to postcards, routers to train stations and
port numbers to telephone extensions. The security lectures are more a
users guide and reminder that a system can never be completely secure.
There is also discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key
cryptography</a> and
how it is used on the Internet.</p>

<p>I think the last word should belong to the friend who prompted my
attendance on this course. They said “interesting but basic, I learnt
enough to make it worthwhile. The lecturer was poor. I probably wouldn’t
finish if you were not doing it with me.”</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Nearly <a href="/blog/2011/01/a-global-history-of-architectu.html">3 years ago I
wrote</a> about
receiving the textbook “A Global History Of Architecture” in return for
the use of one of my photos of Pompeii. When I discovered the
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> course given online by one of the authors and
using this textbook, I had to signup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Global-History-Architecture-Francis-Advisor/dp/0470402571/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293707766&amp;sr=8-2"><img src="/assets/posts/global_history_of_architecture.jpg" alt="A Global History Of Architecture" /></a></p>

<p>The couse is called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-4-605x-global-history-architecture-884">A Global History Of
Architecture</a>
(yes, the same as the textbook), available through
<a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a> and instructed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jarzombek">Mark
Jarzombek</a>. EdX is another
of the online university course providers, similar to the previously
discussed <a href="/blog/tag/Coursera.html">Coursera</a> although with a different
(but strangely overlapping) set of universities involved. Other than
graphic design, there is very little difference between EdX and
Coursera; the manner of instruction, facilities and testing are all
largely the same. A student should just signup wherever they find
interesting courses.</p>

<p>At 12 weeks this is very long for an online course - 8 weeks of lectures
regularly interspersed by 4 weeks with just an exam. The exams barely
qualify as such. None took me more than 20 minutes (the notes suggest an
hour) to complete the various multiple choice and categorisation
questions. Each lecture week includes over 3 hours of video instruction
(cut up into roughly 10 minute segments) with mini-tests. However, these
videos are not specially made for EdX. They are actual university
lectures from MIT - the back of the original students’ heads can
sometimes be seen. The lectures are the jewel in this course. Professor
Jarzombek presents well and is clearly talking on topics that greatly
interest him.</p>

<p>While the topic is nominally architectural history, it is more a general
history of the world illuminated with architectural examples (more <a href="/blog/2011/07/a-history-of-the-world-in-100.html">A
History of the World in 100
Objects</a> than <a href="/blog/2013/09/hsar-252-roman-architecture.html">Roman
Architecture</a>). There is
also regular and interesting discussion of trade flows and migration
patterns through history and how these promoted the interchange of ideas
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memes">memes</a> I suppose). The course
suggests many civilisations rose and fell with changing trade routes.
For instance, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Empire">Khmer
Empire</a> centred on modern day
Cambodia rose on the southward movement of trade between Europe and
China due to climatic changes around 600-1400AD. With the rise of the
Mongols the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_route">Silk
Route</a> re-established itself
and sea based trade diminished along with the fortunes of the Khmer.
However, before this happened Indian stonesmiths and architects brought
their religions and architectural styles to the booming region. Another
example is that statues of Buddha only began to appear once Buddhist
monks traveling along trade routes from India to China encountered the
Hellenistic (and statue producing) societies in central Asia (remnants
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire">Alexander the Great’s
empire</a>). This occurred
centuries after the religion was founded.</p>

<p>The course starts with the beginnings of human society and takes two
weeks before reaching the first towns and cities of the Middle East.
This sets the scene for the nature of the lectures - most time is spent
on art, religion, trade and the way people lived. Then this background
is used to explain the reasons why, how and where certain buildings are
constructed. The mechanics of various religions are particularly
important as most buildings that survive over 1000 years (or were
written about) held some religious significance. There is also regular
discussion of how buildings model certain ideas. The columns of Greek
temples supposedly represent forest groves; the peaks of Hindu temples
model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meru">Mount Meru</a>; the palace
at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis">Persepolis</a> is a giant
meeting ground (like an ancient convention centre). Sometimes this idea
can be quite abstract. Etruscan temples (which along with Greek temples,
influenced the Romans) were supposed to model the movement of birds
flying through the air.</p>

<p>There is also some discussion of how buildings change over time. Many
buildings change usage over time. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon">Parthenon</a> has been a temple,
church, mosque, ruin and tourist site over its 2500 year history. Other
buildings grow in importance and are thus modified. Egyptian temples
grew in power by adding new parts to the building. Churches and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa">stupas</a> generally can’t be
expanded, so instead sites that became more important just built more
churches and stupas.</p>

<p>This is a thought-provoking rush through human history from the first
societies to colonialism. The course presents history via the forces
acting on cultures, unlike the standard tick-tock of historical events.
An interesting perspective and certainly worth a viewing of the
lectures. You also might learn a little about architecture.</p>

<p><em>Sandu Jayasinghe @ 2016-09-10</em> - hey i signed up for the course this year and am kind of nervous about it. I was hoping u to enlighten me on how tough the course and the exams are. as im already a university student and hence won’t have much time to spend on the online course. thanks</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-09-10</em> - Hi, I don’t remember the assessments being particularly hard in this course. There were weekly tests consisting of multiple choice or categorisation questions. They generally took me half the time they were supposed to take. Same with the final exam. The main issue is finding the time to watch the videos and other materials. I remember that being many hours per week. Anyway, all that was over 3 years ago, it may have changed since then. In any case good luck!</p>

<p><em>Sandu Jayasinghe @ 2016-09-11</em> - thanks a lot for the information and for replying. it was helpful</p>
