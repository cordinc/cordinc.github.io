    <p>This past weekend I took part in the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game
Jam</a> here in Kuala Lumpur. At over 480
locations around the world, people got together in small teams to create
a game from scratch in 48 hours. With Yang and Kyle, we created
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/gripversion">Gripversion</a>, a simple
puzzle game. The game requires the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift">Occulus
Rift</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razer_Hydra">Razor
Hydra</a> to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual
reality</a> experience. Here
is a video of a tester playing the second level of the final game. On
this level the hands are inverted (the left controller moves the right
hand and vice versa). The aim is to pick up the red box and drop it
through the hoop.</p>

    <p>It has been some time since I last wrote about <a href="/blog/tag/Games.html">playing computer
games</a>. Largely because I have been trying to
write games rather than play them. Still over the last year I have
played a few and here are my thoughts.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight">Torchlight</a></em> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">action
RPG</a> from a few
years ago. It is the first of its genre I have played and found it
initially very fun. As a player you go around fighting monsters, looting
the dungeon and becoming more powerful, thus gaining more impressive
abilities (at least graphically) as a result. The levelling up mechanic
and the missions seem to be the only RPG-like component - all the better
to gamify the player I suppose. Over time the game becomes a button
mashing exercise. Beating the final boss was just a matter of spamming
the same 4 buttons repetitively for about 5 minutes. I blame the
diminishing levels of fun on the paper-thin story - not nearly strong
enough to grab me (as opposed to
<a href="/blog/2012/08/more-games.html">Witcher</a> which had enough decent story
to happily drive me through the button mashing). Torchlight required
conscious effort to reach the end of story. Then I just stopped.</p>

    <p>The story of my high-school
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign
continues with the characters beginning to inadvertently shape their

the adventuring party’s origins and <a href="/blog/2013/02/dd-campaign-history-part-2.html">part

keen to destroy an artefact of evil as payment for the god Kiri-Jolith’s
earlier help. At this stage there are 4 player characters all around
level 7:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Raven - a huge brutish warrior with spiked armour to match his
demeanour</li>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Following on from <a href="/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Functional Programming in
Scala</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> is the more advanced
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">Reactive
Programming</a>. <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive
programming</a> is a style of writing
concurrent event-based asynchronous programs and appears to fit nicely
into Scala’s functional programming model. It is claimed this paradigm
is essential for large scale high performance systems - and my working
experience backs this (although my experience is not with any systems
that describe themselves as “reactive”, instead they were just bespoke
or 3rd party asynchronous event-driven libraries).</p>

<p>Over 7 weeks the course is taught by 3 lecturers: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky">Martin
Odersky</a> (Scala’s creator);
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/headinthebox">Erik Meijer</a>; and,
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/rolandkuhn">Roland Kuhn</a>, lead
developer on the <a href="www.akka.io">Akka</a> reactive library. starting with
some more advanced Scala techniques including the introduction of
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44965/what-is-a-monad">monads</a>, the
course quickly moves onto handling asynchronous computation with
futures, promises and observables. The last three weeks introduce
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actors</a> for concurrency. Each
week there is around an hour or two of video lectures and all but the
last week included a programming assignment (taking a few hours to
complete). Production quality is high.</p>

<p>This course demonstrated both the best and worst parts of online
courses. The well presented material is very interesting and probably
very useful for me professionally. I have downloaded all the lectures so
they can be periodically reviewed and spent some time ensuring I learnt
the concepts. So far, so good - I am happy to have participated.
However, the assignments were another story. Firstly, the assignments
were badly specified. For all but the last week (I guess the organisers
had learnt by then), I had to reread the assignment many times before
even starting. I would usually also have to read the FAQ (why does an
assignment have a separate FAQ!) and check the forums (full of people
similarly confused) for discussions on the gaps in the specification.
The whole thing seemed a little haphazard.</p>

<p>The assignments were also dumbed down. After the first week there were a
number of complaints the assignments were too hard. Hence the due date
for all assignments was extended by a week and a student could submit an
unlimited number of attempts using the best result (instead of the
original maximum of 5 attempts). As a result students no longer needed
to write tests for their code - they could rely on the automatic grader
to test for them (doing so before would likely use too many submissions
before finishing).</p>

<p>I did the course to learn advanced Scala, not to obtain credentials. On
this measure it succeeds. However, MOOC credentials will always be near
worthless if students know that with a little moaning they can have the
course made substantially easier. I imagine the lecturers’ motivation
must be to get as many students through the course as possible. From my
experience, the most popular and most highly completed courses are the
easiest. The only two “difficult” courses I have started (this one and
<a href="/blog/2013/02/introduction-to-astronomy.html">Introduction to
Astronomy</a>), were made
considerably easier after a single week. Dropping coursework to the
lowest common denominator may be great for passing huge numbers of
students, but it won’t do the reputation of these online courses any
good.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A non-technical friend of mine expressed an interest in trying out the
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet">Internet History, Technology, and
Security</a> course on
<a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. I agreed to do the course with
them as support. So I ended up studying this basic introduction to the
Internet for 9 weeks at the same time as <a href="/blog/2013/12/mitx-a-global-history-of-architecture.html">A Global History of
Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>Consisting of 4 weeks history, 3 weeks on the layer model of networking
and 2 weeks on security, I didn’t learn much during this course.
Admittedly, a Computer Science graduate with over twenty years
experience (including university) is not the intended audience. It is
for people with little or no technical background. The course acts as a
relaxed and easy introduction to the Internet. Each week consists of
under an hour of video lectures and a mini-test. There is a multiple
choice exam at the end and peer assessed assignments for bonus marks.</p>

<p>The presenter could charitably be called an acquired taste. There is
quite a bit of talking about himself. The highlights for me were the
interviews with various people instrumental in building the Internet.
These include a few of the lesser known innovators like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe">Robert
Metcalfe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert
Cailliau</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson">Van
Jacobson</a>. The history starts
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchley Park</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">Colossus</a>, but then
moves quickly onto early networks and the start of the Internet. The
history stops once the network becomes a given after the beginnings of
the web and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape">Netscape</a> (later
transformed into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a>). The
lecturer does a good job of describing in simple terms how the Internet
stack works, without resorting to code. Instead of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">10 layer OSI
model</a> I learnt at university, a
more understandable 4 layer stack is presented as: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer">Link
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>); the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer">Internet
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP</a>); the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer">Transport
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>);
and, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer">Application
layer</a> (web browsers,
email, etc). While repetitive, the system is explained very well -
packets become analogous to postcards, routers to train stations and
port numbers to telephone extensions. The security lectures are more a
users guide and reminder that a system can never be completely secure.
There is also discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key
cryptography</a> and
how it is used on the Internet.</p>

<p>I think the last word should belong to the friend who prompted my
attendance on this course. They said “interesting but basic, I learnt
enough to make it worthwhile. The lecturer was poor. I probably wouldn’t
finish if you were not doing it with me.”</p>
