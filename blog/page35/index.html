    <p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ancient-world/id517589332">iTunes</a>
and on the blog, <a href="http://ancientworldpodcast.blogspot.com/">The Ancient
World</a></p>

<p>This history podcast originally aimed to cover all history from the
earliest civilizations until the start of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity">classical
age</a> (around 500BC).
The presenter, Scott Chesworth, just thought such a history was required
and couldn’t find one - so did it himself. The series covers a great
deal of material over its 36 audio-only episodes (each around half an
hour in length and of good production quality). An ambitious
undertaking.</p>

<p>The podcast starts with the invention of irrigation and the formation of
the first cities in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer">Sumer</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam">Elam</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</a>. The next couple of
episodes carry on with the beginnings of civilization in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">Harappa</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_china#Ancient_China">China</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization">Crete</a>. There is also
mention of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norte_Chico_civilization">Norte
Chico</a> in Peru,
the oldest known American civilisation, and new to me. However, after
that the series focuses almost exclusively on the well documented
history of the ancient Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean. This is
largely due to much of the history of these areas surviving through to
the present day on stone monuments and clay tablets. Scott admits as
much in the final episode, stating he couldn’t find enough details on
individuals or events in other areas to make it entertaining and fit it
with the style of the show. This means that iron age
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan">Canaan</a> (as covered extensively in
the Bible and researched by Bible-historians) is described in far more
detail than China and India combined. Similarly when discussing the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire">Persians</a> most
information is on their dealings with other civilisations, while their
interactions with Central Asian societies is largely unknown.</p>

<p>The podcasts run in roughly chronological order. A particular region at
a particular time will be presented. Followed by another region
overlapping in both time and geography. It can become a bit of a
tick-tock of events and people. This perhaps to be expected given the
breadth of material to be covered, and that most of it comes from kings
extolling their personal exploits. There is not much indication of how
things worked or how life was lived at the time. Occasionally some
details come through, like the discussion of the diplomatic letters
traded between kings just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_age_collapse">bronze age
collapse</a> showing the
ancient world to be very well connected. Scott livens up the flow of
facts when he can with little asides or appeals to modern sensitivities.
Thus the Minoans are “awesome” partly for having no discernable
military; a particularly cruel act is “positively
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria">Assyrian</a>”; and the faux-credulous
manner when retelling the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I#Accession">Darius I’s accession to the Persian
throne</a>. It was also
interesting to hear how large the Persian Empire became under Darius
(perhaps 45% of the world’s population) and how it was run in a tolerant
manner with the local customs and sometimes even the leadership of a
province (known as a satrapy) remaining unchanged.</p>

<p>While it might not achieve its lofty goal (as explained below), this
series does provide a great deal of information on an underrepresented
period of history (online at least). Not many other podcasts will
describe ancient Sumer,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire">Akkad</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni">Mittani</a>. It is definitely worth
a listen, and thanks Scott for filling the gap.</p>

    <p>On first arrival in <a href="/blog/2012/12/kuala-lumpur-1.html">Kuala Lumpur</a> we
stayed in the housing within the British High Commission compound. This
was intended as a short-term measure while a permanent home was found.
However, for various reasons we stayed there for just over a year. The
final trigger to leave was the sale of the compound itself (otherwise we
might still be there). Soon the compound site will be redeveloped.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Since my <a href="/blog/2013/10/day-trips.html">last travel post</a>, we have been
on a few more short holidays.</p>

<p>First a couple of friends from London came to visit for a couple of
days. Certainly long enough to experience Kuala Lumpur, but not enough
to properly leave the city. We still managed a couple of trips to
greenery inside the city itself - including a hike in Bukit Gasing, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Caves">Batu Caves</a> visit and walk
around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur_Bird_Park">Bird
Park</a>.</p>

<p>We then made a weekend trip to Singapore for a friend’s pre-wedding
lunch (the actual ceremony was in London, but many friends/family lived
in Singapore). The city is far larger, greener and more open than I
expected.</p>

<p>Christmas was spent near Cherating. We arrived just after the east coast
floods subsided. Our hotel informed us we were the first booking they
hadn’t had to cancel after the property was inundated! As a result the
whole area was deserted. We also drove up the coast to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terengganu">Terengganu</a> and had excellent
stuffed crab at Tong Juan in Kemaman.</p>

<p>Lastly, I spent a few more days in Hong Kong. <a href="/blog/2013/07/hong-kong.html">My opinions of the
city</a> have not changed.</p>

<p>I have combined some of the best photos into a short slideshow,

  <div class="content">
    <p>Did you think I forgot? Or, perhaps trying to hide the ugly truth. Last
year I wrote that my only <a href="/blog/2013/01/goals-2.html">goal for 2013</a>
was to “finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level.”
Failed. Not even close. An alpha version was sent out to friends in
August and the feedback was “too complex”. Since then the game has been
largely rewritten to make the gameplay mechanics more straightforward.
Only now is it returning to the “early alpha” level of 6 months ago. To
be honest, even if the feedback was positive and no rewrite was
necessary, Concealed Intent still probably would not be finished by now,
but it would be close.</p>

<p>Thus my goal for 2014 is just a copy of last year’s goal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level. I want
to complete the game to at least public beta where it just requires
some fine-tuning and bug-fixing. The aim is to sell the finished
game and at least break even.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even my minor goals will be repeats from last year. Previously, I said I
would like to post around 3 blogs/month and exercise 3 times a week. I
achieved both of these (apart from when ordered not to exercise <a href="/blog/2013/05/less-of-a-man.html">after
surgery</a>). So my “nice to manage” list
is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog on my personal website at least 3 times a month, but less than
4 times a month. Post at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/">Jarrah
Technology</a> at least once a month.
Also try to be more active on other online media, eg Twitter,
Facebook (which is huge in Malaysia), etc.</li>
  <li>Exercise. No specific target, just try to improve my fitness levels
and continue weightlifting (which I have started in the last year).
Try to stay injury-free.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>It has been some time since a restaurant review post. This is not
because there isn’t great food available in Malaysia. Quite the opposite
actually. It is just that most of the best places I have eaten here are
streetfood vendors or other places westerners may be hesitant to eat as
they look a little dingy. Also, while the dining is excellent, the
service is often lacking (to be polite) - the money is all on the plate,
or banana leaf. Not that meals cost much. There is a joke here that the
quality of a restaurant’s food is inversely proportional to the number
of walls it has (ceilings optional). There is even an informal rating
system from 0 walls (the best) to 4 walls (the worst). As in “this is a
good place, I award it 1 wall” or “ the food was awful - a four waller”.</p>

<p>I’m not sure the same system applies in Hong Kong. We had good and bad
streetfood, as well as good and bad food from restaurants. Although one
place particularly stands out: <a href="http://www.thepawn.com.hk/">The Pawn</a>.
Admittedly this serves British cuisine in an Asian country, but I can’t
remember the names of any of the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum">Dim
Sum</a> places (as they were largely
in Chinese characters), so I haven’t written about them. The original
intention was to try <a href="http://www.22ships.hk/">22 Ships</a> based on a
recommendation. Unfortunately, that place was full and had a waiting
list of at least an hour. Being too hungry to wait, a quick walk around
the corner led us to The Pawn.</p>

<p>Settling into the English pub decor and devouring the provided excellent
bread and oil (a rare sight in Malaysia), we perused the refreshingly
small number of menu options. I had the 24 hour pork belly and my
companion ordered the Wagyu steak, both sharing a side of “greens”. In
all restaurant ordering there is a winner - and this time it was
definitely not me. While the pork belly was very good and melted
pleasantly in my mouth, the steak was exceptional. Perfectly cooked, the
few bites I was allowed convinced me I had ordered badly - probably the
best steak I have tasted. We finished by inhaling a dark chocolate and
Guinness cake - also very tasty. Service was good (far, far better than
we have become accustomed). While at around HK$1000 (with a glass of
wine) it is an order of magnitude more expensive than Kuala Lumpur, it
roughly matches the UK gastro pubs it clearly aims to emulate.</p>

<p>Recommended.</p>
