<p>A mobile turn-based rogue-like that plays well on PC? Wonders will never
end with <a href="http://freeholdgames.com/">Sproggiwood</a>!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vY82qyTlDSc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Sproggiwood plays like a traditional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">rogue-like</a>. Your avatar
explores grid-based dungeons in a fantasy world, fighting the denizens,
collecting treasure and levelling upto more powerful skills. What
innovation there is seems to be the result of its mobile origins. For
instance, after completing each dungeon the player resets - all
experience and collected items are lost. Each dungeon is started again
with a basic character… unless items or buffs are purchased through the
in-game store.</p>

<p>Luckily in the PC version, there are no microtransactions. So the worst
of mobile gaming is avoided. There is also a simple story and
replayability through unlocking extra character types (farmer, archer,
vampire, etc). Although there does seem to be some grinding required to
purchase enough buffs to get through the later levels. Overall this is a
well-made, polished and cutesy rogue-like, but it doesn’t offer anything
new to the experienced player of such games.</p>

<p>Sproggiwood is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/311720/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux
at US$14.99. It has been bundled many times.</p>

<p>Destroy the world that feeds you in <a href="http://www.greedcorp.com">Greed
Corp</a>, a casual turn-based strategy game that
plays similar to a RTS, but with a twist!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPAQXURV9Fo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Greed Corp the player is one of four possible factions fighting over
a hex map with height. The basic idea is to gather resources, construct
fighting units and defeat your enemies. The novel twist is that
extracting resources undermines the land, lowering it in height. If the
height of a hex falls too low, then it collapses - falling away into the
mists along with anything on it, gone forever. In practice this means
forces scurry across the map, leaving devastation in their wake before
engaging the enemy on what little of the map remains. Initially the game
works well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the game often ends with one side clearly stronger, but
the map denuded of resources. Thus the game descends to a slow grind,
with one side destined for victory, but getting there at a lazy pace
while gathering the scant remaining resources. Later missions in the
campaign also have time limits on turn length, which I personally do not
appreciate (if I wanted such a constraint I’d play a RTS!). Still the
basics are enjoyable enough to keep a player entertained for several
hours.</p>

<p>Greed Corp is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/48950/">Steam
store</a> for PC only at US$9.99.

<p>Is it a game? Is it an experience? No, it’s <a href="https://www.stanleyparable.com/">The Stanley
Parable</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_OGgGZ9t_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Superficially a first-person walking simulator, The Stanley Parable has
the player wandering around their abandoned office building - where is
everyone? While exploring, a voiceover addresses what the player’s
avatar is doing or thinking, often in a humorous manner. This narrative
is key, as it examines what it means to play games and what exactly it
means to be a player in such a designed environment. It is intended to
be played many times and has multiple endings, but a couple of hours
play will uncover most of them. Well-made, thought-provoking and funny;
The Stanley Parable is closer to an interactive art experience than a
game (in my opinion).</p>

    <p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p>After 6 months and 33 posts on this website I have learnt a little about
how much time it takes to maintain, versus the attention it garners. The
answer: a few hours per week of work for a handful of views. I either
need to massively increase the energy put into promotion (currently very
low), or decrease the writing effort. As this site is a sideline, it
will have to be less time writing. Especially since experience is
clearly showing that YouTube videos are much more popular.</p>

<p>Hence my new AGDP routine. I will try to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">Let’s Play review
video</a> of a
new game every week. I will still post up the video on this blog, but
instead of a full review (500-1000 words), there will only be a short
paragraph capsule review. For more information watch the video. This
should greatly decrease the effort required and allow me to get the post
up within minutes of publishing the video. These will be the main focus
of this website.</p>

<p>On an ad-hoc basis there will also be campaign play-through videos up on
my channel. At the moment I’m a third of the way through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5jYoizlGig&amp;list=PLTLapARdhT1h7MLsPTmkMeyksgXdLMG1b">Tropico
5</a>.
Next I’ll probably do Homeworld or Rome: Total War. These campaign
videos will not be mentioned on the blog unless something particularly
notable occurs.</p>

<p>I hope (but no promises) to put up occasional design analysis videos
with a corresponding post. These will take a longer look at a game I
know very well and will critique the design, good or bad. I have enough
thoughts on Magic Duels, poker and Eve to get going. Now it is just a
matter of writing the scripts. Lastly, when I have time I might post
here about board games I’ve been playing.</p>

<p>So that is the new plan, let’s see how it goes…</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I was going through some old books deciding if they should be
given away before my next transcontinental move in a few months. At the
bottom of an old storage box lay my university calculus textbook. “Oh
no, I can’t get rid of this, it might be useful!” Then I remembered I
had not even opened it in over 20 years. Then I remembered I barely
opened the book when I was studying calculus 25 years ago (maybe that is
why I nearly failed). So instead of putting it back in the box, I looked
up similar textbooks online. There are many calculus textbooks online,
and a <a href="https://openstax.org/subjects">few are free</a>. I decided that I no
longer need a large physical maths book and can just use electronic
copies instead.</p>

<p>The conclusion from this episode is there is good stuff on the Internet.
Hence when it seemed possible I might end up in a Spanish speaking
country (it turns out I won’t), I turned again to the Internet to help
me learn Spanish. No textbooks for me, just online resources. About 7
months later and 10 minutes per day, nearly every day, and I have a
vocabulary of around 1000 Spanish words. Not bad, but not that good.
Small children have vocabularies around the 5000 word mark. Although I’m
already beginning to reach the limits of the original websites - time to
find some new ones. Before I do, here is what I have learnt about
learning Spanish online.</p>

<p>The two language learning websites that seem the most popular are
<a href="https://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a> and
<a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>. I have been using both and they
are very similar, with some slight differences. Both break down the
learning into 5 minute chunks of lessons or reviews. Both teach using
small sentences at most. Both offer some minor gamification and attempts
at community-building.</p>

<p>The short learning times are great for me. I am usually quite busy, so 5
minutes at a time is just right. If there is more time available, then
just do more lessons or tests. The sites remind you to continue daily
and keep a record of how many days in a row this has been achieved and
what should be reviewed next. For me, this is the biggest benefit of
using websites to learn a foreign language. Previous attempts have
foundered on not regularly studying, but both these sites help you with
reminders and a small time commitment. It has worked for me!</p>

<p>Beyond that there are some issues. The core mechanic of Memrise is
memorising lists of words and sentences. There is little information
about how these fit together or if slight variations are also
acceptable. For instance, there are three words for “that” in Spanish
depending on word gender (or lack thereof): eso, ese, esa. However, if
you type that in as the answer to “translate ‘that’”, you will be marked
wrong! Clearly the correct answer is “ese, esa, eso”. This is not an
isolated example. Although the constant repetition does mean the
specifics are learned quickly. Duolingo does a little better, as it
allows a range of correct answers. It also asks for translations of
sentences not previously provided in lessons - rote memorisation is not
enough. Although I find learning with Duolingo to be slower since
reviews occur less often and there is a tendency to dump huge amounts of
verbs (with their conjugations) over a short period, diluting the
likelihood of longterm remembrance of any particular verb.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is shared by both sites. Neither teach Spanish
grammar well. On Duolingo it is almost an afterthought, with small notes
on grammar at the end of certain lessons. Still, much better than
Memrise, which just doesn’t mention grammar issues at all (just memorise
it!). At the 1000 word vocabulary range, learning some grammar is now
one of the two main roadblocks to progressing (remembering verb
conjugations being the other). Issues like how to use direct and
indirect pronouns in various circumstances can be quite confusing, but
there is little information on these sites other than a list of the
possible pronouns. The rest the student has to work out from examples.
Another instance, both sites have taught the verbs acabar and terminar
as meaning “to finish”, yet both mark me wrong sometimes if I use acabar
with no indication why this is incorrect. I had to search on the
Internet to find the issue. Yes, both mean “to finish”, but if the
subject initiated the event to be finished then terminar should be used,
otherwise they are interchangeable.</p>

<p>To help with these quite important grammar points I have found <a href="http://studyspanish.com">Study
Spanish</a> and <a href="www.spanishdict.com">SpanishDict</a>
to be invaluable. Now I am overwhelmed, but finally learning some
grammar (for the first time in any language). Also I think it is time to
try reading and listening to real Spanish speaking people. The voices on
the websites tend differentiate their words clearly and use very
particular language. Unsurprisingly, my experiences online show this is
not the case with real-world Spanish (just like real-world English).
Anyone recommend and decent online resources for this next stage?</p>
