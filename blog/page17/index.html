    <p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p>After 6 months and 33 posts on this website I have learnt a little about
how much time it takes to maintain, versus the attention it garners. The
answer: a few hours per week of work for a handful of views. I either
need to massively increase the energy put into promotion (currently very
low), or decrease the writing effort. As this site is a sideline, it
will have to be less time writing. Especially since experience is
clearly showing that YouTube videos are much more popular.</p>

<p>Hence my new AGDP routine. I will try to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">Let’s Play review
video</a> of a
new game every week. I will still post up the video on this blog, but
instead of a full review (500-1000 words), there will only be a short
paragraph capsule review. For more information watch the video. This
should greatly decrease the effort required and allow me to get the post
up within minutes of publishing the video. These will be the main focus
of this website.</p>

<p>On an ad-hoc basis there will also be campaign play-through videos up on
my channel. At the moment I’m a third of the way through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5jYoizlGig&amp;list=PLTLapARdhT1h7MLsPTmkMeyksgXdLMG1b">Tropico
5</a>.
Next I’ll probably do Homeworld or Rome: Total War. These campaign
videos will not be mentioned on the blog unless something particularly
notable occurs.</p>

<p>I hope (but no promises) to put up occasional design analysis videos
with a corresponding post. These will take a longer look at a game I
know very well and will critique the design, good or bad. I have enough
thoughts on Magic Duels, poker and Eve to get going. Now it is just a
matter of writing the scripts. Lastly, when I have time I might post
here about board games I’ve been playing.</p>

<p>So that is the new plan, let’s see how it goes…</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I was going through some old books deciding if they should be
given away before my next transcontinental move in a few months. At the
bottom of an old storage box lay my university calculus textbook. “Oh
no, I can’t get rid of this, it might be useful!” Then I remembered I
had not even opened it in over 20 years. Then I remembered I barely
opened the book when I was studying calculus 25 years ago (maybe that is
why I nearly failed). So instead of putting it back in the box, I looked
up similar textbooks online. There are many calculus textbooks online,
and a <a href="https://openstax.org/subjects">few are free</a>. I decided that I no
longer need a large physical maths book and can just use electronic
copies instead.</p>

<p>The conclusion from this episode is there is good stuff on the Internet.
Hence when it seemed possible I might end up in a Spanish speaking
country (it turns out I won’t), I turned again to the Internet to help
me learn Spanish. No textbooks for me, just online resources. About 7
months later and 10 minutes per day, nearly every day, and I have a
vocabulary of around 1000 Spanish words. Not bad, but not that good.
Small children have vocabularies around the 5000 word mark. Although I’m
already beginning to reach the limits of the original websites - time to
find some new ones. Before I do, here is what I have learnt about
learning Spanish online.</p>

<p>The two language learning websites that seem the most popular are
<a href="https://www.memrise.com">Memrise</a> and
<a href="https://www.duolingo.com">Duolingo</a>. I have been using both and they
are very similar, with some slight differences. Both break down the
learning into 5 minute chunks of lessons or reviews. Both teach using
small sentences at most. Both offer some minor gamification and attempts
at community-building.</p>

<p>The short learning times are great for me. I am usually quite busy, so 5
minutes at a time is just right. If there is more time available, then
just do more lessons or tests. The sites remind you to continue daily
and keep a record of how many days in a row this has been achieved and
what should be reviewed next. For me, this is the biggest benefit of
using websites to learn a foreign language. Previous attempts have
foundered on not regularly studying, but both these sites help you with
reminders and a small time commitment. It has worked for me!</p>

<p>Beyond that there are some issues. The core mechanic of Memrise is
memorising lists of words and sentences. There is little information
about how these fit together or if slight variations are also
acceptable. For instance, there are three words for “that” in Spanish
depending on word gender (or lack thereof): eso, ese, esa. However, if
you type that in as the answer to “translate ‘that’”, you will be marked
wrong! Clearly the correct answer is “ese, esa, eso”. This is not an
isolated example. Although the constant repetition does mean the
specifics are learned quickly. Duolingo does a little better, as it
allows a range of correct answers. It also asks for translations of
sentences not previously provided in lessons - rote memorisation is not
enough. Although I find learning with Duolingo to be slower since
reviews occur less often and there is a tendency to dump huge amounts of
verbs (with their conjugations) over a short period, diluting the
likelihood of longterm remembrance of any particular verb.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is shared by both sites. Neither teach Spanish
grammar well. On Duolingo it is almost an afterthought, with small notes
on grammar at the end of certain lessons. Still, much better than
Memrise, which just doesn’t mention grammar issues at all (just memorise
it!). At the 1000 word vocabulary range, learning some grammar is now
one of the two main roadblocks to progressing (remembering verb
conjugations being the other). Issues like how to use direct and
indirect pronouns in various circumstances can be quite confusing, but
there is little information on these sites other than a list of the
possible pronouns. The rest the student has to work out from examples.
Another instance, both sites have taught the verbs acabar and terminar
as meaning “to finish”, yet both mark me wrong sometimes if I use acabar
with no indication why this is incorrect. I had to search on the
Internet to find the issue. Yes, both mean “to finish”, but if the
subject initiated the event to be finished then terminar should be used,
otherwise they are interchangeable.</p>

<p>To help with these quite important grammar points I have found <a href="http://studyspanish.com">Study
Spanish</a> and <a href="www.spanishdict.com">SpanishDict</a>
to be invaluable. Now I am overwhelmed, but finally learning some
grammar (for the first time in any language). Also I think it is time to
try reading and listening to real Spanish speaking people. The voices on
the websites tend differentiate their words clearly and use very
particular language. Unsurprisingly, my experiences online show this is
not the case with real-world Spanish (just like real-world English).
Anyone recommend and decent online resources for this next stage?</p>

<p>More turn-based tactical goodness with a RPG twist in
<a href="http://www.hydezeke.com">Flamberge</a>. Having just arrived in Steam’s
Early Access, the game already looks very promising, although it is a
little short and needs a touch more work. I look forward to it only
improving with time.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I have to admit to being a little confused about social media like
Facebook, Twitter and the rest. As a <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">small business
owner</a>, it is commonly advised that I
MUST be active on various social media platforms - and to a certain
extent that is true. However, I’ll becoming a little disillusioned and
not sure there is much value in putting in more than the minimum effort.</p>

<p>Firstly, it should be said that I have found social media a good method
of contact. Some people just prefer to communicate through these
platforms, so it is definitely useful for me to have a presence, just in
case such a message is sent. For that reason I’m happy to maintain
accounts on the larger social media sites. Although, it should be noted
that the vast majority of people contact me through either email or
Steam forums. Interaction with fans through social media is minimal.</p>

<p>Discovery is the main reason I use social media. As a small gamedev in
an extremely crowded market, my main problem is letting people know
about my game. I need to get out the word and reaching as many people as
possible. In this regard I have found both Facebook and Twitter quite
useless. Of course some people are hugely successful on social media,
but that is the same on other marketing channels (like YouTube let’s
plays and websites reviews). A few do well, the majority do not. Most
people do not seem to get their message very far.</p>

<p>The problem seems to be that the people I want to reach are not the sort
of people likely to follow me. A person can realistically only follow a
couple of hundred social media accounts before some of the messages are
dropped (based on me being able to just about follow 100 and see
everything). So most people will quickly fill their timelines with
existing or popular favourites and have little space for extras.</p>

<p>So far that is fine, and to be expected. What causes the disillusionment
is looking at my followers. Many have many hundreds of accounts they
follow, some have thousands. It seems impossible to comprehend that they
can actually see what is being said by all of them. The majority must be
muted or ignored. It seems most accounts are just broadcasting to other
accounts that are not listening. Each week I get several new followers,
but most stop following after a few days… unless I follow them back.
There appears to be a strong gift exchange culture with reciprocal
following. Now I have started noticing a bunch of firms exploiting this - automatically following and unfollowing to maximise subscriber gain.
Again this just lessens the value of each follower.</p>

<p>Just following my friends and a few groups on Facebook produces enough
content to mean I miss many posts, which I find disappointing. I read
every tweet in my timeline - if I follow you, I read what you publish.
To me that seems to be the point of the system, but apparently not to a
large number of people. Instead it is about greater number of followers
or friend’s even if the result is effectively zero actual communication.</p>

<p>Am I missing something?</p>
