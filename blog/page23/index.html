  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Time for the <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">annual report</a> on the
performance of my peer-to-peer lending investment. <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/">Funding
Circle</a> is doing very well: they have
doubled the total amount loaned out; opened a US website; and, now can
be included as part of a tax-free ISA in the UK. Some of that extra
money loaned is mine. After last year’s good returns (much better than
other UK investments), I decided to add some extra money to my account.
So in retrospect, was that the right decision? Have the investors done
as well as the company?</p>

<p>Here are the returns for the last UK tax year:</p>

<p>Gross: 10.0%<br />
After Fees: 8.8%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 10.4%</p>

<p>Wow, my best year, and by a long way. 10.4% is an extremely respectable
return, especially in a year where the FTSE-100 share indexed has
declined. According to Funding Circle my lifetime (5 years) return is
currently 6.4%, also very good.</p>

<p>Gross returns have risen around 2%, with fees roughly matching the rise.
However, the biggest gain has been net bad debt/recoveries. In the last
year I have only had a single loan go bad - much better than previous
years. Recoveries have been huge! Larger than the loss and even larger
than the fees paid this year. Thus a total return higher than the gross
return! Kudos to Funding Circle team as they have now recovered about
half the bad debt from previous years.</p>

<p>So with that kind of return I should be adding more money to the
account, right? Unfortunately not. I manually choose all the loan offers
joined, as opposed to using the autobid tool. As my criteria has
tightened (small, guaranteed, short term loans to profitable, tax paying
companies with good credit rating and acceptable working capital), my
bad debt rate has dropped below the site average, despite making over a
hundred loans per year.</p>

<p>Since a rule change in the way Funding Circle works at the end of last
year (fixed returns rather than an auction), it has become increasingly
difficult to find loans to fund. This is not due to a lack of loans
available, or even a decrease in their quality. Instead it is because
the loans are filled in a matter of hours rather than days. Now most of
the best loans are already filled and closed before I even get a chance
to see them. Most frustrating.</p>

<p>As a result I have built up a surplus of non-invested money on Funding
Circle. Money that is not earning any interest (for me anyway). Enough
to fund several weeks worth of loans under the old system, but
currently, and for several months, there have not been enough
opportunities. My options are to relax my lending criteria, or start
using their autobid tool (effectively lowering my standards anyway).
Alternatively, I can accept my time on the site is over and start to
slowly empty my account (it will take a long time to close out some of
the loans, even with their secondary market). I have yet to decide what
to do.</p>

<p>Tune in next year to see what happens!</p>

    <p>Over the past two weeks we have driven up the east coast of Malaysia for
a holiday. From the south-eastern tip of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor">Johor</a> (with a detour to see
Legoland) through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahang">Pahang</a>,
including several days on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tioman_Island">Pulau
Tioman</a>. From there we
stayed some time in (probably our favourite)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terengganu">Terengganu</a>. The finish in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan">Kelantan</a>, had us driving up a
broken and bumpy road to the river marking the Thai border. We drove
back through the centre of the peninsula and ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_oil">Palm
plantations</a>.</p>

<p>My best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/eastcoast_16.html">available
here</a>. I tried to keep away from posting
too many of the endless empty beach photos inevitably accumulated from
such a journey.</p>

    <p>As an experiment, I recently recorded my first Let’s Play on YouTube.
The chosen game is the pre-alpha demo of
<a href="http://www.wartile.com">Wartile</a> - a tabletop inspired tactical combat
game with a Viking theme. The video’s concept is to look at the game
from the point-of-view of a another game developer and talk about the
design of the game as well as the gameplay. I might do more similar
videos in future.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ketg1llwpt0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The TL;DWatch version is that Wartile is is a fun playable demo and the
game is already very pretty. It is a good base on which to build a great
gaming experience with a bit of extra polish. For me, one issue is that
the core game mechanic feels a little confused. Some parts of the game
suggest a turn-based game, but it plays as a real-time game.</p>

    <p>After telling the below story to a couple of people, they thought it
should be shared more widely.</p>

<p>Scene: I call my UK business bank over an issue I’m having with a bank
transfer. After waiting on hold for several minutes, I reach a Customer
Service Representative and verify my identity. They ask why I’m calling.</p>

<p>Me: Hi, I can’t transfer money to an account at another bank.</p>

<p>Customer Service Rep (CSR): Sorry to hear that, let me check your
account… Hmmm, yes, there appears to be a block on your account. It
seems we had some returned mail so as a fraud precaution a transaction
and mail block was placed on your account in December. Someone tried to
call at the time, but was unable to contact you. I can remove the block.</p>

<p>Me: Hang on, December? I have received mail since then, I have a letter
from from you in my hand right now.</p>

<p>CSR: When is it dated?</p>

<p>Me: February, it is the February account statement.</p>

<p>CSR: Oh, that’s strange, let me check… Ah, yes. The fraud prevention
block is on the credit card card account. Your current account does not
have a block.</p>

<p>Me: So to because some mail was returned you stopped my credit card
mail, but my current account mail was still sent and all arrived fine.
That doesn’t seem right.</p>

<p>CSR: They are on different systems. The block only applies to one.</p>

<p>Me: So one system thought there was a fraud issue, while the other
thought it was all fine and kept sending mail?</p>

<p>CSR: Yes.</p>

<p>Me: Ok… I don’t really need the mail anyway, can you send less?</p>

<p>CSR: Yes, we can put you on our paperless plan, then you will only
received credit card statements and any current account statement that
includes a fee we have charged.</p>

<p>Me: But you charge me a fee every month.</p>

<p>CSR: Um, yes, that’s right.</p>

<p>Me: So you will send exactly the same amount of mail on the paperless
system as you do now.</p>

<p>CSR: Yes.</p>

<p>Me: Ok, don’t bother then, just please remove the block. My mail arrives
fine.</p>

<p>CSR: That is done, anything else I can help you with.</p>

<p>Me: No, bye.</p>

<p>I may have been a little abrupt there at the end. My apologies to the
customer service rep who was stuck in a bad situation. However, this is
just silliness from one of my banks and sadly not recently out of
character. I am becoming increasingly irritated by their strange
requirements, poor customer service, and outright refusal to do many
tasks other banks perform without issue. They also advertise themselves
as an international bank, but this appears to manifest itself largely in
their marketing copy. I certainly have trouble discerning much
international service. Four years ago I recommended this bank to another
person. This year I suggested another person completely avoid them. I
hope to soon take my own advice.</p>

<p>Also, I screen my calls, so that person may have called in December but
definitely did not leave a message - I check them all.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Here is the second and final posting on gaming podcasts - this one
looking at game design podcasts.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://thegamedesignroundtable.com">Game Design Roundtable</a></em> is
hosted by a few working game designers including Rob Daviau (one of the
two people behind the excellent board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1">Pandemic
Legacy</a>).
There is no set structure. Sometimes the hosts just have a chat catching
up on what they are working on. Sometimes they interview another game
designer from various parts of the gaming industry (boardgames, card
games or computer games). Although my favourites are the “Listener
Mailbag” episodes - a whole 40-60 minutes of the hosts answering
listener questions, from quite specific game design problems to business
issues. This is a really good series and I learn something new with each
episode. It also should make indie computer gamedevs thankful for not
being in the board game industry - the success of Pandemic Legacy aside,
it seems like a much tougher way to make a living.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.designer-notes.com">Designer Notes</a></em> is a series of
interviews presented by Soren Johnson, the lead designer of Civilization
IV (although he does not actually conduct all the interviews). Each
month an experienced game designer (usually from the computer game
industry) is questioned at length about how they got into game design
and the course of their career. While the names of the designers may not
be well-known, the games they have worked on certainly are! I have
listened to about half the series and heard from the designers of World
of Warcraft, Crusader Kings 2, Triple Town and Planescape. The episodes
tend to be quite long, some going past the 2 hour mark. There is
definitely a great deal of game design talent present, but unfortunately
little in the way of usable information for the aspiring designer.
Instead the questions focus more on personality, personal history, how
careers in the industry progress (or meander, as it appears), and the
stories of how certain games were made. Still very interesting
(depending on the interviewee), although I tend to listen only when
doing something else at the same time.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://slangdesign.com/rppr/category/game-designer-workshop/">RPPR Game Designers
Workshop</a></em>
is a sub-series within the RPPR podcast. RPPR does tabletop RPG news and
recorded play sessions (pretty good), but mixed in with the rest of
their episodes is this irregular series. Two of the members of the usual
team are designing their own RPG’s and these podcasts detail their
travails as they go (or “failing in realtime, so you don’t have to” as
they say). The series has been going for a while (10 episodes over 2.5
years) and demonstrates certain invariants of game design - prototyping,
play-testing, iteration. It also makes me glad I’m not an tabletop RPG
designer (computer game devs have it easy)! The presenters are
entertaining and the content illuminating. Worth a listen.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.kenandrobintalkaboutstuff.com">Ken &amp; Robin Talk About
Stuff</a></em> is Ken Hite &amp; Robin
Laws talking on various topics. They are both tabletop RPG designers
with many successful games behind them. Both are excellent and
entertaining speakers regardless of the subject matter. Unsurprisingly
the podcast tends towards tabletop RPGs (how to play, game suggestions,
etc), but I’ve also heard them cover (each multiple times) history,
films, maps, politics, occult figures, even cooking. There is little
directly applicable to computer game design, but the density of ideas is
incredible. I’ve listened to over 100 episodes and always have an idea
for a cool game afterwards. A great podcast to fire the imagination.</p>
