  <div class="content">
    <p>It has been a couple of months since releasing <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed Intent onto
Steam Early Access</a> it is
time to assess how things have gone and plan for the future.</p>

<p>While I’m quite happy with Concealed Intent as a game, financially it
has been a disappointment. Largely this is my own fault. As a sole
developer I must make a choice between developing or marketing. I have
overwhelming chosen dev work over the last 2 months. Still the sales
have still resulted in a few people playing it and providing feedback.
It has highlighted a some bugs and issues, most of which are now fixed.
Early Access has also given me a focus - single player skirmishes seem
to be more highly desired than online play (lucky because there are not
enough players to form a decent online community right now). This is
immensely useful information. Previously the game was trying to be a bit
of everything in the hope of attracting the attention of a potential
purchaser. Now it will be mainly single-player, where skirmish is the
main game, but there is a also basic online play so you can challenge
your friends.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/assets/posts/new_skirmish.png"><img src="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/assets/posts/new_skirmish_thumb.png" alt="Concealed Intent Skirmish" /></a></p>

<p>Under this vision, the way forward to release is clear. Procedural
skirmish must be expanded with an AI that can provide some challenge.
The single-player campaign can be shortened but needs to more engaging
while subtlety teaching the game. Online play is largely done, only bug
fixes and performance enhancements remain.</p>

<p>So that is the plan to finish Concealed Intent. Skirmish improvements,
then AI improvements, then mission work, then… done? At least in the
sense of a proper “release”, yes it will be done. The majority of my
time after that point will be spent on developing other games. There
will still be a few things to do Linux support, non-Steam online
support, other little improvements and of course bug fixes as required.</p>

<p>Right now I’ve nearly finished a first pass at the Skirmish
improvements. If it was not for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org">GGJ16</a> I’d
release it this weekend. Instead it will be available early next week
(so I’m around if there is a problem). I hope to have a final version
with improved AI by mid-Feb. Then I foresee a couple more fortnightly
versions iterating on the campaign and improving skirmish &amp; AI as
issues/ideas arise. However, that will not be the end. As previously
stated, I have to choose between development and marketing. Since I have
a couple of months of dev work, I will continue mainly with that for
now. However, when the above task list is complete it will be time to
switch. Thus the plan is to finish the dev work, wait at least a week to
ensure there are no bad bugs, then start a 30 day release countdown
where I spend a few hours per day solely on marketing. Then the release,
followed by another week of marketing. Then just see.</p>

<p>One thing I don’t expect to see is a flood of sales. I hope to have
enough sales to cover my costs and provide enough money for a future
game. The feedback received so far is generally positive, but not “indie
breakout hit” positive. I will likely struggle for media coverage and
sales amongst a horde of other indie games. One advantage I have is that
my situation is unchanged, there is not much I could be doing other than
creating games. I have another 15 months before reality returns. Thus I
can create another game with my hard-won lessons from Concealed Intent.
In fact since the main lesson learnt is to make much smaller games,
hopefully I can make more than one. Ideal would be a couple of short (3
month dev work) games made with an artist willing to profit-share (to
keep upfront costs down). I have collected a few such small ideas and it
is time to start creating prototypes to check if they are worth
pursuing. By mid-Feb I hope to be spending about 10-20% of my time on
this task - a pipeline of work must be established to take over from
Concealed Intent as it requires less time (not counting marketing of
course!). Otherwise there will be no chance of continuing gamedev as a
profession long-term.</p>

<p>The other main lesson is that marketing is hard. Very hard. There are a
large number of people out to get keys for “reviews”, but very few can
deliver and those asking are almost always the smaller media outlets.
The larger ones are probably swamped with review requests. Getting
noticed is difficult. During the release-30 countdown I’ll do my best to
let people know Concealed Intent exists. Although I’ve also been
considering trying to become the media. Sure, I have a couple of rarely
viewed blogs (like this one), but viewing some the of key requesters’
outlets made me wonder if I could try that too. Basically an attempt to
build a community around games in general, not specifically my games.
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won’t (check back here to find out!). I
have a few ideas on how to make things a little different to others, now
I just need to check the time requirements. There will probably be one
video just to experiment.</p>

<p>Hmm, still so much to do and so many possibilities. But first to GGJ16…</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><em>There is the theory of the Moebius, a twist in the fabric of space
where time becomes a loop.</em></p>

<p>Wise words from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNb4VKln1uw">Worf</a>.</p>

<p>No, wait. <a href="/blog/2015/01/goals-4.html">That was last year</a>. I just
repeat myself over, and over, …</p>

<p>Actually there is a little difference to last year. Back then my main
goal was to complete Concealed Intent to a saleable level. Well, it
might only be Steam Early Access, but the game went on <a href="/blog/2015/11/release.html">sale in
November</a>. So now the slightly changed new
year’s goals are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Make a full-release of Concealed Intent and market it. Then start,
complete and release a second game.</strong> I’m fairly confident about the
first part of this goal. There is only one main feature left on the
Concealed Intent todo list. I expect that is a month or two’s work
at most. Then it will be time to polish the game and prepare for a
release. The second part of the goal is based on the idea that CI is
just way too big. I need to create much smaller games and turn them
out faster - any other strategy is immensely risky.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog on my personal website at least 2 times a month, but less
than 4 times a month.</strong> Plus also try to be more active on other
media. Last year my blogging was on schedule until a self imposed
crunch to complete CI hit around August - finishing with 22 posts
for the year. For the coming year, the bounds are widened slightly
from 3-4/month to 2-4/month. Since I plan to avoid crunching again,
this should be easy!</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><strong>Exercise.</strong> In August last year I was the strongest I’ve ever been
based on the weights I could lift (not bad for a 41 year old). I
could also run for 30min without pain - something I’ve never been
able to do previously. Then I stopped to make more time for coding.
My voracious appetite (based on lots of exercise) continued despite
being at a desk all day, so I put on several kilos of weight. When I
started running again a few weeks ago, my fitness had greatly
regressed and managed only 15 minutes. I haven’t tried going back to
the gym yet. This year I hope to recover the previous performance
peak, and then surpass it.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dan-carlins-hardcore-history/id173001861">iTunes</a>
and from <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">its own
site</a>, this 5-part
series is a free subset of a larger set of history podcasts. Having only
listened to the 5 Mongol episodes, I can’t talk to the larger sequence.</p>

<p>At first glance of the name and promotional images, Wrath of the Khans -
Hardcore History, seems like it might be a podcast playing up the more
sensationalist parts of history. Luckily this is not the case. I imagine
the presentation aims to bring in as many listeners as possible to an
otherwise serious history series. Written and presented by the
professional broadcaster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Carlin">Dan
Carlin</a>, these 5 well produced
episodes (totaling 8.5 hours) address the history of the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire">Mongol
Empire</a> in the 1200’s.
Starting with the later exploits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan">Genghis
Khan</a> and ending with
breakup of the empire at the hands of his great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>The podcast starts with a long introduction on how people view history
differently depending on how much empathy they feel for the people at
the time. In a well reasoned argument Dan suggests that the further we
get from events, the more disassociated we become and the easier it is
to reassess aspects of historical events without reference to the
suffering people experienced at the time. Thus it is hard to talk about
the Nazis without reference to their attempts at genocide. However,
Romans can be discussed without mentioning the devastation visited upon
the people they conquered (possibly genocidal in a few instances). The
Mongols seem to fall at the boundary of this change. In the west, the
Mongols seem quite distant. Although Dan recounts the story of his
Chinese university history lecturer admonishing him for failing to
consider the damage done to civilians in creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Mongolica">Pax
Mongolica</a>. Interesting
stuff, but perhaps an aside based on the author’s interests rather than
something integral to the story of the Mongols. Other than the fact they
killed an absolutely amazingly huge number of people. Comparable in
numbers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll">death toll from World War
2</a>, despite
the Mongol Empire forming in a time when the world population was much
lower and the methods of killing much more primitive. The Mongols of
Genghis Khan come across as quite a ruthless and expansionary people.
Dan Carlin suggests they saw all non-steppe people as subhuman. He also
points out that civilian atrocities in war had occurred many times
before (and since). The Mongols were exceptional only in scale.</p>

<p>The Mongol Empire starts with Genghis Khan uniting the tribes of the
eastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe">steppe</a> for the first
time. Previous steppe tribes had often harassed or conquered nearby
lands. In the west we talk about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthia">Parthians</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians">Scythians</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths">Goths</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns">Huns</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty">Turks</a> and others. In
Asia there is a similar list of other nomadic tribes - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">Great Wall
of China</a> was built
to try and keep them out. The Mongols were similar to earlier tribes in
that their armies were fast (consisting nearly entirely of light
cavalry), could live of the the land, and well-trained (steppe people
were taught to ride and fight from childhood). They differed from
earlier invasions as their armies were larger (drawing from many
tribes), well disciplined (the penalty for minor infractions was death,
the penalty for major infractions was death for you and your entire
unit), and well led. Genghis Khan is said to have a large network of
spies providing intelligence on his enemies. There are also many stories
of Mongol armies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Kalka_River">refusing battle until the battleground better suited
them</a>. They
were able to adapt their tactics to changing circumstances. The Mongols
learned siegecraft, successfully besieging many cities, and it is
believed they were the first to bring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mohi">gunpowder weapons to
Europe</a>, after learning of
them from the Chinese.</p>

<p>In the 13th century the Mongols probably had the most powerful army in
existence, and they used it regularly. In under a century they conquered
multiple kingdoms with relative ease to create the largest empire by
land area in history. They conquered two of the three Chinese kingdoms
at the time (the third was defeated a few years later by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan">Kublai
Khan</a> after the breakup of
the empire). They subdued the previously expansionary Central Asian and
Middle Eastern Sultanates all the way to the Mediterranean. An invasion
into Europe reached as far as Hungary. Apparently the Mongols had an 18
year plan to conquer Europe all the way to the Atlantic (they already
had spies in place). However just a few years into the plan, the Mongol
leader Ogedei Khan (Genghis’ son) died and the army had to return to
Mongolia for a new Khan’s election. It is an intriguing counterfactual
to consider events if Ogedei lived another decade, so the invasion of
Europe could continue. Europe was relatively weak and divided at the
time. It is hard to imagine there would have been more resistance than
in the east.</p>

<p>While the empire stayed united under a single Khan (Genghis, followed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogedei_Khan">Ogedei</a>, then Genghis’
grandsons), they suffered no serious military setbacks. The end of the
Empire came from internal divisions - the method of succession used by
the Mongols seems to have been a great cause of internal friction.
Although the transition from Genghis to Ogedei was smooth (as Genghis
made his wishes clear in advance), all the others were contentious.
Mongols used an elective monarchy - at the death of the previous Khan
all the relevant nobles convened to elect a new Khan. I can imagine this
worked well at the tribal level when all the possible leaders spent most
of their time close together. It doesn’t work so well for a continent
spanning empire. Take a look at a map - Hungary to Mongolia is a very
long way! After Ogedei, it took 5 years to elect a new Khan, as one of
the electors refused to attend, believing that the likely new Khan would
order his death. When the expected Khan,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyuk_Khan">Guyuk</a>, finally took command
he died soon after, leading to another 3 year span without a Khan.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongke_Khan">Mongke Khan</a> stabilised the
Empire for a while and even expanded a little, but at his death in 1259
the Mongol Empire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Mongol_Empire">split into four separate
parts</a>.
Thus ending this podcast series, but not the end of the Mongols. The
descendants of Genghis ruled much of Asia for centuries thereafter.</p>

<p>I could much more to write about this excellent podcast on an
interesting part of history (and a largely unknown to me). However, this
post is already long enough. Well worth a download and listen.</p>

    <p>Wow, nearly 3 months since my last post. That regular blogging <a href="/blog/2015/01/goals-4.html">yearly
goal</a> will definitely not be met. Although
the reason for the gap is all the work being put into meeting another of
those goals - completing <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games">Concealed
Intent</a>. Today marks a huge step
towards that goal - the ability to purchase Concealed Intent through
Steam Early Access. For those not familiar with Early Access, it is for
games that are not quite finished, but are playable, and which would
benefit from player community feedback. Concealed Intent definitely
qualifies.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently stopped playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: The
Gathering</a> in person. After a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/08/magic-the-gathering.html">brief spurt of
activity</a>,
I quickly slowed down to just playing the occasional pre-release or
other sealed tournaments, as much for the social event as the game.
However, over time my impression of the game has only diminished. It
takes too much time to play. Firstly there is the time taken to reach
the game store, then the time waiting for players to be ready to start.
If I get a return of one minute playing for two minutes waiting then I’m
doing well - often it is much worse!</p>

<p>Then there is the problem that many of the actual matches are just not
enjoyable. MtG relies on the concept of mana cards to act as a cost for
playing other cards. Unfortunately sometimes a player ends up with too
many or too few such cards (it is the luck of the draw) and as a result
might as well not be playing. In the “limited” games I tend to play
(“limited” format games do not reward paying extra for better cards, as
all the cards that can be played are provided to competitors at the
start) being “mana screwed” occurs to at least one of the players in
game roughly about 25% of the time. So around one in four of the games
are no fun (as I’m playing for the intellectual challenge, not to just
win).</p>

<p>So with increasingly little spare time, I decided to just stop playing.
But wait, what is this? A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">free-to-play</a> version of
the game is now available online! Maybe this will solve my issues.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/mtg_duels.png"><img src="/assets/posts/games/mtg_duels.png" alt="Magic Duels" /></a></p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Magic Duels (the online version of Magic) is a bit of a mess. I am quite
unimpressed. Some parts are as expected. The games are always standard
format (but with a small subset of the tabletop cards), so it could only
be expected that the game would try to sell you the extra cards. Magic
is probably the original pay-to-win game. The more one pays, the better
cards they will have and thus better chances of winning their matches.
This is carried over into Magic Duels - fair enough. It would have been
nice if there were some limited format games as well, but maybe they
will come later. At least they provide a mechanism to get the extra
cards without paying, but just playing a great deal over time. Still the
need to pay to be decently competitive rankles - and I won’t pay, so am
always playing from a position of weakness.</p>

<p>Being able to choose your cards has not helped the “mana screwing”
problem either. In fact in this game it seems to be even worse - at
least at the initial stages when a player does not have many cards. The
issue is amplified by the computer opponents having the most incredible
luck imaginable. They never seem to have mana problems and often draw
just the card they need right when they need it. Urgh. Of course it is
possible this is just good luck and normal variance, but if so I’m way
off into the land of many standard deviations beyond average. More
likely the developer has fixed it and gone a little too far. I wouldn’t
be surprised considering the numerous other issues with the game. It is
slow: my PC can run some of the latest 3D games smoothly, but it takes
20 seconds to start a 2D card game from the in-game menu? Something is
not right there. The UI seems to be built for mobile devices - it would
make much more sense if I had a thumb sitting in the bottom right
corner, but I don’t. This means that the time given to play instants is
barely enough to realise what is happening and drag you mouse across the
screen. Magic is not supposed to be a test of reflexes! As a competitive
game, it uses an online connection to maintain state and when this
connection can’t be established the game can’t be played. And the
connection has been down often. Very often. There have also been
numerous bugs, missing quests and other annoyances.</p>

<p>Annoying is a good term too describe this game. The mana issues and
problems have just reminded me of the flaws inherent in the original
game’s design. I get the feeling that it just doesn’t respect its
player’s time. I can’t imagine playing Magic live again, and after this
I probably won’t bother with the computer version either. Maybe its time
to give Hearthstone a try.</p>
