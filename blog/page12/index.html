<p>A new turn-based indie monster battler is in development. Does
<a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/beastmancer">Beastmancer</a> show promise? It
is still very early days (alpha demo!) and can only get better, but is
already looking great.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GazVGkOiq4o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>An important part of developing a game is gathering feedback on how it
plays. Sometimes this can be hard as an indiedev, and so the solo
developer of Beastmancer released an alpha demo free on IndieDB. In the
game the player collects fantastical beasts and then uses them in
turn-based battles against other beasts. Sort of like Pokemon, but more
JRPG’ish. The game is surprisingly playable considering its early stage.
And looks quite good with cell-shaded graphics and many animations
(although a few more in the fights are needed). There are a few issues
to be ironed out. Saving/loading does not work and there are long load
times (at least on my old’ish PC). The battles lack a certain oomph,
there are few special attacks and mostly it is just charge and bash.
Lastly, the story is too dominant and the maps too big, meaning that
there is little fighting and lots of listening/running around. I look
forward to seeing how it progresses.</p>

<p>Beastmancer is available for free as a PC-only alpha demo on
<a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/beastmancer">IndieDB</a>.</p>

<p>A mobile turn-based rogue-like that plays well on PC? Wonders will never
end with <a href="http://freeholdgames.com/">Sproggiwood</a>!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vY82qyTlDSc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Sproggiwood plays like a traditional
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">rogue-like</a>. Your avatar
explores grid-based dungeons in a fantasy world, fighting the denizens,
collecting treasure and levelling upto more powerful skills. What
innovation there is seems to be the result of its mobile origins. For
instance, after completing each dungeon the player resets - all
experience and collected items are lost. Each dungeon is started again
with a basic character… unless items or buffs are purchased through the
in-game store.</p>

<p>Luckily in the PC version, there are no microtransactions. So the worst
of mobile gaming is avoided. There is also a simple story and
replayability through unlocking extra character types (farmer, archer,
vampire, etc). Although there does seem to be some grinding required to
purchase enough buffs to get through the later levels. Overall this is a
well-made, polished and cutesy rogue-like, but it doesn’t offer anything
new to the experienced player of such games.</p>

<p>Sproggiwood is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/311720/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux
at US$14.99. It has been bundled many times.</p>

<p>Destroy the world that feeds you in <a href="http://www.greedcorp.com">Greed
Corp</a>, a casual turn-based strategy game that
plays similar to a RTS, but with a twist!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPAQXURV9Fo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Greed Corp the player is one of four possible factions fighting over
a hex map with height. The basic idea is to gather resources, construct
fighting units and defeat your enemies. The novel twist is that
extracting resources undermines the land, lowering it in height. If the
height of a hex falls too low, then it collapses - falling away into the
mists along with anything on it, gone forever. In practice this means
forces scurry across the map, leaving devastation in their wake before
engaging the enemy on what little of the map remains. Initially the game
works well.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the game often ends with one side clearly stronger, but
the map denuded of resources. Thus the game descends to a slow grind,
with one side destined for victory, but getting there at a lazy pace
while gathering the scant remaining resources. Later missions in the
campaign also have time limits on turn length, which I personally do not
appreciate (if I wanted such a constraint I’d play a RTS!). Still the
basics are enjoyable enough to keep a player entertained for several
hours.</p>

<p>Greed Corp is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/48950/">Steam
store</a> for PC only at US$9.99.

<p>Is it a game? Is it an experience? No, it’s <a href="https://www.stanleyparable.com/">The Stanley
Parable</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_OGgGZ9t_A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Superficially a first-person walking simulator, The Stanley Parable has
the player wandering around their abandoned office building - where is
everyone? While exploring, a voiceover addresses what the player’s
avatar is doing or thinking, often in a humorous manner. This narrative
is key, as it examines what it means to play games and what exactly it
means to be a player in such a designed environment. It is intended to
be played many times and has multiple endings, but a couple of hours
play will uncover most of them. Well-made, thought-provoking and funny;
The Stanley Parable is closer to an interactive art experience than a
game (in my opinion).</p>

    <p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p>After 6 months and 33 posts on this website I have learnt a little about
how much time it takes to maintain, versus the attention it garners. The
answer: a few hours per week of work for a handful of views. I either
need to massively increase the energy put into promotion (currently very
low), or decrease the writing effort. As this site is a sideline, it
will have to be less time writing. Especially since experience is
clearly showing that YouTube videos are much more popular.</p>

<p>Hence my new AGDP routine. I will try to make a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">Let’s Play review
video</a> of a
new game every week. I will still post up the video on this blog, but
instead of a full review (500-1000 words), there will only be a short
paragraph capsule review. For more information watch the video. This
should greatly decrease the effort required and allow me to get the post
up within minutes of publishing the video. These will be the main focus
of this website.</p>

<p>On an ad-hoc basis there will also be campaign play-through videos up on
my channel. At the moment I’m a third of the way through <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5jYoizlGig&amp;list=PLTLapARdhT1h7MLsPTmkMeyksgXdLMG1b">Tropico
5</a>.
Next I’ll probably do Homeworld or Rome: Total War. These campaign
videos will not be mentioned on the blog unless something particularly
notable occurs.</p>

<p>I hope (but no promises) to put up occasional design analysis videos
with a corresponding post. These will take a longer look at a game I
know very well and will critique the design, good or bad. I have enough
thoughts on Magic Duels, poker and Eve to get going. Now it is just a
matter of writing the scripts. Lastly, when I have time I might post
here about board games I’ve been playing.</p>

<p>So that is the new plan, let’s see how it goes…</p>
