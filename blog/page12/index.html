<p>Want to go on a fantastical adventure, unleashing magical mayhem as you
go? Well-made and fun, but way too fast for me,
<a href="http://www.magickagame.com/">Magicka</a> has you more than covered.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHyLusgWT9Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Magicka the player is a novice wizard out to save the world by
battling monsters. I can’t say much more about the story, because I find
this game insanely hard. After several hours of painfully slow progress,
I have given up. This is not because it is a bad game, just one that
requires fast and accurate keystrokes. Well into my middle-age, I do not
have the reflexes to play it well. The issue is that to cast a spell you
have to type a set of keys representing which of the 8 in-game elements
(water, fire, life, ice, etc) to include, plus a target, plus a optional
boost. There are various pickups in the game to add extra abilities (and
keystrokes) and special spells. There is tons of DLC and multiplayer
modes (including coop), but I didn’t try any of them. The gameplay is
basic monster fighting, largely on rails. However, the fights are quite
interesting and feel substantially different to each other. A big part
of successful fighting is working out the best spell combinations for
each fight/enemy. The story is also mildly humorous. A good game, but
too much button-mashing for me.</p>

<p>Magicka is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/42910/">Steam
store</a> for PC only at US$9.99.
It has been bundled.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.team17.com/games/alien-breed/">Alien Breed: Impact</a> manages
to create a tense isometric shooter game inspired by Aliens, but is
somewhat let down by controls.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qRK02RUOuZY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This top-down shooter scores top marks for evoking the feel of being
trapped on a failing spaceship infested with aliens. The decent but dark
graphics, irregular save points and long missions interspersed with
surges of aliens works well. However, a few things prevent this from
being a totally positive review. Mostly the problem is the controls! The
camera is positioned behind the player, so to move (and face) in the
opposite direction, the camera must be swung around by moving the mouse
to the edge of the screen. This is fine when nothing is happening, but
in the thick of the action while under heavy alien assault it can mean
temporarily facing away from the enemy in or to just see them properly -
very annoying and often lethal. Each of the 5 missions are quite long
(around an hour) and you often find yourself backtracking. Saving only
occurs at certain points which means significant progress can be lost on
player death - not sure if this is a bad thing or not (it certainly
ramps up the tension). There is an ok story line and a co-op mode. A
decent little game - not a great game, but definitely worthwhile.</p>

<p>Like transporting cargo across the galaxy? Well you are in luck, because
that is the entirety of better-than-it-sounds <a href="http://spacerun-galaxy.com/">Space Run
Galaxy</a>, with short, action-oriented tower
defense (huh?) gameplay.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e0Ei_ianteU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Space Run Galaxy you are a member of an intergalactic transport
company. Various organisations give you cargo of various sizes and
configurations to be moved to another star system. These are placed upon
your 2D hex based ship before starting the 5-10 minute journey to the
destination. Along the way you are attacked in tower defense style, with
waves of enemies coming in known patterns. Also like tower defense you
can place various equipment (guns, engines, repairers, etc) on your ship
to defend it and these then act independently of your command. This
gameplay loop is repeated ad nauseam. There is a campaign, but the
missions are all the same - move stuff. Items and ships can be levelled
up by the purchase of resources and then crafting improvements. The
issue is that resources stay where they were acquired unless moved (see
basic gameplay loop). This means the game can become a bit of a grind
with much time spend moving items around in order to progress. Or, you
could get other players to move them for you. This highly integrated
online component is limited to transport contracts, but means the game
requires a constant link with game servers - ensure you have a good
Internet connection! I’m not sure the extra missions available from
player contracts is worth it - they are all just the same as the
campaign missions and just seem like more of a grind. This game has a
good idea, well implemented, but has perhaps given up too much
single-player balance for its always online additions.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Another year, <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">another annual report</a>
on my <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/">Funding Circle</a> investments.
Events since last time have greatly changed the UK small business
environment (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit">Brexit</a>) and
Funding Circle have also modified their rules. As a result, it is likely
this will be my last report. Before explaining why, let’s see how the
investments performed.</p>

<p>Here are the returns for the last UK tax year:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.3%<br />
After Fees: 7.3%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 7.0%</p>

<p>Pretty good again - 7% much better than a bank, and about half the 2016
return on the UK stockmarket. Apart from a problem one year with bad
debt, the returns have been consistently decent and worthwhile.</p>

<p>So why could this be the end? It is becoming increasing hard to find
suitable loans. This started with the issues raised in the <a href="/blog/2016/04/funding-circle-results.html">last
report</a>, when the site
removed the loan auction system and replaced it with a fixed return
system. This means that loans fill up much faster - especially the less
risky or smaller ones. Thus when I check the site there are
substantially less loans available. For a while this was balanced by
large real estate loans that tended to take a few days to fill, but now
Funding Circle has decided to reduce their number as well. Perhaps this
change is due to Brexit risks? I’m not sure, but it would certainly make
sense to me. The risks of lending to UK business have certainly
increased in the sense the future is more uncertain. Do I really want to
lend to that small manufacturer for 60 months? I have found myself more
hesitant to lend - my required standards have increased.</p>

<p>Over the last year the money left unlent in my Funding Circle account
has steadily increased. Since such funds accrue no interest, as soon as
they reach a significant level, they are moved out to my bank account.
Then it starts to build up again. I just can not find enough loans to
join. By the end of the tax year the account was a third lower than at
the beginning. Again, it is already starting to rise after just a week
and there is a very good chance I will have a negligible amount left in
Funding Circle in another 12 months.</p>

<p>The original Portal was a FPS puzzler of near perfection, can lighting
strike twice with its <a href="www.thinkwithportals.com/?">sequel</a> When using
portals, definitely!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjMuAeHozF4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Playing this is as close to gaming perfection I have ever managed. I
found myself getting lost occasionally in the middle transitional levels - that is the only negative thing to say about Portal 2 - everything
else is praise. The FPS gameplay is super smooth. The puzzles are just
right. They take a little thought and make the player feel like a genius
once solved, but never get so hard as to cause frustration and
rage-quitting. There are lots of little extras and hidden features. The
story is entertaining. Glados is one of the best computer game villains
ever. The new character Wheatley is good too. It is actually a funny
game - a rare achievement. Seriously, if you haven’t played this, you
should. Don’t just take my word for it. According to Steam it has a 98%
approval rating and completion rate of 37% - a huge number (it is
normally under 10, my game has a completion rate of &lt;1). Highly
recommended.</p>

<p>Portal 2 is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux at
US$19.99.</p>
