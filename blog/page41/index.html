    <p>Most courses on <a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> tend towards the
technical or quantative (maths, science, engineering, etc). I imagine
this is partly because arts courses, with their writing based
assessments, are harder to grade online and the marking system doesn’t
scale well. However, there are a few around. I just finished <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ancientgreeks">The
Ancient Greeks</a> course
from <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/">Wesleyan University</a>.</p>

<p>Notably this course does not contain any written assignments - all
assessment is multiple choice. It follows the (so far) standard Coursera
structure. Seven weeks of online lectures (around 1.5 to 2 hours per
week), with mid-lecture quizzes and a multiple choice assignment each
week. There is an extensive reading list (all available free online),
but only once can I remember details in the reading being required for a
quiz question. The videos consist of a lecturer standing beside a large
TV displaying relevant images. The lecturer appears a little
uncomfortable in front of the camera, but otherwise production and
content quality is high.</p>

<p>With around 10 hours of lectures to cover <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece">ancient
Greece</a> upto
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socrates">Socrates</a>, the pace of history
is quite fast. Thus this course is a little introductory. An impression
confirmed by the very easy weekly tests. These multiple choice quizzes
give you the answers at the end of each attempt and can be attempted
three times without penalty. I can not see how anyone could get less
than 100% with a very small amount of effort. After
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer</a>, content is heavily focussed
on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars">Persian Wars</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta">Sparta</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens">Athens</a> and later the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War">Peloponnesian War</a>.
Unsurprising as these are the main players and events in the classical
period - and also the best documented.</p>

<p>This is a good short introductory course on (mainly classical) Greek
history with an especially good set of suggested readings. For a more
detailed history of ancient Greece pehaps consider Yale’s <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/12/clcv-205-introduction-to-ancie.html">CLCV 205:

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Last year I wrote a post on my initial experiences with Peer-to-Peer
lending through <a href="/blog/2012/06/funding-circle.html">Funding Circle</a>. I
initially got an 8.8% gross return, diminishing to 5.1% after fees and
losses. Now I have been using the site a year longer, so its is time to
update the returns. Over the last year Funding Circle has continued to
expand. The website has improved with a better design and tools (still
not sure about the secondary market though). There are many more loans
available (33 live at the moment) asking for more money (£2 million last
week). Anecdotally, this meant for most of the year the rates available
rose. Although they have fallen recently as more lenders and even the
<a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/about-us/our-blog/government-to-start-lending-to-businesses-through-funding-circle">UK
government</a>
join the site.</p>

<p>So, drum roll, the year’s results are:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.7%<br />
After Fees: 7.6%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 2.3%</p>

<p>Ugh, 2.3% is not a very good before tax return. However, still better
than any UK bank account. Those rates are calculated with the actual
cashflow entering my account. It is interesting to note that the Funding
Circle website says my gross rate is 9.2, but I can’t see how it
calculates that over a single year (unless it is including compounding
rates). Anyway, it is clear that the poor performance is due to bad debt - the recovery figure over the year is immaterial (0.04). None of my
loans are larger than 1.2% of total capital, and most are around 0.7.
The bad debt is made up of multiple defaults. Using the suggested bad
debt rates by loan rating on Funding Circle’s website, I calculated my
expected default rate at around 2 per year by volume (my portfolio skews
riskier than average). Over the year I saw double that and thus earnt a
rate far less than suggested. In Funding Circle’s defence the difference
in suggested and observed default rates translates into only a few
loans, so it is not statistically significant (yet). Interestingly the
bad debt seems to arrive in two waves roughly 6 months apart - one at
the end of summer, and another at the end of the tax year.</p>

<p>After these results I won’t be putting any more money into Funding
Circle over the coming year, but neither will I be taking any out - I’ll
give the system another year.</p>

<p>Postscript: In the last few days and after the above calculations were
made, one of the defaulted loans was “recovered”. This resulted in a 61%
loss on the original loan amount becoming a 39% loss, with no chance of
further recoveries. Better than a poke in the eye I suppose. Had it
occurred a week earlier, this event would have made the final return
2.5%. Instead it will provide a boost to this year’s return - see the
next update in 12 months time!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>We just had our first long weekend trip in Malaysia. We travelled to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malacca_City">Melaka</a> (also known as
Malacca) over the Easter holiday. At least it was a holiday for us
working for a UK organisation, as the Christian festival is not a public
holiday in Muslim Malaysia. Thus we erroneously thought it would be
quiet. Instead, the town was full of people - apparently it was the last
weekend of the mid-term school break and anecdotally we were told many
people from Hong Kong come for the Easter weekend (although we couldn’t
confirm that).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/melaka.png" alt="Melaka" title="Melaka" /></p>

<p>Melaka is known historically as the capital of a powerful Sultanate and
then later a Portuguese, Dutch and lastly British colony before
independence. Now it is known for a sizeable Chinese population and
delicious Chinese-Malaysian food (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peranakan_cuisine">Nonya
cusine</a>). We also
discovered that there are two types of the very tasty
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laksa">Laksa</a> (soup with noodles) and we
prefer different types. While away we ate four meals a day - apparently
not uncommon. All the food was excellent, including the street food from
the main market (which despite notices stating otherwise, was open on
Sunday night).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/melaka_activities.png" alt="Nasi Lemak and Laksa" title="Nasi Lemak and Laksa" /></p>

<p>Time spent eating in Melaka is time well spent. There are also some
colonial ruins (the British destroyed most of the older buildings during
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleonic_Wars">Napoleonic Wars</a>), a
recreation of the Sultan’s Palace, and a few other tourist attractions.
We walked around these sites, but didn’t enter any. The town is a very
pleasant place, makes good use of its central river and is easier to
walk around than KL. Getting there on the bus from KL is cheap and easy
(13RM for a 2 hour trip leaving every 30 minutes). I can definitely see
us popping down for another weekend.</p>

    <p>For many years I have been a customer of GoDaddy for domain name
registration. All my domains have been registered through them since 2002. I’ve never been a huge fan. However, their online servicing
worked, I never needed support and the price was acceptable. So I stayed
with them out of inertia. I stayed despite the annoying cross-selling,
confusing discounts/offers, and despite the common bad support stories.
I wavered a little with the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/31/bob-parsons-godaddy-ceo-elephant-hunt_n_843121.html">elephant
hunting</a>
and the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16320149">support for
SOPA</a> (since reversed),
but laziness kept me a customer.</p>

<p>I have paid GoDaddy hundreds of dollars. No more. All my domains have
been moved to another registrar. The reason? They decided to stop
accepting my money. When trying to renew a soon to expire domain, the
result was always the same useless error message “Unable to process”. I
tried different cards (both of which I had previously used successfully
on their site), paypal, restarting the browser, restarting the PC and
trying again another day. Always the same error with no indication of
how to fix it. I looked to support - nothing in their online guide and
with phone support shut, I sent them an email. Over 24 hours later the
response was “we don’t know send us more details”. However, during the
wait I had checked Google. I was immediately reminded of all the bad
things about GoDaddy, plus a few things I hadn’t heard before. I also
discovered that their competitors had a better reputation AND were
cheaper!</p>

<p>So the solution was simple, take the hour required to transfer all my
domains and pay less! I think there is a business lesson here.</p>

    <p>Google Reader is the website I visit most often. The Reader tab is
always open on the leftmost tab of my browser. I check it second in the
morning (after my email) and periodically during the day, easily
spending an hour a day “catching up”. Since February 2008 I have read
over 250K posts from 97 feeds. I don’t use Twitter much, I find Reader
to be far superior.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">Now it is
closing</a>.
Why, why Google, why?</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A25VgNZDQ08" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Hitler, I feel you. I don’t want my news retweeted by Stalin either.</p>

<p>It is heartening to see that so many other people online feel the same
way. I understand it was a free service and that Google has every right
to do what they want with it. Although I never had the chance to <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/">not be
a free user</a>.
Still, the shutdown is incredibly disruptive. Now I am far more wary of
Google’s products. As are other people, suggesting this is a bad
business move for Google by decreasing public trust in their products.
See articles
<a href="http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-end-of-reader-what-does-it-say.html">here</a>,
<a href="http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/46028291791/digging-around-in-the-google-graveyard">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/utilities">here</a>.
Of course, I found all of those through Reader!</p>

<p>Now I am going through all the free online products I use and imagining
their disappearance. Most are unimportant - I wouldn’t care if they were
shutdown. However, there are a few that would cause me concern. A couple
of these are free Google services. I will have to research alternatives - just in case. I’ll certainly think twice about replacing existing
offline services with online ones.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’ve switched to <a href="http://theoldreader.com/">The Old
Reader</a> for RSS feeds. Just trying it out at
the moment. It is nothing fancy, a bit slow, but does everything I need.
So I will probably stay.</p>
