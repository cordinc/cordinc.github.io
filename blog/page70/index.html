I could not find a course website.</p>

<p>Professor Isabelle Pafford from <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/12/history-4a-the-ancient-mediter.html">The Ancient Mediterranean
World</a>
podcasts returns for another series of Ancient History podcasts. This
time a course on the Roman Republic given during Fall 2008 at <a href="http://www.scu.edu/">Santa
Clara University</a>. There are 19 podcasts - 1 is a
slide show video, but the others are audio only. Each podcast is around
50 minutes in length and around 50MB. In the audio podcasts there are
often references to slides that are not available online.</p>

<p>The course starts with the stories of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_of_Rome">Rome’s
foundation</a> along with
details of the surrounding area and people, which presumably influenced
early Rome. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Kingdom">Roman
Kingdom</a> is quickly passed
over (perhaps due to a lack of information on the era) for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman
Republic</a>. Most attention
is focussed on the Late Republic, with over half the lectures on the
period from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi">Gracchi</a> to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar</a> - around 133BC to
49BC.</p>

<p>These lectures are full of engrossing details. There is a bit of
historical timeline talk (on this date this happened and on that date
that happened), but the series is more about the life and times of
ancient Rome. For instance, there is often discussion of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursus_honorum">Cursus
Honorum</a> (a series of
military and administrative positions that provided a semi-formal
structure to a political career) and how it affected the way people
sought or achieved power. There was also a strong
<a href="http://www.roman-empire.net/society/society.html#clients">patron-client</a>
system, where a person’s power could, in part, be measured by the number
of clients/followers they had. Thus, manumission was common as freed
slaves were typically clients of their previous owner. There is also
some interesting consideration of which events are definitely known to
have occurred, the fixed-points of history, and those parts of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source">primary sources</a> that may
be apocryphal.</p>

<p>Professor Pafford can be an engaging speaker, and it is clear this is an
area she knows well. Indeed the extra colour provided as cracks began to
appear in the republic had me hooked. It was a classic fight between two
political parties, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimates">Optimates</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Populares">Populares</a> - modern analogies
are too easy to make. Although the ability to raise private armies and
the tendency of losers to be executed adds an epic scale to proceedings.
The final result may be well-known, with Caesar the unlikely Populares
triumphing - but I still raced through the last half-dozen lectures.</p>

<p>It was a good thing I did know what happened in the end, as the end of
the lecture series is missing (hint Caesar is assassinated and his
nephew eventually dissolved the republic, becoming the first emperor,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a>). I would guess that
around a half-dozen of the lectures are unavailable, mainly around the
mid-republic. At one point Professor Pafford apologises for losing some
lectures in a hard-drive crash. So I suppose their absence is
forgiveable. However, like the earlier Ancient Mediterranean podcasts,
there are numerous other production issues. The audio quality is usually
good, apart from a few notable exceptions. The video lecture is almost
impossible to hear, and the slides are small relative to the screen.
Another lecture on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Triumvirate">First
Triumvirate</a> is split
across two lectures because it sounds like the microphone failed (and
the second part is very quiet). There is also quite a bit of course
administrative talk (assignments, books, etc) - in one 40 minute
lecture, 8 minutes are spent on such course administration topics. At
least the class seem interested and ask some good questions. The
lectures are also presented out of order on iTunes. It helps to know a
bit of history to reorganise them from the titles.</p>

<p>Interesting history podcasts, again let down a little by production.</p>

    <p>I don’t like new year resolutions detailing plans to make yourself
better - I’m already great! However, I do like the idea of setting a few
goals. This year’s goals are fairly similar to last years, but a little
less ambitious:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 4 times a month. Fairly sure I
can do this with the
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/cordinc/managed-mt/mt-search.cgi?tag=Blender&amp;blog_id=1">Blender</a>
and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/cgi-sys/cgiwrap/cordinc/managed-mt/mt-search.cgi?tag=History&amp;blog_id=1">History
Podcast</a>
posts I’m planning.</li>
  <li>Only have 2 programming projects going at the same time. Reassess
projects every 3 months. The first two are: learning how to load and
animate blender models in a 3D graphics engine; and a secret
project.</li>
  <li>Complete 3 Blender models and write tutorials on them - the models
are a robot (to learn animation), a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopolium">Thermopolium</a>, and a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broch">Broch</a>.</li>
  <li>Maintain Queuesaurus and general ruby skills. Try to use Scala.</li>
  <li>Run 5km in 25 minutes. This is a bit ambitious.</li>
  <li>Decrease net ownership of physical goods</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Almost a year ago I wrote <a href="/blog/2009/02/new-goals.html">some goals for the new
year</a>. Now it is time for an assessment.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal: Improve Ruby skills. Result: Partial success.</strong> I’m not at
what I would consider a professional standard, but not far off it. I
gemify’ed my BBC weather library, but have since abandoned it as
keeping up with the BBC’s constant API changes was frustrating. I
use <a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queusaurus</a> even if no one else
does. I started another project, but it didn’t get far enough to
publicise.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Learn Scala. Result: Have done some, but not much.</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Learn Blender. Result: Near Success.</strong> I feel confident
enough about this one. I haven’t completed an ancient scene, but I’m
sure I could.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: Success.</strong>
Doing this slowly but surely - I own fewer things now than when I
wrote that goal, but not by much.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: 48 blog posts in a year. Result: 44 posts.</strong> I’m fairly
happy with that. Holidays and looking for a new work contract slowed
me down a bit.</li>
  <li><strong>Goal: Run 5km in 25 minutes. Result: Not even close.</strong> The less
said the better.</li>
  <li>On the stretch goals, all are still a long distance away.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think the main problem with achieving those goals was my tendency to
try doing too much. At one point (and continuing for a couple of months)
I had 6 programming projects on the go at once. Nothing progressed at
any pace over the last half of the year and that is what caused the most
slippage. Something to be aware of for the coming year.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Having just completed the process of forming a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_company">limited company
under UK law</a>, I found
myself frustrated by the number of steps required. In case I ever need
to do it again, or a reader does, I thought it might be useful to set
out the steps I took - hopefully I haven’t missed any! If it seems
overwhelming, various accountancy or specialist firms can do most of it
for a fee. Note, I am not an expert in this area, just someone who has
done it once and recorded the steps - there is no guarantee this is
completely correct.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First get the company formed. This will require a unique company
name, a business address, and directors’ details. Forming the
company can be done through <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies
House</a>, but I used <a href="http://www.companiesmadesimple.com">Companies
Made Simple</a> to get things
moving quickly. I recommend getting a Printed Certificate of
Incorporation - it is needed in later steps.</li>
  <li>In my business, clients require invoices to have a VAT number so
registering for VAT was my next step. If you don’t need a VAT number
straight away, you may wish to get a bank account first. Also, if
the firm’s turnover is less than £68,000, registration is not
required. There are a few other exemptions too, see more at the
<a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=m&amp;r.l4=1073863071&amp;r.l1=1073858808&amp;r.lc=en&amp;r.l3=1083126677&amp;r.l2=1083126673&amp;topicId=1083126677&amp;r.i=1077722988&amp;r.t=BLTTOOL">Business Link VAT
guide</a>.
I applied for registration online through the <a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC Online
website</a> (click register) - the details
required should be the same as for company formation. HMRC also runs
a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/start/schemes/flat-rate.htm">Flat Rate VAT
scheme</a> that
is worth investigating. If it turns out to be useful then applying
to join the scheme can be done at the same time as registering for
VAT.</li>
  <li>Get a bank account. This is quite important as many of the other
steps need either bank details or a good reason why there are none
(eg VAT registration). Most banks will require a Printed Certificate
of Incorporation. I can’t recommend any good banks, and you should
be aware that it can take longer than you think to open a business
account.</li>
  <li>Sign up to file company documents online at <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies
House</a> (click on File documents
online). Even if the information given during formation never
change, the company will still need to submit at least two forms a
year to Companies House to stay registered (annual return and annual
accounts). This is easy to do online. At the same time you can sign
up for the
<a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/coIdFraud.shtml">PROOF</a>
system to make it harder for fraudsters to take control of the
company by filing paper forms. However, be aware that once you have
applied for online access, Companies House will (physically) mail
some activation forms before you can file online.</li>
  <li>If the company will be paying anyone a salary or expenses
(directors’ expenses count) then you will need to sign up to PAYE.
This can be done up to a month before payment. Again this can be
done through the <a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC website</a> (click
register). From the employer’s perspective, I find PAYE a bit
complicated. You should learn about it yourself -
<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/intro/index.htm">HMRC</a> and <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=m&amp;r.l1=1073858808&amp;r.lc=en&amp;topicId=1073858787">Business
Link</a>
are good places to start.</li>
  <li>In the weeks after forming the company, HMRC should send you some
forms to register for Corporate Tax. These need to be filled in and
returned within 3 months of business activity starting. Filling in
the forms will require the firm’s PAYE, VAT details, and the
Memorandum of Incorporation (this should have been included as part
of the formation process).</li>
  <li>Insurance may be required and is probably a good idea anyway. My
business area requires Professional Indemnity Insurance, so I
organised this before beginning trading. There are many other forms
of insurance which may be useful - my firm also has Employers’
Insurance and Public Liability Insurance. <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=sl&amp;r.lc=en&amp;topicId=1075196424">Business Link have a
guide</a>
to help determine which forms of insurance may be required. I used
an industry specialist insurer, which wouldn’t be useful to most
readers, but I have learnt to shop around as different firms can
quote vastly different rates (often the most expensive is multiples
of the cheapest).</li>
  <li>I recommend signing up to submit VAT, PAYE and Corporate Tax forms
through the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC website</a>. It is quite
good and normally guides you through the process of completing a
form; facing a long paper form fills me with fear. Also, if VAT is
paid by direct debit (which can be set up online) HMRC will give you
an extra week to pay (this can be done for PAYE too). After
initially applying online HMRC will send activation codes through
the mail to complete the process.</li>
  <li>Profit!</li>
</ul>

<p>After that I advise you quickly sort out your accounts and construct a
calendar of regulatory/tax events. Remember, every 3 months a VAT form
will need to be submitted. Depending on payroll size, PAYE will need to
be paid monthly or once a year in addition to an annual PAYE form (P35)
and expenses form (P11D). Corporate Tax forms need to be submitted
annually, as do Companies House returns and accounts. Staying organised
and being able to quickly determine the financial position of the firm
is very useful. Since my business is fairly simple and having completed
a course on accounting at uni, I created a double entry book-keeping
system in Excel. If you don’t feel you have the knowledge to do this (or
the firm’s accounts are too complicated) there are various software
packages and accountants that can help - I can’t recommend any.</p>

<p>In general, the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC</a> and <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">Business
Link</a> websites are very useful and well
worth a look.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

    <p>Ah, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton</a>
pattern. It is used to create a single, globally accessible instance of
a class, preventing any further instantiations (so only one object of
the class can ever exist). When I first learnt about Singletons soon
after leaving university, I thought they were wonderful and used them
often. Now I think that they are often a very bad idea. Not because of
security concerns, as one person once suggested to me, but because I
don’t want static methods/classes hanging round (increasing global
state) or I later realise more than one is needed!</p>

<p>Once when creating a consumer website for a bank I needed access to
various pieces of bank information at numerous points in the code.
“There is only one bank”, I reasoned and made the class containing this
information a singleton. Then the bank acquired another two banks so my
design was broken and refactoring had to take place right before launch.
However, despite learning repeatedly from experience, I still find
myself creating more. I think this is due to laziness on my part. If I’m
short of time or feel that it is not particularly important, I fall back
on habit. Later, while refactoring I realise a better result could have
been achieved with some thought. For instance, if the global access of
singletons is a problem, perhaps using an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control">IoC</a> container (like
<a href="http://www.springsource.org/about">Spring</a>) to wire everything up could
help.</p>

<p>I hereby resolve not to use Singletons without thinking very hard first
about whether there is a better way.</p>
