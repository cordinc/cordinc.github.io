  <div class="content">
    <p>This week saw a visit to <a href="http://www.harwoodarms.com/index.htm">The Harwood
Arms</a> - a gastro pub in Fulham,
recently awarded a Michelin star. It is round a few corners from Fulham
Road, on a quiet suburban street. From the outside the place looks like
a pub, but inside it is set up like a restaurant. Apart from the bar and
a small sofa area, the entire floorspace is occupied with tables. So I
can’t imagine your meal would ever be interrupted by casual drinkers,
although there is a quiz night every Tuesday.</p>

<p>The menu focusses on British produce with a special emphasis on game,
most of which is apparently hunted or caught by the owners. For a
starter I had a wild mushroom soup with mussel fritters. There was a
surprisingly large amount, although it was so nice it certainly was not
a problem to get through it all. The main dish was shoulder of deer for
two with celeriac mash, vegetables and a little salad. It all came on a
large platter so that you could carve the shoulder yourself. However,
this wasn’t at all arduous as the meat was so beautifully tender it just
fell off the bone. Again, a large amount of delightful food. After that
I was too full for dessert, but I’m assured the sticky toffee and date
ice cream with lemon curd was delicious.</p>

<p>The Harwood Arms had a pleasant atmosphere, not quite a pub but still
welcoming. Service was prompt and courteous. The cost was reasonable for
a top restaurant (by London standards!), dinner for two (starters, main
and one dessert) with wine was under £100. Excellent food and well worth
a visit.</p>

Podcasts</a></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> series examines theatre
during the time of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece">Classical
Greece</a>. In particular it
details the production of the world’s oldest surviving play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persians">The
Persians by Aeschylus</a>, first
performed in Athens at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Dionysus">Theatre of
Dionysus</a> in 472BC.
Like the other OU podcasts, this series is a set of short documentaries
to accompany lectures. There are 4 video podcasts totalling around 40
minutes in length, with the individual videos ranging from 7 to 14
minutes. They are available in iPod or a larger (640x360) format. There
are also transcripts. The visuals are mainly talking heads interspersed
with shots of theatre ruins, vases or in later episodes modern
productions of The Persians.</p>

<p>The first video details what the Theatre of Dionysus would have looked
like in the 5th century BC and what it would have meant culturally to
attend the theatre at that time. Performances would have been important
events, it is estimated that the theatre could probably hold around a
third of the male citizens of Athens (it is not certain women were
allowed to attend). The second video covers the actors and chorus in
Ancient Greek theatre. Ancient Greek plays only had 2 or 3 actors, who
would each play multiple parts while wearing masks. The next video
examines how some Greek plays have managed to survive 2500 years - only
7 of Aeschylus’ estimated 90 plays still exist. The last episode
discusses some modern interpretations of The Persians.</p>

<p>A good short podcast series, but probably only for people particularly
interested in Ancient Greek theatre.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>In another of my recent series of generic utility Java classes, I
present a multi-channel asynchronous throttler. My project connected to
an external webservice which imposed draconian restrictions if usage
went above a certain level - defined as whether there were more than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X</code>
service calls in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Y</code> seconds. I was determined to stay under this level.
Furthermore, some types of service calls were more expensive than others
and had their own limits in addition to the overall limit. That is for
certain types of service call I had stay under two limits - a call
specific limit and the overall limit that applied to all calls. I refer
to this as multi-channel throttling. Also, I wanted the throttler to be
asynchronous, that is I did not want to stop procesing while waiting for
the webservice to respond to my call. Looking on the web I found a
number of throttlers, but none that matched my multi-channel,
asynchronous requirements.</p>

Podcasts</a></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> series focusses on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acropolis_of_Athens">Acropolis in Athens</a>,
with special attention paid to its most famous structure, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon">Parthenon</a>. This is not a
series of recorded lectures, instead it is more like a documentary - and
would be viewed by Open University students as part of their course. It
consists of 6 short videos ranging from around 2 and a half to 6 minutes
in length. The whole series combined is under half an hour, so it is
just an introduction. The podcasts are well produced, easy to
understand. The video is clear and consists mainly of views of the
Acropolis in its current form (no CG recreations). There are two
versions available: an iPod version recorded in 320x176 ranging in size
from 13-32MB and a larger 640x360 version ranging from 26-68MB.
Transcripts are also present.</p>

<p>The first video introduces the site through the route of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panathenaic_festival">Panathenaia</a>, the
most important festival in ancient Athens. The following podcast shows
some of the buildings on the Acropolis other than the Parthenon. Then
the next three podcasts detail the Parthenon and its art
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon#Metopes">metopes</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon#Frieze">frieze</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon#Pediments">pediments</a>) much of
which now resides in the British Museum in London. The final video
concerns how to visualise ancient buildings from conventional plans
(<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/Parthenon-top-view.svg">here is the Parthenon’s
plan</a>) - an incongruous but interesting addition.</p>

<p>A professional-level, short, video introduction to the Acropolis and
Parthenon.</p>
