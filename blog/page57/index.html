    <p>TV news programs are increasing annoying me. Previously I have written
about their <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/news-junkets.html">disaster
junkets</a>, now I’m
ranting about their apparent need for argument. It is not so much a
matter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent:_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media">manufacturing
consent</a>
as manufacturing conflict.</p>

<p>Many Channel 4 News and BBC Breakfast broadcasts usually include at
least one segment where two people with opposing views discuss some news
item. I have also seen this on current affairs shows and Sky News - but
I don’t watch them often (to their credit I am not aware of this being
done on the main BBC news). It is claimed that they are promoting
discussion, but the impression is of a bunch of schoolchildren circling
the combatant and chanting “fight!”. Humans have an attraction to
conflict, and suggesting a controversy may gain viewers. Certainly such
an approach is prevalent on the Internet (witness
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin’s law</a>).
However, I hold news journalism to a higher standard than blogs (and I
think they consider themselves superior too). Perhaps the media is just
catering to baser instincts to fight for viewership in an increasingly
competitive news market.</p>

<p>These discussions rarely add any value to the topic at hand. The
participants are in opposition by definition (or they wouldn’t be
invited) and can’t be persuaded by a 5 minute TV confrontation. At the
rare best there is a reasonable logical exchange, although normally the
parties use all the non-logical weapons of rhetoric to win the debate.
Sometimes there is a heated argument and if the producers are lucky
enough to provoke a physical confrontation it can be covered as news
itself! Often the role of the news anchor in these segments appears to
be goading the participants.</p>

<p>There is the idea of journalistic balance, but this can be provided
without the need for argument. Instead “talent” seems more important
than reasonable, logical and most importantly truthful statements. A new
journalist once explained to me that an eloquent, presentable and
outspoken person is better “talent” - that is they come across well
onscreen. This is why the same experts appear on TV news repetitively
even to discuss areas outside their area of expertise. This is used to
advantage by politicians and PR people. Even today it is possible to
find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society">flat-earthers</a>. A
news discussion with them may imply opinions differ on the shape of the
Earth! Channel 4 often suggests viewers visit their website site after a
discussion for fact-checking. I find this strange because I watch the
news for facts, but they don’t have time to present them.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>

<p>When I first interviewed for a technology job in fixed income, I knew
the “basics” and explained how to do a discounted cash flow analysis to
price a bond. The interviewer smiled and said yes, that was the correct
way to price a bond, but that wasn’t how it was done in practice.</p>

<p>For the last six years I have developed software for the bonds desks of
Investment Banks (usually the European Government Bonds desk). Now it is
time to move on into a different business area. So I have decided to
write some notes on the business and software of bond trading as I have
witnessed it - starting here with the basics.</p>

or <a href="http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/podcasts/history/58-classics-in-discussion">Warwick University
Podcasts</a></p>

<p>This series provides a brief introduction to a number of current topics
researched or studied in the Classics department at <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/">Warwick
University</a>. The 10 audio-only podcasts are
in the format of an interview discussing the topic at hand. Episodes
range in length from 21 to 36 minutes. The production quality is
generally good, although on the “Graeco-Arabic Studies” episode the
audio cuts outs a couple of times. One of the episodes, “The Golden Age
of Islam”, is in Arabic so I was unable to understand it.</p>

<p>The podcasts range across a number of disparate topics. There is a
discussion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics">Numismatics</a> -
which for classical studies effectively means coins. Coinage was first
minted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia">Lydia</a> (in modern day
Turkey) around 650BC, and spread quickly. Coins were traditionally made
from valuable metals (gold and silver). However to be able to mint more
money, the coins were regularly debased. During the 3rd century AD the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">denarius</a> went from being 50%
silver to 1.5% silver. Another podcast (Medicine and Classicism in a
Comparative Perspective) looks at how medicine claims classic roots in
ancient works and commentaries, like those of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen">Galen</a>. Apparently Indian and
Chinese medicine have similar traditions. Old classical medical books
(and alchemy texts) were among the first texts translated into Arabic as
the classical world collapsed, as stated in the Graeco-Arabic Studies
podcast.</p>

<p>A quip during Drinking Parties in Ancient Greece podcast proposes that
classics is really just the history of drinking. This episode describes
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium">Symposium</a>; drinking
parties in ancient Greece. Apparently the dancing girls were regularly
in danger of being groped. The Sex in the Ancient World episode suggests
such dancers must have been disreputable women, as higher class Greek
women were neither heard nor seen. Homosexuality in ancient Greek
society is also mentioned. There is some debate as to whether the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty">pederastic</a> relationship in
ancient Greece was considered homosexual in the way we understand it
today or just a traditional cultural institution.</p>

<p>Other episodes deal with the role of logic in the renaissance; Roman
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegy">elegiac poetry</a>; and epic poetry
(subtitled “Homer to Virgil”, it could be retitled “Homer and Virgil” as
these are the only two poets mentioned). There is also a short biography
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a> while discussing
his autobiographical mausoleum inscription, referred to as the Queen of
Inscriptions. Apparently the original is now lost, but three copies
exist in modern Turkey.</p>
