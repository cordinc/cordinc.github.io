  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Over 10 years ago I did <a href="http://www.courts.dotag.wa.gov.au/J/jury_duty.aspx">jury duty in
Australia</a>. While
researching the legalities of writing about my experience, 90% of the
pages returned from a Google search were about how to avoid jury duty. I
can understand the sentiment. Dodging it was my first thought upon
receiving the letter announcing my random selection. However, work was
slow and my employer was ok with me being away for a week, so I decided
not to fight the summons.</p>

<p>I turned up at the District Court in the Perth CBD on the allotted day.
The couple of hundred jury candidates for that week were corralled
together and given a talk on our responsibilities and how the system
worked (just the standard stuff like there are 12 jurors on a case and
not to talk to anyone about your case). We were then told to wait until
our name was called and we left in groups of around 30 or so. There was
not much talking or socialising - it didn’t seem that most people were
happy to be there. I was called into the third group to depart. We went
into a courtroom and told the case was an assault and who the main
participants would be (so we could excuse ourselves if we knew any of
them). Then potential jurors were called to the stand, but about half
were rejected by the lawyers before they got there. No questions or
reasons were given for the rejections. The lawyers didn’t event look at
the jurors, they were head down in paper - presumably our details. My
name wasn’t called by the time twelve jurors were chosen, so I and the
remainder were led out of the court and back to the waiting room. I was
called into another group after a short wait, this was for a sexual
assault where most of the people involved had the same surname. I was
called but rejected and quite happy about it. After another short wait I
was called to a drug case, selected and not rejected. I was a juror.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be a 3 day case, but we started late on the first day
and finished early on the last day. Also, we (the jury) spent probably a
third of the time out of the court as the lawyers argued points of law.
The basics of the case were that the police were looking for a lost cat.
While searching they looked through the window of a house and saw what
looked like hydroponic equipment - it was also the house the cat was in.
They called in a special squad, entered the house (let the cat out) and
found the remains of a large marijuana cultivation operation. While no
actual cannabis was present, there were the remains of hundreds of
plants. All this was recorded on film, including the arrival of the
defendant who asked what was happening at his house. The defendant gave
a tour of the house on tape and talked (somewhat reticently, but without
being overly pressured) about how he grew drugs there, albeit with
little detail beyond describing what we could see.</p>

<p>The procecution case rested heavily on his video confession. They then
showed proof that the defendant actually owned the house, followed by
evidence that it was a drug factory producing commercial quantities of
cannabis. Finally, they said that even though no drugs were found, the
law allowed that all the used equipment was good enough for conviction
on the current drug cultivation charges. The defendant claimed personal
use for a wasting illness, though there was no mention of why he needed
so much. Then we had to decide. There was no overacting or histrionics
like in TV or the movies. Most of the time neither lawyer looked at us -
then were looking down at the notes the entire time, even when
questioning witnesses. Both lawyers were just doing their job. The only
time the process seemed to deviate from the banal, judging from the
lawyers slightly increased excitement level, is when they would ask for
us to be removed from the room. Or, maybe that was just me being
intrigued by what I was missing.</p>

<p>I don’t remember the details about any of my fellow jurors. They were a
bunch of average people, no one really stood out as unreasonable. When
we got in the room we first did an anonymous vote - about eight or nine
of us (including me) voted guilty. After the vote we talked and it
seemed no one was particularly keen to convict, but some people looked
harder than others for a reason not to. At first the question was
whether growing marijuana should be a crime at all. The scale of the
operation won that argument fairly quickly. No one believed the personal
use story. However, if there was only a couple of plants I think he
would have been found innocent as the majority of us backed this view.
Next there was the argument he was a patsy. Conspiracy theories
abounded. I had some sympathy with these - the case wasn’t quite right
and the constant requests for us to leave the room had made us all feel
we were missing something. The defendant did not come across as a smart
or rich man, yet had a second house full of drugs. There must have been
other people involved. Also where did all the drugs go? The operation
was supposedly shutdown a few days or few weeks before the police found
it. Some people even thought the cat story was a bit fishy and the
police were in on the whole thing.</p>

<p>In the end the video won all arguments. The tape had no edits as far as
we could tell, and showed the defendant from the time he first
encountered the police. After some identification, warnings about
getting a lawyer then without any more coercion than a few strongly put
questions, he completely confessed. We watched it a couple of times,
then the holdouts agreed to convict. There may have been a group of
people involved, but the defendant was definitely one of them. The
decision took a couple of hours. When we presented our verdict to the
court the judge thanked us and said that the result was completely in
keeping with the evidence presented to us. So what was the evidence not
presented to us? We were led out of the court building immediately and
didn’t see the sentencing.</p>

<p>I never saw or spoke to any of the other jury members again. I checked
the papers for a few days afterwards to see what happened, but couldn’t
find anything that seemed like my case. My main memory of the experience
was boredom. We spent most of the three days waiting. The case itself
was interesting, but the lawyers belaboured their points. I assume they
wanted to be certain we understood what they were saying. The whole
thing could have been done in a couple of hours if succinctness was
prioritised. Still, if that was a stereotypical jury experience I
wouldn’t have an issue doing it again.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is: never admit guilt on camera!</p>

<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/05/myth-at-the-heart-of-the-roman.html">Myth</a>
series, these podcasts look at how
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Rome">Rome</a> (together with its
port colony <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia</a>) was
built and functioned. There are 14 videos in the series and one
introductory audio podcast. The podcast files are prefixed with
non-contiguous numbers, so I think that the released episodes are only
part of a larger series. The videos are in documentary format with shots
of a large model of Rome for context interspersed with contemporary
scenes of the sites and talking heads. The podcasts range from under 2
minutes (12MB) to over 11 minutes (128MB) all recorded at 640x480
resolution, or a smaller iPod optimised format. Transcripts are
available in PDF format.</p>

<p>The videos can be split in three rough categories. There are episodes on
Rome: how it was constructed,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_aqueduct">aqueducts</a>; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian_Walls">Aurelanic
wall</a>; how the population
was fed; the water system; and some industry, mainly fulleries. Then
there are some podcasts on Ostia, its warehouses,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">insulae</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermae">baths</a>. The last videos focus on
a couple of Rome’s monumental buildings, namely the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome">Pantheon</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baths_of_Caracalla">Baths
of Caracalla</a>.</p>

<p>At its peak, Rome had a population of around a million people - the
largest western city in history until London and Paris in the 18th
century. The Romans were not known for their invention, but they were
good developers of existing technology and very organised. To maintain
the large population aqueducts were used to bring in water, while sewers
took the waste out (although urine was used in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullo">fulleries</a>. Grain and other goods
were transported up the Tiber on barges from Ostia after arriving there
from around the Mediterranean. Only the rich could afford horses and
carts were banned in Rome during daylight. Thus the size of the city was
dictated by walking distance. To fit the large population the city had
to built upwards. Many people lived in apartment blocks called Insulae
(which means “island” in Latin). Upto six stories tall, the better
apartments were at the bottom, as these were nearer the water supply,
involved less stairs and were safer in the event of a fire.</p>

<p>The standard Roman building method used thin bricks combined with
concrete. This technique allowed them to build strong buildings. The
Baths of Caracalla is a massive building able to serve thousands of
bathers at a time. It had a large dome over the caldarium (hot room),
underfloor heating and furnaces and large windows (unusual in older
buildings). The Pantheon at a diameter of 43 metres is still the worlds
largest concrete dome. It is constructed using marble from all over the
world - publicly demonstrating the Emperor’s power. The portico’s 12
metre tall columns are each from a single block of stone quarried in
Egypt. Peculiarly, if the columns were 15 metres tall then the portico
would better integrate with the rotunda. It is theorized that the
columns were originally supposed to be taller, but that it was too
difficult produce and transport such columns to Rome - thus
necessitating the mismatch between portico and rotunda.</p>

<p>Many interesting details on the functioning of a Roman city -
recommended.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>After some previous work <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/08/java-nio-server-example.html">building Java NIO
servers</a>,
there was still some question over the performance of the system
created. Here are the results from a number of tests I ran, to see how
such a server would handle connection and message storms.</p>

<p>The code from the previous blog article was modified so that there was a
single-threaded selector to handle initial connections, but it handed
off the message processing to a number of other selectors running in a
thread pool. All of the tests were run on my 4-core Win7 64-bit desktop
(full <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/01/building-a-new-pc.html">specs
here</a>). All
programs (both client and server components) were run through
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> Helios using JDK1.6.0.24, always with
256MB of heap space and no other VM options set. The code is not (yet)
available online, but it shouldn’t be too hard to work out a rough
understanding from the previous article and some Java NIO knowledge.</p>

<p>Firstly, I wanted to check the system could handle a storm of
connections. The test code would fire off 10,000 connections either: 1
per millisecond; as fast as it could in 1 thread; or as far as it could
with 5 threads sharing the load. The average time to reach various code
points were recorded and results are in the table below. The Accept
column is the time from when the connection is first received by the
server to just after the server accepts the connection. The Server
column is the time from when the connection is first received by the
server until it completes all actions on the connection - this is the
Accept column plus time spent initialising message processing. The
Client column is the time from when the client opens a connection until
it receives notification it is ready. Also during these tests I tracked
heap usage and it barely budged - an extra few MB on a system that was
already using 30MB after initialisation. All the heap gain was reversed
after the next GC. No problems there.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Connection Speed</th>
      <th>Accept (ms)</th>
      <th>Server (ms)</th>
      <th>Client (ms)</th>
      <th>Client Max (ms)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Sequential throttled</td>
      <td>0.15</td>
      <td>0.68</td>
      <td>0.19</td>
      <td>1.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sequential unthrottled</td>
      <td>0.07</td>
      <td>0.48</td>
      <td>3.90</td>
      <td>507.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 Threads unthrottled</td>
      <td>0.07</td>
      <td>0.51</td>
      <td>31.83</td>
      <td>510.22</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />As can be seen the Accept and Server times are fairly steady (I
would guess 0.07 milliseconds is the fastest a selector can accept a
connection on average). However, the faster the connections are created,
the greater the lag at the client. No connections were dropped. I
imagine the client delays are caused by some queuing. Possibly in the
PC’s networking, but more likely in the wait before the selector starts
processing the connection. In all the above tests the selector wait time
is 1 millisecond, so the server will not wait long for a connections. I
tried setting the wait time to 0, but some connections were then
dropped. I also increased the wait time, and unsurprisingly this only
increased the response time.</p>

<p>Speeding up the server code after the accept (ie, trying to decrease the
Server column) could speed up acceptance by decreasing the time before
the server is ready to process the next connection. This code could be
moved into another thread, but then I’m not sure what would happen if a
message arrived on a connection that hadn’t finished. I also looked at
the cost of selector creation by having each connection create a
selector just for itself. In this scenario the time taken increased, but
more importantly the server crashed having run out of heap after 641
connections (the old generation filled up). I would estimate that each
selector requires around 0.25 MB of heap.</p>

<p>Next to test the message processing. The client created 10,000
connections and once they were accepted each connection sent 10 message
(for a total of 100,000 unique messages). The server just reflected the
message back to the client. The client checked each message returned
from the server was as expected (all messages were present and correct)
and recorded total time taken. The variables in the tests were the
number of selectors processing messages and the number of threads
handling those selectors. The results are below. During all tests the
heap didn’t grow to more than 55MB (from a 30MB base).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/nio_messages.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The rule seems to be that the more selectors the better and there should
be roughly the same number of threads as selectors (it may be easier to
see in the raw numbers). More threads than selectors does no good at
all. I checked a few points further out, 7 selectors/7 threads and
10/10. They were quicker on average, but showed decreasing returns as
they were both 1.26 milliseconds on average. However, the standard
deviation also grew to around 2ms, when for all the other tests it was
around 1ms (perhaps due to the extra thread scheduling in the VM)</p>

<p>This such a system should handle connection and message storms short of
a concerted
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DDOS</a> attack.
For performance the rule seems to be pre-build as many message handling
selectors as you wish and then provide about one thread per selector to
support them.</p>

  Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Java.html">Java</a>, 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Technical.html">Technical</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">Serialization</a> is a useful
feature built into Java. It converts objects into a bytestream that can
be saved to a file or transmitted over a network and then reconstructed
later into the same object (perhaps in a different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine">Java
VM</a>). The basics are
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization">detailed
here</a>,
with some more <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/serialization/">advanced features
here</a>
and the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/platform/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html">complete API is
here</a>.
Despite all this documentation, I recently came a across a problem not
described. What if an object being deserialized requires a reference to
some non-serializable object in the<br />
application. That is how can an object be reconstructed when it contains
part of the application’s context that can’t be serialized. For
instance, what if the object has a network connection as a member
variable. The network connection can not be meaningfully serialized, so
when the object is deserialized it has somehow reconnect itself to the
network, which requires some reference to the network context. This may
sound like a contrived example, but it occurs in the <a href="http://www.reddwarfserver.org/">Red Dwarf
Server</a> (previously known as Sun’s
Darkstar project) where network connections are transparently moved
around a server cluster.</p>

<p>The best way to solve this problem is to ensure that the serializable
objects are self-contained and do not need any outside context when
deserialized. Let’s assume that is not possible and move on. Next best
is to hook the object to its required context immediately after the
deserialization. However, this may not be practicable because the
deserialized object is not easily accessible (for example, if it is deep
in an object graph - which is the case in Red Dwarf and my code).</p>

<p>Red Dwarf solves the problem by defining a static accessor on the
context class and then on the serializable object adding a serialization
override method like the below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">readObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">ObjectInputStream</span> <span class="n">in</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">Exception</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">in</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">defaultReadObject</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">contextObject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getContextObject</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This solution works, but I don’t like it. Creating a static context
makes it hard to write tests and add a second context if required (I
have been caught out by this before). It could improved by making the
static context use
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html">ThreadLocal</a>
storage, but there are other ways.</p>

<p>Checking out the <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Core/io-nio/java/io/ObjectInputStream.java.htm">Java serialization source
code</a>,
I thought there may be some way of extending the deserialization
process. The main extension points seem to be the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">readObject(ObjectInputStream in)</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">writeObject(ObjectOutputStream in)</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">readResolve()</code> methods added to the serializable object. These are
found by reflection on their signature in a private method and can not
be changed. There is a method <code class="highlighter-rouge">readObjectOverride()</code> on
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readObjectOverride()">ObjectInputStream</a>,
which allows a bespoke deserialization process to be defined. However,
so many of the methods on ObjectInputStream are private that this would
be like writing a new process from scratch.</p>

<p>There are two other options. The ObjectInputStream can be subclassed and
contain a reference to the context object. This new class can detected
within <code class="highlighter-rouge">readObject(ObjectInputStream in)</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">instanceof</code> and the
context dereferenced. An alternative is to keep the subclass of
ObjectInputStream and set <code class="highlighter-rouge">enableResolveObject(true)</code> in the constructor
(this requires the program to have security permission). This means that
after deserialization the <code class="highlighter-rouge">resolveObject(Object obj)</code> method on the
stream subclass will be called and the return value passed as the final
result of the deserialization. Thus this method can perform extra
initialisation or even replace the given object with a different one.
The code below shows both these techniques - you probably only want to
use one at a time.</p>
