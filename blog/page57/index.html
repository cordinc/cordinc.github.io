  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">Serialization</a> is a useful
feature built into Java. It converts objects into a bytestream that can
be saved to a file or transmitted over a network and then reconstructed
later into the same object (perhaps in a different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine">Java
VM</a>). The basics are
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization">detailed
here</a>,
with some more <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/serialization/">advanced features
here</a>
and the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/platform/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html">complete API is
here</a>.
Despite all this documentation, I recently came a across a problem not
described. What if an object being deserialized requires a reference to
some non-serializable object in the<br />
application. That is how can an object be reconstructed when it contains
part of the application’s context that can’t be serialized. For
instance, what if the object has a network connection as a member
variable. The network connection can not be meaningfully serialized, so
when the object is deserialized it has somehow reconnect itself to the
network, which requires some reference to the network context. This may
sound like a contrived example, but it occurs in the <a href="http://www.reddwarfserver.org/">Red Dwarf
Server</a> (previously known as Sun’s
Darkstar project) where network connections are transparently moved
around a server cluster.</p>

<p>The best way to solve this problem is to ensure that the serializable
objects are self-contained and do not need any outside context when
deserialized. Let’s assume that is not possible and move on. Next best
is to hook the object to its required context immediately after the
deserialization. However, this may not be practicable because the
deserialized object is not easily accessible (for example, if it is deep
in an object graph - which is the case in Red Dwarf and my code).</p>

<p>Red Dwarf solves the problem by defining a static accessor on the
context class and then on the serializable object adding a serialization
override method like the below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">readObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">ObjectInputStream</span> <span class="n">in</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">Exception</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">in</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">defaultReadObject</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">contextObject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getContextObject</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This solution works, but I don’t like it. Creating a static context
makes it hard to write tests and add a second context if required (I
have been caught out by this before). It could improved by making the
static context use
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html">ThreadLocal</a>
storage, but there are other ways.</p>

<p>Checking out the <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Core/io-nio/java/io/ObjectInputStream.java.htm">Java serialization source
code</a>,
I thought there may be some way of extending the deserialization
process. The main extension points seem to be the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">readObject(ObjectInputStream in)</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">writeObject(ObjectOutputStream in)</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">readResolve()</code> methods added to the serializable object. These are
found by reflection on their signature in a private method and can not
be changed. There is a method <code class="highlighter-rouge">readObjectOverride()</code> on
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readObjectOverride()">ObjectInputStream</a>,
which allows a bespoke deserialization process to be defined. However,
so many of the methods on ObjectInputStream are private that this would
be like writing a new process from scratch.</p>

<p>There are two other options. The ObjectInputStream can be subclassed and
contain a reference to the context object. This new class can detected
within <code class="highlighter-rouge">readObject(ObjectInputStream in)</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">instanceof</code> and the
context dereferenced. An alternative is to keep the subclass of
ObjectInputStream and set <code class="highlighter-rouge">enableResolveObject(true)</code> in the constructor
(this requires the program to have security permission). This means that
after deserialization the <code class="highlighter-rouge">resolveObject(Object obj)</code> method on the
stream subclass will be called and the return value passed as the final
result of the deserialization. Thus this method can perform extra
initialisation or even replace the given object with a different one.
The code below shows both these techniques - you probably only want to
use one at a time.</p>

    <p>It was always my plan at university to do honours - it was a step on the
way to a PhD. The Computer Science degree at <a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/">The University of Western
Australia</a> was nominally a three year degree,
but a small number of students with good grades were invited to do a
fourth year in order to graduate “with honours”. I got the required
grades and thus got an invitation to do the extra year. Fourteen other
students did the same out of a third-year class of just over 100. A few
good students who must have had invitations refused - I knew a couple of
them, including one who got very good grades. Although on the whole, the
honours class was representative of the better students in our year.
That year I worked harder than I ever had before (but have a couple of
times more since). I needed to achieve 1st class (the highest grade
available) to stand a good chance of getting into the PhD program. This
is the story of that year.</p>

<p>Like the previously reviewed <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/myth-in-the-greek-and-roman-wo.html">Myth in the Greek and Roman
Worlds</a>,
these podcasts are part of <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open University</a>
course <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a330.htm">A330: Myth in the Greek and Roman
Worlds</a>.
These podcasts examine how Rome represents its foundation myths through
a number of historical objects, ranging in origin from the classical
period to the 17th century. The series is composed of 10 episodes with:
5 video podcasts on specific artifacts; 2 audio and a video podcast
introducing or giving an overview of the topic; and, two audio podcasts
shared with “Myth in the Greek and Roman Worlds” discussing the role of
myth in the ancient world. The video podcasts are in documentary format,
normally showing a talking head or an object being described. The video
podcasts are all around 5 minutes long (50MB) and recorded at 640x360
resolution, or a smaller iPod optimised format. Transcripts are
available in PDF format.</p>

<p>The well-known story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_of_Rome">Rome’s
Foundation</a> is that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus">Romulus and Remus</a>
(descendants of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, a prince
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy">Troy</a>) were abandoned as infants,
suckled by a she-wolf and founded the city with Romulus killing Remus in
an argument over the exact location of the new city. There is apparently
some evidence of other slightly different foundation myths, where other
families take a more prominent role. The myth in its current form became
dominant during the reign of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a> who claimed ancestry
from Romulus. Augustus was adept at manipulating Rome’s foundation myths
to help consolidate power in himself and his family.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius">Suetonius</a> writes that as an
alternative to Augustus, Octavian was offered the name Romulus as the
second founder of Rome.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Augustus">House of Augustus</a>
is the first artifact examined. Presented by Augustus as a small
domestic building, its location was further reinforced his connection
with the gods and foundation myths. It is on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_Hill">Palantine</a> amid rows of
temples and close to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupercal">Lupercal</a>, where Romulus and
Remus were supposedly found by the she-wolf. In 13BC the Roman Senate
commissioned the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis">Ara Pacis</a>, an
altar to honour Augustus for bringing peace to Rome. It is the subject
of one of the podcasts and again links Augustus to the foundation myths.
The altar displays scenes of nature, Rome’s foundation and a religious
procession including the figure of Augustus himself. Augustus is also
connected to the last classical object investigated - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger">Lapis
Niger</a>. This artifact is a
number of black basalt paving stones covering an important shrine in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitium">Comitium</a> area of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum">Roman
Forum</a>. Although it is not
known what exactly the stones cover, it is know that the site is of
archaic importance in the city’s foundation.</p>

<p>It was originally though that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Wolf">Capitoline
Wolf</a> (the famous status
of Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf) was classical or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization">Etruscan</a>. However,
it is now known that the wolf statue probably dates from the medieval
period, with the twins added during the renaissance. Still the statue’s
image is plastered all over Rome as a symbol of the city as the
traditional seat of power, even in modern Italy. Many people have used
the foundation myths. In the 17th century the Popes had the d’Arpino
frescoes painted in the salon of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_dei_Conservatori#Palazzo_dei_Conservatori">Palazzo dei
Conservatori</a>
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Cesari">Giuseppe Cesari</a>.
These paintings are detailed in the last of the artifact podcasts. They
depict scenes in the foundation of Rome together with a large statue of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_X">Pope Innocent X</a>.</p>

<p>The artifact podcasts are interesting, but most of the others can be
skipped if already seen as part of a previous Open University course on
myth.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>On Thursday the UK held a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_alternative_vote_referendum">referendum on whether it should use the
Alternative Vote (AV) electoral
system</a>.
I didn’t hold much hope for an AV victory. While I believe AV is a
preferable over the current
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting">First-Past-The-Post</a>
(FPTP) electoral voting system, FPTP is ok and democracy generally runs
acceptably in Britain. It can be hard to get people out to vote on what
can seem like a minor issue and hard to get people to want change when
there doesn’t feel like a need for change. So with the political parties
split and voting voluntary, I expected AV to lose, and it did - by a
large margin. No problem. I’m not going to leave the UK over the
electoral system, at least not when there are so many other good reasons
to leave.</p>

<p>So what has made me care enough to write this, after the battle has been
lost? The day after the election I received a circular promoting the “No
to AV” campaign (good timing guys). There is an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/_mia/5660630645/">image of the circular
on Flickr at this
address</a>. The third
bullet point states that Australia wants to get rid of it’s AV-like
electoral system. I left Australia 8 years ago, and I still read the
Australia papers nearly every day. I have seen no mention at all of this - not from the press (even the Murdoch press) or friends. I can honestly
say I have seen infinitely more support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secessionism_in_Western_Australia">WA
succession</a>
(a fairly fringe position). After some investigation it seems that this
view is based on a single survey - <a href="http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2011/02/do-australians-really-want-to-abandon-the-alternative-vote.html">generally considered
flawed</a>.
I can’t imagine there will be a referendum on voting system in Australia
for many years. The rest of the flyer seems similarly dishonest. Many of
the points based on the assumption that the person who gets the most
votes is the “winner” and “best” candidate, which is clearly not true.
Such a person has a plurality by definition, but “best” and “winner” are
defined by the voting system used - which is the question at hand.</p>

<p>The reason I prefer AV is because it give a result more representative
of the whole constituency, rather than just the plurality. Ignoring the
possibility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">Proportional
Representation</a>
(which, to my mind, is a different argument entirely), if we assume
constituency based democracy, where one person represents an geographic
area, then it is better to have the person who most closely matches the
views of the majority of constituents (or at least those that vote). If
you disagree, well you are in the majority (in an election with only two
options AV and FPTP are effectively the same). I just wish that the
campaign to build that majority didn’t print bullshit.</p>
