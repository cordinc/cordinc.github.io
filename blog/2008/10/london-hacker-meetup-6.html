<h4>London Hacker Meetup</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>Last Thursday I went to the “London Hacker Meetup #6”. These events are
organised as a London analogue to the dinners held for <a href="http://ycombinator.com/&quot;">Y
Combinator</a> startups in the US, although
anyone could go along. Never having been to an Y Combinator dinner, I
can’t compare to the original, but I definitely found it an interesting
evening and more welcoming than the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/07/techcrunch-pitch.html">Techcrunch
Pitch</a> event.
It was held in the <a href="http://www.songkick.com">Songkick</a> offices in
Spitalfields (actually over the market) and drew a crowd of around 30,
mainly youngish guys in very casual clothing (there were I think 3
women). I felt quite old and conspicuous in my work shirt and trousers.
Luckily everyone was polite and friendly even after I told them I worked
at a bank.</p>

<p>There were four quick talks.
<a href="http://www.connectivelogic.co.uk/">ConnectiveLogic</a> demonstrated their
product to easily create concurrent programs without writing any
concurent code - interesting, but I’d have to have a play before saying
more. <a href="http://fuzzwich.com/">Fuzzwich</a> showed their online product to
easily create simple flash animations. It looked fun and having tried it
out since I can say it definitely works as advertised - give it a try.
Mary (can’t remember the rest of her name) spoke about her music
recommendation project, <a href="http://theperceptron.com/">The Perceptron</a>.
Finally, a guy presented his idea for a startup, then asked if anyone
was interested in joining him and applying to Y Combinator. I was
tempted, but thought it would be hard to commit to a company with
someone I didn’t know at all. Also, I’m more invested in
<a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queuesaurus</a> and would need a good offer to
move right now.</p>

<p>After the talks we decamped to the local pub. I spoke to a couple of the
Fuzzwich people for a while. They moved from San Francisico to London to
be near their customers. We discussed how to pay employers (not so
little they aren’t committed but not too much, they also said an options
“cliff” was standard - that is if you are sacked within the “cliff”
period, usually a year, then your options are cancelled). We also spoke
about motivation and starting a company, their advice was “do it!” They
seem like nice people. Later I spoke to a person who had an idea for a
startup; but not the technical knowhow to implement it. This seems like
a common problem, there seemed to be a few such people around. My last
conversation was with a guy I met at the Pitch event. He said that the
company that pitched had since shutdown - we talked a bit about founder
commitment and how important it is. He didn’t seem discouraged at all;
he is now interviewing other startups founders to see if they suit him
(definitely the right way round!).</p>

<p>I certainly left with the impression that there is still a great deal of
activity in the London startup scene, even as the financial IT world
significantly slows.</p>
