<h4>FOWA London 2008</h4>

<p>Last Friday I went to the <a href="http://london2008.futureofwebapps.com/">Future of Web Apps (FOWA) London 2008
conference</a>. As I only had the
single day off work I decided to get the expo only entrance (£5) rather
than a two-day full pass for nearly £400. Thus I didn’t get to see any
of the proper talks, instead I just walked around the floor to see the
booths and one “FOWA university” talk.</p>

<p>The talk was by <a href="http://www.yuuguu.com">Yuuguu</a> on how to run a company
when all employees telecommute. Apparently, the FOWA conference is the
first time all the Yuuguu employees have met at the same time. Most of
the talk was fairly bland and many in the audience were head down on
their laptops or iPhones. However, there were a few interesting points.
Yuuguu people don’t work if they meet in person, they consider the time
too important to waste on work and they bond instead. Also, every Friday
they get together online for virtual “beers”.</p>

<p>There were a couple dozen companies with booths. A few big names like
Microsoft, Sun and Myspace were there, but most were firms I had never
heard mentioned before. This caused some awkward experiences, as their
names normally give no hint as to their business areas. I would squint
at their posters trying to work out what they did (which often didn’t
help much either). Meanwhile some marketing person would creep up on me,
start talking and give me their <a href="http://www.moo.com/">Moo mini business
card</a> (these were literally everywhere). I left the
conference knowing what every exhibiting business did, but only about
half of them were marginally relevant to me.</p>

<p>The Microsoft booth was by far the best. Among the computers they had a
couple of Xboxs and a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface">Surface box</a> -
the Xboxs were empty while it was hard to see the Surface through the
crowd. Rightly so, it was an impressive machine. All that made me want
to code rather than talk and I left after an hour, skipping the
Diggnation filming - I saw it last year. Anyway if want you can see the
FOWA talks
