<h4>Rhetoric</h4>

<p>Logically bad arguments are annoying. It is almost as annoying when
people argue that a premise is clear when it is not. Often people make
assumptions about their argument’s starting points, perhaps to avoid
examining the implications of their premise. Sometimes this is done for
rhetorical reasons (they just want to win an argument - politicians seem
particularly guilty of this). Other times it appears to be due to a lack
of thought.</p>

<p>That small rant was prompted by a segment on breakfast TV about
performance-enhancing drugs. The premise was that performance-enhancing
drugs were unfair and how hard they were to detect. Why it was unfair
was never examined. The situation may well be unfair, and being a fan of
cycling I mourn the damage drugs have done to that sport. However, what
caught my attention was the background of the presenter. He was a UK
Olympic gold medallist in rowing. Many people would consider such a
person eminently qualified to talk about fairness in sport. I would not
be so sure.</p>

<p>One of my earliest memories of the Olympics was watching the cycling
team time trial, a 100km 4-member team race against the clock. The
competitive teams were on the latest expensive bicycles costing
thousands and had been in intensive high-tech training camps to ensure
their best performance. Then the Ethiopian team was shown. Their bikes
were clearly of a much older and cheaper design - lacking all the
aerodynamic finery necessary in modern cycling. They had no chance in
the race. Is it unfair that the Ethiopians were not as competitive as
others because they had worse technology? Is it unfair that having more
money spent on an athlete (in support, training, a high-tech bike or
better boat) makes them more likely to win?</p>

<p>It may be possible to say that the best athlete at the start of the
competition has the best chance of winning. However, drugs and money
give a distinct and often insurmountable advantage before the
competition begins. Drugs and money distort the playing field from the
very start and always have. The breakfast TV presenter benefitted
greatly from this situation. While people suggest a complete ban on
performance-enhancing drugs for the sake of fairness (at least on this
breakfast TV show), there is no similar call for fairness in money. It
could be argued that money fairness is impractical and could not be
enforced, but that’s not the point (incidentally HGH use can’t be
detected and thus its ban can’t be enforced at present).</p>

<p>If fairness is defined as all have the same chance of winning at the
start, then competitive sport is inherently unfair. I’m not sure that is
a bad thing - I certainly don’t have a problem with it. The best have
advantages (I haven’t even touched on the concept of genetic unfairness)
and that should just be accepted, it is the nature of the competition. I
would prefer to see a different argument against performance-enhancing
drugs.</p>
