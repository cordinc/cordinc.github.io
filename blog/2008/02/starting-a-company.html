<h4>Starting a company</h4>

<p>Since being at uni and becoming properly aware of the working world, I
have wanted to start a company. It has often seemed to me that the
cutting edge interesting paid work in my field is happening in startups
(by stating paid work I’m excluding open source and academia). Perhaps
that is a naive view and all jobs involve shovelling large amounts of
crap, still I believe shovelling your own is preferable to someone
else’s. I’ve tried the more traditional career route. For a few years I
even considered climbing the corporate ladder. I got an MBA and poked my
head into the bottom level of middle management at a large firm and
quickly scurried back down again - it is definitely not for me.</p>

<p>I’ve come close’ish to a few startups. During the MBA I talked about
starting a company with another student, but our investigation suggested
it would never be more than a hobby company (I still believe correctly).
Later, while working at a small consultancy I tried to persuade the
directors to become a product company, but they considered the risk too
great for the returns compared to their current business. Before coming
to London I actually pitched an idea to a few friends who had talked
about starting and they pitched an idea back. It went nowhere, they said
my idea was too big (an open platform for online worlds) and I thought
their idea too small (casual games for ebook readers). Also, it was just
after the dotcom crash was beginning to bite and everyone was extremely
aware of that risk/reward payoff. Two of the people who pitched those
casual games actually started a company,
<a href="http://www.dogmelon.com.au/">dogMelon</a>, although I don’t believe they
ever quit their day jobs.</p>

<p>Since moving to London the startup goal has receded. I haven’t met
anyone here who is seriously interested despite exploring a few ideas
over beers. I used to be of the belief that if you could not convince at
least one other person your idea was good enough to join you, then the
idea probably wasn’t very good. Now, I’m not sure I care. After many
years contracting in London I’ve built up a bit of a financial cushion.
I’m comfortable and have no dependents. I still want to try creating
something and this is about as good as its going to get. I feel its
worth starting by myself (perhaps something small) and just seeing what
happens. I should at least learn more about what it involves and whether
I want to continue.</p>
