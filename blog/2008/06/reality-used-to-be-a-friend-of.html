<h4>Reality used to be a friend of mine</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>I was reminded recently that sometimes managers can wilfully ignore the
reality that they work with humans rather than machines. Some examples
from my past workplaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At a large well-known consultancy a manager used Microsoft Project
to estimate the elapsed time of a project at 6 weeks. I thought that
was impossible given the estimates for individual tasks in the
project (which I had a part in determining). The manager assured me
it was all fine because he just put the tasks into Project and that
was the date that came out. I asked to see the Project data. It
turned out that he had assumed that all people in the project would
work on the project for 5 days a week, no holidays or time off.
Problem was the project started on the 1st of December! He had
ignored Christmas, New Years and all the holiday time that people
had already booked. In the end the project was several weeks late
according to the original finish date. However, after taking the
holidays into account the project was on time, but the client
thought we were hopeless anyway because even after pointing out his
error the manager had still shown the client his original
unrealistic date!</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li>At a different firm it was generally accepted that a rota was
required to fairly apportion weekend work. The manager would assign
each weekend to a team member in turn. So who would do the first
weekend, just a few days away? Well, the person who was currently
out on holiday for the next couple of weeks of course!</li>
</ul>

<p>And just to show it is not always the managers. I was doing a short,
tactical project for a couple of financial markets’ traders (consider
them very important users). One Monday I deliver the project and they
are immediately unhappy - “unworkable and obviously wrong” they say. I
return to my desk and work on their fixes. On Tuesday I give them the
next version - “what are you thinking, worse than before” they say. I
sit down with them and they give me a 10 minute lecture on how they see
it working. I leave with a good understanding of what they want. For
Wednesday’s version they say, “perfect, why couldn’t you do this the
first time”. Only thing was I just gave them Monday’s version again!</p>

<p>Of course my lips are sealed on my stupid mistakes.</p>
