<p>I reached a milestone in my project progress yesterday. I have just put
a very crude version of my app out for alpha testing. Unfortunately this
is three weeks later than I had originally planned back in January. At
that time I was hoping to do an alpha release over the Easter holiday.
About half the delay is due to problems with the place I decided to host
the app, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. My app seemed to screw up
their import system and for days I could do nothing. It also seems a bit
slow - noticeably slower in production mode than my old laptop in
development mode. When I get to beta testing I’ll probably move to a
different host. I can’t complain too much, as their service is free and
in beta. They are definitely worth checking out for small developments
or hosting.</p>

<p>The other half of the delay is caused by the time taken for my
expectations to return to their original level. Over the last three
months my ideas on what the app should do have expanded greatly, and
that week of delay was me trying to add some last minute features. I
could have kept going forever before releasing anything. Ultimately I
decided it would be best to get something out even if I knew it was a
crappy bare minimum. I hope my alpha tester will persist through some
trying times, but right now I need a little direction. The app is
definitely not as easy to use as it needs to be and I suspect the design
is atrocious. The plan is my alpha tester will help direct me to the
areas that need most attention, and guide me away from those that are
less important.</p>

<p>I have decided that my next milestone will be the end of May for
expanded alpha testing. By then I hope to have something that I can show
to a small, but slightly larger group of people. Anyone interested?</p>
