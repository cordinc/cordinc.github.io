<h4>Ruby on Rails Hosting</h4>

<p>Now that I have a couple of sites up and running on the web, I thought
I’d talk about how I chose my hosting providers and how it’s going. For
those who just want the short version: I use
<a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> and am very happy with them. Read
on for more details.</p>

<p>When looking at potential hosts for my Rails web apps I took into
consideration price, speed/memory, reliability and flexibility. I
basically wanted something cheap, reliable and fast. I’ve been an
amateur sysadmin before (and at my first dotcom job was technically a
pro sysadmin), so I wasn’t scared of getting into the unix command line.
Thus support wasn’t important. Similarly for a small project, bandwidth,
email accounts and credit-card billing systems would not be used. I
wanted more than a hobbyist’s hosting site (even if that is exactly what
I am), but not costly, professional hosting.</p>

<p>My first thoughts were my domain name register,
<a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, or the host of this blog,
<a href="http://www.pair.com/">pair</a>. I know a number of people have issues with
GoDaddy, but I’ve always found them fine for buying domain names and I
can just ignore their constant upselling. However, I wasn’t sure about
their Rails hosting and a search only found bad stories (eg.
<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/godaddy_hosting_now_supports_rails.php">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/blog/2007/07/rails-on-godaddy.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.mcmoyer.com/2007/9/14/running-rails-on-godaddy-a-k-a-how-do-you-keep-a-geek-entertained">here</a>).
I’ve also been happy with the service Pair have provided with this blog
and associated static website. I didn’t find much online about their
Rails hosting and decided it would in any case be best to use different
providers for this blog and my Rails apps.</p>

<p>Next I took a look at some webpages specifically listing Rails web
hosts, such as on the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/RailsWebHosts">Rails
wiki</a>. Among the
massive listing there, special mention is made of
<a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a> and
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">EngineYard</a> on a couple of occasions.
Certainly, these two companies seem to be held in very high esteem in
the Rails community and host many well known Rails sites. However, they
are both quite expensive - aiming for the high-end market. Too expensive
for my goals or really anyone without funding. They are more
aspirational - it would be nice to one day need the services of such a
hosting firm.</p>

<p>I also found a couple of lists at
<a href="http://www.rubyonrailswebhost.com/">rubyonrailswebhost</a> and <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2006/01/01/rails-hosting/">Zen and
the Art of
Programming</a>. They
rate <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> and
<a href="http://www.site5.com/">Site5</a> highly and both hosts matched my needs:
dirt cheap (under $10/month) and with decent reliability according to
reviews. Before signing up I sent Antonio Cangiano at <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com">Zen and the Art
of Programming</a> (a decent Rails blog I now
subscribe to) an email asking if he had any updated advice since his
blog on hosting was nearly 2 years old. Antonio suggested a new name,
<a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a>. Slicehost use a virtualisation
system so that it appears to the hosted application that it has a whole
server to itself (albeit a fairly small server). This means that someone
else’s app can’t hog resources slowing down your app. With memory
intensive Rails apps this is very useful. They also have full command
line access - you basically start with a clean build and can
install/configure it how you like. While any “point and click” users
would find it daunting, this really appealed to me. They provide a
number of <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/">useful getting started
articles</a>, including some Rails ones, so
I was sold. They are more expensive than other hosts at $20/month for a
256MB, but I have been very happy with their service over the last 6
months.</p>
