<h4>Golf Reviews</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>Back in May I decided it was time to learn to play golf. Since then I
have been to a golf school, 2 golf courses, a driving range and an
indoor video golf centre. I thought I would write briefly about them.</p>

<p><strong>The James Andrews School Of Golf</strong></p>

<p>I signed up for a 3 day residential training course with <a href="http://golfschool.co.uk/">The James
Andrews School Of Golf</a> as a holiday. I
greatly enjoyed the break. Although I can’t claim to be a good golfer at
the moment, I can say that I am a better golfer as a result of the
course as I saw my swing improve over the 3 days (considering I
consistently missed the ball entirely at the start). Indeed most of the
course focussed on the swing. The general format was swing practice,
putting/pitching practice, and then the swing again before lunch and
having the afternoon to ourselves. Nice course, good teacher, highly
recommended (although the food could have been better considering the
cost). I certainly left feeling prepared to tackle a proper course.</p>

<p><strong>World Of Golf</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately it took a while before I managed to get myself onto a
proper golf course, so in the interim I kept up my driving skills with a
couple of visits to <a href="http://www.worldofgolf-uk.co.uk/driving+ranges/sidcup">World Of
Golf</a>, a local
driving range. I never had to queue for a bay, itis £7 for 100 balls and
you can hire clubs, not much more to say. I still go regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Hobbs Cross Golf Course</strong></p>

<p>My first proper game of golf was at <a href="http://www.hobbscrossgolfcentre.com/">Hobbs
Cross</a>. in Essex. It seemed like a
friendly course, geared towards beginners. There was a 9-hole par-3 and
another more normal 9-hole. For the record I was 57-over for the full</p>
<ol>
  <li>There was a driving range, but the cafe was closed - take your own
food just in case. A good course and I’ll go back eventually (it’s a
good distance away from where I live).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Beckenham Place Park Golf Course</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.glendale-golf.com/course-7-beckenham-place.aspx">Beckenham Place
Park</a> is
probably the nearest course to my current abode. It is a cheap public
course (£50 for 2 and club hire), and is a bit harder than Hobbs Cross.
Aside from the golf, I was not greatly impressed: the hire clubs seemed
poor to me; the cafe was disappointing (salad in sandwiches is
apparently not often requested); there were many groups of kids
wandering around and the toilets were closed. On the golf side, quite a
few of the holes are uphill which causes me some problems. I’m in no
rush to return.</p>

<p><strong>City Golf</strong></p>

<p>I was given a voucher for a complimentary session at <a href="http://www.citygolfclubs.com/">City
Golf</a>, where you play golf inside,
hitting your balls towards a video screen. While this was ok for driving
practice, nothing else played as I would expect it. Putting was hopeless
and so was trying to get out of the rough - there was just no feel.
Although it was free to me, the costs seemed quite high. I doubt I am
their target market. I can’t imagine I’ll be going back anytime soon.</p>
