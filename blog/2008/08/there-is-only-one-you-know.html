<p>Last weekend I finally saw the Tour de France live. I’m a fan of cycling
and have been to the Track World Championships, but never to the Tour.
Generally I find road racing uninteresting live - you wait around for
ages and then they go past very quickly. I made an exception for the
Tour since it is the biggest road race and there could be a good
atmosphere.</p>

<p>We arrived at Issy, a suburb of Paris, around 1pm. The tour was
scheduled to pass between 3pm &amp; 3:30pm on their way to the
Champs-Élysées. The hope was that this would avoid the crowds. A fair
assumption since the roads were deserted apart from the police. Settling
at a road side bar with a few drinks we waited. After an hour the crowds
started to build and cars began to pass us more often. Then came the
Tour caravan - a collection of advertising vehicles resembling parade
floats. I don’t have any photos of this as the crowds were 3 deep
(larger than for the cyclists!) and were desperately scrambling for the
trinkets thrown from the passing cars. We largely stayed in our seats.</p>

<p>By around 2:45pm the caravan had passed and the peloton was scheduled to
arrive soon after. Only they didn’t. The schedule was based on an
average speed of 38km/h, but the riders were obviously going much slower
and arrived around 4:30pm. It was a pleasant afternoon. I’m glad I went
and especially glad I didn’t go to the crowded end of the stage. I’d
recommend seeing it once, but I don’t feel any need to go again. Road
cycling is definitely a TV sport.</p>

<p>Below is a video of the peloton passing us. The winner Sastre (in the
yellow jersey) is in about 5th place, but there is clearly not much
racing going on. The overall results had been largely decided by this
point.</p>
