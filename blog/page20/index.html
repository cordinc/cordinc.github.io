<p><a href="http://godisacube.com">God is a Cube</a> recently hit <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660056803">Steam
Greenlight</a>
and was quickly greenlit. The game deserves this success, there is
already an enjoyable alpha nicely showing off this promising programming
puzzler. The developer recently put out a call for Let’s Players, so I
decided to give it a go…</p>

    <p>Yes! This week is the culmination (but not termination) of the last four
years’ work. My game <a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">Concealed Intent</a>
has reached 1.0 status and been fully released. No longer is it marked
with the stigma of Early Access.</p>

<p>For the next week there is a 34% launch discount on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Steam</a>, and now for the
first time it is also available on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/concealed-intent">Humble
Store</a> too (same
discount).</p>

<p>Development work is not over, there will still at least be a version 1.1
update at some point. However, I think the largest part of game is now
complete. Reaching a standard I felt happy about and then saying that
people can pay for it without that Early Access caveat is a huge step.
Also, as well as the 1.1 update, there will be work on another game (as
stated in <a href="/blog/2016/01/goals-5.html">this year’s goals</a>).</p>

    <p>Stranger things have happened, but not often.</p>

<p>After eight and a half years, I have actually earned real money from
this blog. A few days ago Google paid me out just over £60 (the minimum)
for the ads that have been displayed here since the beginning. For
comparison, the hosting costs of this blog has been around £300 over the
same time period, so financially this is a bad deal.</p>

<p>Another way to look at this is that there have been 333 posts here, so
that is £0.18 per post - not a good salary, as most of them have taken a
couple of hours. There have been a total of 216,000 visits since
establishment, corresponding to £0.28
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression">CPM</a>, which is
actually not too bad. So the problem is (relatively) few people read my
posts.</p>

<p>As an update on my last <a href="/blog/2015/02/blog-stats.html">state of the
blog</a> post, this blog is down to around
1500 visits per month. Which is a base earning of about £0.05/month,
plus more from the occasional ad click. So the mathematically astute
among you may work out that based on the previous post and the earnings
rates I list above, it should still be many months before the £60
threshold was reached. Well done, you are right! However, I recently
started a YouTube channel (and associated blog): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">A Gamedev
Plays</a>. There
the CPM is closer to £0.70, plus clicks, and I’ve had a couple of
clicks. Clearly, this is where ad-based content publishing is heading.
The money from this is what pushed me over the edge.</p>

<p>On a suggestion, I recently dusted off an old copy of
<a href="http://www.prankster.com/winomega/">Omega</a> laying dormant on my hard
drive and started playing again. Never heard of this game? That is not
surprising. Omega was first released in 1987 and is a text-based
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">rogue-like</a>. One of the wave
of second-generation of rogue-likes (along with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">Nethack</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_(video_game)">Angband</a>) that
emerged in the 80’s, Omega never became quite as well known as its
brethren. It has some nice improvements over its peers, but also adds
some annoyances. Although most of its problems are endemic to
rogue-likes from that era.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/384480/">Six Sides of the World</a> is
a, sometimes unbelievable cheap, fun puzzle game. It is well made and
contains many challenging puzzles. Highly recommended and definitely
worth picking up if it is on sale or in a bundle.</p>
