<p>On a suggestion, I recently dusted off an old copy of
<a href="http://www.prankster.com/winomega/">Omega</a> laying dormant on my hard
drive and started playing again. Never heard of this game? That is not
surprising. Omega was first released in 1987 and is a text-based
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">rogue-like</a>. One of the wave
of second-generation of rogue-likes (along with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">Nethack</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_(video_game)">Angband</a>) that
emerged in the 80’s, Omega never became quite as well known as its
brethren. It has some nice improvements over its peers, but also adds
some annoyances. Although most of its problems are endemic to
rogue-likes from that era.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/384480/">Six Sides of the World</a> is
a, sometimes unbelievable cheap, fun puzzle game. It is well made and
contains many challenging puzzles. Highly recommended and definitely
worth picking up if it is on sale or in a bundle.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/463710">Puzzle Galaxies</a> is,
unsurprisingly, a simple puzzle game. It is moderately entertaining and
kept me playing for an hour, despite an unpolished feel. Considering the
very low cost (US$0.99, or even less when bundled) there is definitely
value for money. It is a decent, but unspectacular game.</p>

    <p><em>Update: this website is now shutdown. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube channel</a> still exists, but the old blog content moved here under the <a href="/blog/tag/A Gamedev Plays.html">A Gamedev Plays</a> tag.</em></p>

<p>I have set up a new website: <a href="http://www.agamedevplays.com/">A Gamedev
Plays…</a> will be dedicated to
discussion and reviews of all sorts of games (but mostly games that I
want to play). There is already an associated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a> and
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/agamedevplays">Steam group</a>. I will be
using the Jarrah Technology
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/JarrahTech">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook</a> pages for
promotional purposes at the moment.</p>

<p>I appear to be increasingly writing about games here. The desire to do
so will only increase. Unsurprising, considering that most of my time is
currently spent designing, building or just thinking about games. So I
thought it best to split out the games posts into their own website, as
such a monomanical focus was never the intention for this site. There
may still be games posts here, but only ones I feel are particularly
notable (similarly some of the old games posts from here may make it to
the new site).</p>

<p>The plan for the new site is to play more games and write about them,
both as a game design learning exercise and as motivation to create more
myself. As a secondary goal, I also hope to create a small community
around my games writing.</p>

<p>There is an explosion of game making at the moment. More and more games,
many with innovative ideas are being released. I need to be aware of
what is happening in game design. Since starting work on my own games I
can’t help but try to analyse what makes a game work (or not!) when I
play it. Being able to organise these thoughts into a coherent argument
in a presentable form can only help me improve my future games.</p>

<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153999/and-then-we-held-hands">…and then, we held
hands</a>
is a very interesting two-player only, cooperative board game, available
for free print &amp; play (P&amp;P) download or purchase. Despite having an
abstract design it is incredibly thematic.</p>

<p>Originally developed in just 48 hours as part of the 2014 Global Game
Jam, this board game went on to win best Golden Geek Print &amp; Play and
earn a proper published release. However, the rules of the GGJ state
that all games must be released under Creative Commons, so it will
always be available for free download, as long as you are willing to
create the components yourself. This review is for the free P&amp;P
version.</p>
