    <p>After Java developers became surplus to requirements at the <a href="/blog/2014/10/prs.html">MCPS-PRS
Alliance</a> I had to suddenly hunt around for work
again. The PRS people were very nice to me and had no problems with me
looking for new jobs while at work. With almost year of working in
London behind me, it was surprisingly easy to get interviews. Rather
than the months of waiting previously experienced, a number of positions
came through agents quite quickly. The best of these was at <a href="http://www.rbs.co.uk">Royal Bank
of Scotland</a> (RBS), in their corporate and retail
banking operations (very separate and distinct from their investment
banking operations).</p>

<p>So I began a 3 month contract as a Team Leader on the Service Charge
Review System (SCRS) just as it started. The project had a 12 month
timeline, so if things went well I expected to hang around for further
contracts. SCRS was driven by the corporate relationship managers. These
are the people who dealt with businesses, big and small. Unlike retail
customers (normal people going to bank branches), businesses and
corporations paid a raft of fees for the services they use (thus service
charges). While there are a set of “standard” fees that businesses pay
by default, in reality all the fees are negotiable. The bigger the
business, the more negotiable the fees they pay. There are a large
number of possible fees, from receiving a cheque, running a credit card
or having an overdraft. Perhaps a medium-sized consumer firm has a need
for large amount of cash-handling (cash passed to a branch has to be
secured, counted and transported), but rarely makes international
transfers. It might look for the cash fees to be lowered in return for
higher international fees. Part of a relationship managers’ job is to
work out if that is a change the bank is willing to make, and if so
arrange it. The relationship managers also create speculative fee
structures to tempt business to shift banks.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.one-man-games.com/artificial-defense">Artificial Defense</a> is
a fun stylish orbital shooter with some tower defense gameplay.
Developed by a solo-dev, the game shows a high level polish with tons of
nice little touches. It is a pretty and fun game that can keep players
entertained for hours (as I have).</p>

<p><a href="http://godisacube.com">God is a Cube</a> recently hit <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=660056803">Steam
Greenlight</a>
and was quickly greenlit. The game deserves this success, there is
already an enjoyable alpha nicely showing off this promising programming
puzzler. The developer recently put out a call for Let’s Players, so I
decided to give it a go…</p>

    <p>Yes! This week is the culmination (but not termination) of the last four
years’ work. My game <a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">Concealed Intent</a>
has reached 1.0 status and been fully released. No longer is it marked
with the stigma of Early Access.</p>

<p>For the next week there is a 34% launch discount on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Steam</a>, and now for the
first time it is also available on the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/concealed-intent">Humble
Store</a> too (same
discount).</p>

<p>Development work is not over, there will still at least be a version 1.1
update at some point. However, I think the largest part of game is now
complete. Reaching a standard I felt happy about and then saying that
people can pay for it without that Early Access caveat is a huge step.
Also, as well as the 1.1 update, there will be work on another game (as
stated in <a href="/blog/2016/01/goals-5.html">this year’s goals</a>).</p>

    <p>Stranger things have happened, but not often.</p>

<p>After eight and a half years, I have actually earned real money from
this blog. A few days ago Google paid me out just over £60 (the minimum)
for the ads that have been displayed here since the beginning. For
comparison, the hosting costs of this blog has been around £300 over the
same time period, so financially this is a bad deal.</p>

<p>Another way to look at this is that there have been 333 posts here, so
that is £0.18 per post - not a good salary, as most of them have taken a
couple of hours. There have been a total of 216,000 visits since
establishment, corresponding to £0.28
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_per_impression">CPM</a>, which is
actually not too bad. So the problem is (relatively) few people read my
posts.</p>

<p>As an update on my last <a href="/blog/2015/02/blog-stats.html">state of the
blog</a> post, this blog is down to around
1500 visits per month. Which is a base earning of about £0.05/month,
plus more from the occasional ad click. So the mathematically astute
among you may work out that based on the previous post and the earnings
rates I list above, it should still be many months before the £60
threshold was reached. Well done, you are right! However, I recently
started a YouTube channel (and associated blog): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">A Gamedev
Plays</a>. There
the CPM is closer to £0.70, plus clicks, and I’ve had a couple of
clicks. Clearly, this is where ad-based content publishing is heading.
The money from this is what pushed me over the edge.</p>
