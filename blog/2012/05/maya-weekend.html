<p>Available from
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/maya-weekend/id443941013">iTunes</a>
with the video podcasts also on
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pennmuseum/videos?query=maya">YouTube</a></p>

<p>In 2011 <a href="http://www.penn.museum/">Penn Museum</a> hosted a weekend academic
conference on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization">Maya
civilization</a>. This
series consists of recordings from that conference; each podcast is a
single presentation. The topics covered focus on Mayan women and
archaeological techniques (lots of discussion of research from doctoral
dissertations). There are eleven episodes all around 30-40 minutes in
length. Five are videos of presentations (so that the presenter and
their slides are visible), but the remainder are audio-only recordings.
Production quality is generally good, although the videos do
occasionally go out of focus. The talks are quite academic and dry. I
found it hard to follow sometimes, perhaps because I don’t have enough
background in Mayan history to hang the new facts upon. This series is
probably best for people who already have a knowledge of Mayan history.</p>

<p>The five video presentations all look at aspects of modern archaeology
technique. One looks at remote sensing - the process of using photos or
data from planes and satellites to identity large ancient sites (usually
because the vegetation growing over ruins is somehow different to
normal). Another presentation takes the complete opposite approach and
details pedestrian surveys. This is as it sounds - walking around and
recording what is seen, not as easy as it sounds in a jungle. This talk
provided some interesting details on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunchucmil">Chunchucmil</a>, a town much
larger than local agriculture could support so trading must have
occurred. One presentation looks at what can be discovered from skeletal
remains. This is not just looking at the wear and tear on the body, but
also analysing isotopes in the bones. In this manner the researcher
discovered about a quarter of people at one site emigrated from their
childhood areas. Another researcher analysed pollen samples found in
lake sediment to determine historical ecology. They found that the
highest levels of deforestation occurred soon after agriculture began.
It seems these first farmers didn’t know the limits of the land. At the
time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Maya_collapse">Mayan
collapse</a> forest
levels were fairly balanced, opposing some theories suggesting that
deforestation was the cause. Instead, evidence was found for drought
around this time, boosting an opposing theory. The last video
presentation promotes a new <a href="http://mayaarch3d.unm.edu/">repository of 3D measurements and models of
Mayan sites</a>.</p>

<p>Without the aid of visuals many of the audio-only podcasts are very dry
and hard to follow. Some becoming just recitations of events in Mayan
history. All but one of the audio presentation look at the position of
women in Mayan culture (the other concerned with inter-city interaction
and trade). Some notable facts include that at least three women rose to
become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajaw">Ajaws</a> (rulers of their city)
and that childbirth was considered equivalent of going to war.</p>
