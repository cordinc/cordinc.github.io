<p>I have now arrived and am (somewhat) settled in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur">Kuala
Lumpur</a>. Internet access has
been restored and our baggage has even arrived with no problems. Below
is the <a href="http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lwxvffGZeA1r95j6ko1_1280.png">Fort
Kickass</a>
we created out of all our worldly possessions. So far, so good. I am
setup and ready to start work again - although I writing this to delay
that start another hour or two.</p>

<p>My first impressions of Malaysia were heat and buildings. The city is a
near constant 30 degrees Celsius during the day and the nights are warm
too. Transitioning from a frosty London winter, the change was a shock,
but a pleasant one. I prefer the heat. I was worried about the humidity
in this jungle city (different to the desert city I grew up in).
However, it has been fine. There has yet to be the oppressive
combination of heat and humidity I remember during Perth summers when a
cyclone is passing through up north. Instead it is a constant background
heaviness in the air to which I’m becoming acclimatized. Perhaps the
regular rain storms help clear the air. Right now is the tail-end of
apparently one of the wettest KL rainy seasons for many years. It rains
nearly every day for a few hours (usually in the afternoon). The rain is
very heavy and would quickly drench anyone caught out in it. Although
having been caught in a few storms, it’s not that bad, it is never cold,
just wet (as if you jumped in a warm pool with your clothes on).</p>

<p>The rain also quickly overwhelms any drainage systems on the footpaths
forming large puddles. That is, if there are footpaths. KL is not a city
designed for walking. The city has grown from a small town in the jungle
into a modern city hand-in-hand with the car. Both the car and
omnipresent air-conditioning have greatly affected the city. The general
lifestyle appears to be one of driving between houses, offices and
shopping malls with only short walks if your destination is very nearby.
I haven’t seen much “al fresco” living.</p>

<p>KL is a growing city, and the direction of this growth is upwards. We
are staying in a low rise building near in the business part of town. It
is surrounded on two sides by high-rise towers (blocking the view of the
twin towers). The other two sides are taken by a 5-floor apartment block
and an Embassy compound (apparently built on an old tin mine thus
unsuitable for high rise development). The building has been sold to
developers and will become another tower. By which point we will have
moved into another tower. The new apartment will probably be very large
and nice by London standards, thanks mainly to it being very, very cheap
by London standards. Still more towers are being built. A 10 minute walk
to KLCC takes us directly past 3 construction sites, with several more
visible close by.</p>

<p>Apart from the humidity, my other concern about KL life was the
availability of pork in a Muslim country. I needn’t have worried. There
are religious police in Malaysia, and it is illegal in to serve alcohol
or non-halal food to a Muslim. However, KL itself seems to be more
relaxed than such laws would suggest, perhaps because of the wide mix of
ethnicities here. Access to non-halal food is possible, but not
unimpeded - you have to go looking for it. I’m sure an obviously Muslim
person would be refused pork and beer no matter what, but in the
cosmopolitan city with many Chinese, Indian and Caucasian people,
religion is not always clear. Chinese or Western places are a good
start. There is a Spanish restaurant called “El Cerdo” (the pig). At one
Chinese restaurant we were explicitly asked if non-halal food was
acceptable. At a Japanese supermarket the pork products are tucked away
in a corner with its own till and non-Muslim serving staff. Your
purchases are put in covered bags and not to be touched by staff outside
the special area - buying bacon is like buying porn. Alcohol is easier
to find. There are bars in the city (although not as common as London)
and most supermarkets have a small selection of alcoholic beverages.
Prices are around the same as London - so very expensive by local
standards.</p>

<p>Food here is cheap. Supermarkets in this part of town have a good
selection of both local and international food stuffs (especially
Australian). The local stuff is cheap. However, anything imported is
relatively expensive. Sometimes I think it would be cheaper to eat out
for every meal than buy and cook food at home (I must be going to the
wrong markets!). Within 5 minutes of where we are staying there are
easily a dozen restaurants and 4 food-courts. This density shows no sign
of dropping on walks further out. Everywhere we have eaten has been good
and everywhere is cheap. It would be hard to spend more than a few
pounds for a large delicious sit-down lunch at a food-court. Today while
waddling out of a new restaurant, I was surprised at how expensive my
lunch was - £3. The only caveat is you must like spicy food to eat
locally. Also, you must like sugar in your drinks. If you say “no sugar”
it is translated as “just a little sugar”, otherwise there will be a ton
of sugar in whatever drink you order.</p>
