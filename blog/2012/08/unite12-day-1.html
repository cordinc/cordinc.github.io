<p>Wednesday 22 August was the first day of the
<a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a> Unity conference in Amsterdam,
which I was lucky enough to attend. My first thought was Unity is larger
than I thought - the conference was packed. A couple of sessions saw
people sitting on the floor. The official attendance was 1200, over
double my expectation (although 200 of that number are Unity employees).
Also surprising, a nice lunch and breakfast was provided.</p>

<p>Day 1 notes from the sessions I attended are below.</p>

<p><strong>Keynote:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>After discussion of Unity’s popularity, the CEO showed off a large
number of published games created with the tool. This included a few
modern, well known and polished titles. <a href="http://endless-space.amplitude-studios.com/">Endless
Space</a> and <a href="http://universesandbox.com/">Universe
Sandbox</a> particularly surprised me as
Unity games.</li>
  <li>The demos of Unity4 looked particularly impressive. I don’t think a
small Unity developer like me need to worry about performance or
premature optimisation as the tool is obviously plenty fast enough.</li>
  <li>A new GUI system featured among some demos of future work (in alpha
now, probably not in Unity4, but the version after). This is quite
exciting for me. However, at 3-6 months before being available in
beta, I think it will come too late and I need to continue with
<a href="http://www.tasharen.com/?page_id=140">NGUI</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Molyneux">Peter Molyneux</a> talked
about his current work (using Unity). It is permanent, multiplayer
online game about eroding a cube to see what is inside - not really
my thing. What grabbed me about his talk is his motivations.
Molyneux said that the common theme in his work is the creation of
little worlds. Very similar to my ambition. He also said that games
should be “simple, delightful, surprising, engaging and unique”.
Sounds like good advice.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Performance Optimisation Tips and Tricks for Unity:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ah19swz4">structs</a> in
preference to classes were appropriate as structs go on the stack
and classes on the heap. Thus using structs results in less garbage
collection and associated pauses.</li>
  <li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern">Object pooling</a>
can also be useful for avoiding GC.</li>
  <li>Don’t put stuff in Update() that doesn’t need to be there.</li>
  <li>Instantiate/Destroy can be slow so try to avoid their excessive use.
Instead deactivate objects and keep them for reuse.</li>
  <li>Cache UnityEngine method calls like transform. This has often been
said, but here they explained why. GameObject.tranform is a .Net
property not a field, that does a number of matrix multiplications
and other calculations in order to derive the GameObject’s position
relative to its parents.</li>
  <li>Prefer primitive colliders over Mesh colliders.</li>
  <li>Time.fixedDeltaTime can be used to change the time granularity of
physics calculations. This is independent of non physics updates.</li>
  <li>Never move a collider without a rigidbody. This is a static collider
and every time such an object is moved a large number of
calculations are performed.</li>
  <li>Use texture atlases (multiple textures stored in a single image) if
bound by Draw() calls.</li>
  <li>Desktop machines should be able to handle a few thousand Draw()
calls (mobile devices an order of magnitude less).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Building Realtime Multiplayer Titles with Unity and Photon:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.exitgames.com/">Photon</a> provide a socket-based game
networking library similar to what I had planned. They also provide
a cloud service for the server-side of game engines, with a small
free option - worth a trial.</li>
  <li>Load balancing seems to be achieved via a login server passing off
connections to different game servers.</li>
  <li>They suggest ConcurrentUsers x 10 = DailyAvgUsers x 10 =
MonthlyAvgUsers &lt;&lt; downloads</li>
  <li>Hardware costs are likely to be quickly swamped by network traffic
costs in online games. So the lesson here is to minimise the size of
and number of network messages in your game.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Roadmap and Wish List:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>This seemed to be more about making suggestions to participants as
to what should be worked on and then getting feedback. Good to see
that Unity is listening to the community.</li>
  <li>An integrated debugger and editor (replacing MonoDevelop) seemed
popular (much clapping). A Linux editor suggestion garnered no
noise, so it probably won’t happen soon.</li>
  <li>Integrated version control (starting with Subversion) and
depreciation of the Asset Server got some applause. As did being
able to serialise Dictionaries. Both are things I could use.</li>
  <li>Supporting .Net 4 raised many hands, but it was unclear what benefit
such work would bring.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Aliens vs Predator: Tools and Techniques:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Postmortem on a game coming out in a few months. Chose this opposed
to GUI session as that is too far away from release to be useful for
me.</li>
  <li>Set up a condition/action system similar to something I have
created. The difference is their conditions are GameObjects and so
exist in the scene. This is handy for editing during gameplay, but
soon got so many they cluttered the hierarchy. They had to write
special tools just to manage them, but found no performance impact.</li>
</ul>
