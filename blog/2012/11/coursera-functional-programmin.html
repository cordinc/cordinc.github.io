<p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is an interesting language to a Java
programmer that wishes they were doing more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional
Programming</a>. As
such a person, when I saw <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> hosting a
course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming Principles In
Scala</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky">Martin
Odersky</a> (Scala’s creator),
I immediately signed up for both the site and course. Coursera is one of
the new online education websites. They partner with various
universities around the world and and run their courses over the web.
They have some impressive courses including an AI course by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">Peter
Norvig</a> and an Algorithms
course by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">Robert
Sedgewick</a>.</p>

<p>The Scala course was 7 weeks long and took between 3 &amp; 8 hours a week to
complete (the first week was 3 hours and the last 8 hours). Each week
consisted of an hour or two of lectures (broken into 10-20 minutes
chunks) and a machine graded assignment. There was no final exam. The
lectures were a good introduction to functional programming, but did
appear to assume some programming ability (fine by me). Scala is not a
pure functional language, but the course presented as pure a subset as
possible, using immutable data structures and only the occasionally
<code class="highlighter-rouge">println</code> as the only side-effect. It seems the language has either
greatly improved since I first used it in 2008/9 or I completely missed
the best bits back then. Now Martin covered all the stuff I remember
loving about Haskell back when I was university: lazy evaluation;
partial evaluation or currying; for/list comprehensions; and pattern
matching (although only for <code class="highlighter-rouge">case</code> classes in Scala). The language
definitely deserves another look, especially since the tooling with
Eclipse is definitely much better now. I imagine my old <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/combinatorial-iterators-in-jav.html">Scala
combinatorial iterator
test</a>
would be much better with lazy list comprehensions.</p>

<p>Completing weekly assignments was definitely a mixed blessing. The only
difference between this course and just finding Scala tutorials on the
web was the quality of the teaching and the assignments. The assignments
reinforced that week’s concepts. However, sometimes it was hard to find
time to do them, as they are due a week after being released. Generally
though they weren’t too hard, although the last one took me around 6
hours. The assignments were graded automatically, I imagine that is the
only way thousands of assignments could be marked in the required
timeframe. Unfortunately this meant that there was little feedback other
than a overall grade and an indication of where marks were lost. Marks
were gained for passing unit tests and some syntactic tests to ensure
good code style. This means it was possible to write a less than optimal
solution, but still get full marks and no feedback as how to do it
better. I’m certain that a couple of points my answers were clumsy
implementations - I felt there must be a better way, but got no
direction as to what that could be. In this way the course can only take
you to a certain level of expertise.</p>

<p>The assignments can also be submitted as many times as desired and each
submission is graded. This made it easy to keep going until achieving
100% (as I did in each assignment). It also made me lazy. Rather than
write proper tests, I just relied on the automatic grading system. If it
said I got the question right, who am I to argue? I think the course
coordinators may have noticed students doing this during the course as
the last assignment required us to write a couple of our own tests.</p>

<p>The lack of human interaction with lecturers or other teaching staff
could be a real problem and I think this the largest issue holding back
large-scale online education. I enjoyed the course and got good marks,
but it would have been easy for me to cheat (I didn’t). I can’t believe
that a significant percentage of students wouldn’t have cheated.
Cheating was rampant when I marked university assignments and every
single one was checked by hand (which the students knew). Now with just
machine checking, it must be easier to get away with it on such simple
assignments (where the number of possible solutions is relatively low).
Harder assignments would require prohibitive amounts of time to mark.</p>

<p>Most of the problems are for Coursera in increasing the legitimacy of
their courses. I just wanted to refresh my Functional Programming
knowledge and learn Scala. Thus, I am very happy with the course and
achieved my goals. Having just completed one course I would happily sign
up for another if it caught my eye (time allowing).</p>
