<h4>Old concerns in bandwidth</h4>

<p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep">A Fire Upon The
Deep</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Fraction">The Star
Fraction</a>. Both are
science-fiction novels written in the early-mid 1990’s by authors with a
computer science background, and both share (as part of the background
context) a somewhat antiquated concern with network bandwidth. A Fire
Upon The Deep is a rollicking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera">space
opera</a> - an exciting and fast
paced adventure containing many interesting ideas. The Star Fraction is
a near future tale of a possible singularity event (largely avoided) and
wasn’t nearly as enjoyable due to a dominant preoccupation with politics
that didn’t flow nicely with the action.</p>

<p>Both novels feature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet-like</a>
communication and both fret at points about having enough bandwidth. I
think Star Fraction even makes a reference to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a> at
one point. Younger readers might wonder what I’m talking about. In the
early 90’s the dominant forms of communication on the Internet were
email and Usenet. The Web had just been developed, but had not yet
gained popularity, and it was competing with the similar Gopher
technology. Usenet was a system of discussion groups like modern message
forums (e.g. Reddit), but much more primitive. At the time bandwidth was
severely limited and often a concern. For playing a text-only online
game in 1992, I was banned from a computer system for excessive
bandwidth usage amounting to a few hundred kilobytes over several hours!
Email has survived, but Usenet and Gopher have both been superseded by
the more flexible Web. Bandwidth has risen to the level where HD movies
(measured in gigabytes) can easily be watched online.</p>

<p>I can imagine both authors were blinded by their closeness to their
contemporary technology to see the revolutionary change about to occur.
Thus their books are now quaintly dated. It is interesting to compare
this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>. Written
a decade earlier than the other novels and dealing heavily with computer
networks, it hasn’t aged too badly with its portrayal of cyberspace (a
term first coined in the book), despite being written by someone with
little background in computing. In an interview the author states that
the Net as depicted in Neuromancer was a metaphor for the media, but it
still works. Evidence of the cliche that being too much of an expert can
cloud your powers of extrapolation.</p>
