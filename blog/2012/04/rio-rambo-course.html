<p>The most oft repeated tale of my time at Rio Tinto R&amp;TD is the Rambo
course. Every year a dozen or so staff would be sent on a management
training course. Many people were eager to avoid it. Although everyone
had to do it at least once and it was advisable to go if you wanted to
be promoted (so I was keen). Most people had been multiple times. Since
our team was so small, about a third of the facility went each year.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It took two consecutive days and we all stayed at a place in the hills
surrounding Perth. I wasn’t exactly a holiday resort, but comfortable
enough. We were split into two teams each with a cross section of staff
(in terms of experience). Each team contained one of the managers and
had one new hire (a role I fulfilled on my team). Our General Manager
was present as a observer and also worked with the facilitator (from
some consulting company that Rio apparently used a lot).</p>

<p>The format of the course was alternating sessions of lessons on
management with physical tasks. The physical tasks were set up so that
during the first session the least experienced member of each team would
lead it, and the last practical was led by the most experienced.</p>

<p>The course started with a task, thus I started as a team leader. The
idea was that the whole team would be blindfolded and led into the bush.
There we would be handed a rope and we had to form it into a square. As
team leader I was allowed to remove my blindfold if I wished, but then I
wouldn’t be allowed to move or touch the rope. I kept the blindfold on.
Everyone else had to stay blind regardless. It didn’t go very well -
neither team completed the task. My team’s square was more like a
rounded triangle. However, the other team’s square wasn’t much better,
although it was definitely more square-like.</p>

<p>Then we all gathered to analyse the team leader’s performance. I just
remember getting a bollocking. There were loads of problems. Mostly they
revolved around me not communicating enough, so my team wasn’t sure what
they were supposed to be doing. In traditional consultant fashion, the
facilitator ensured we finished with a positive. Apparently staying
blindfolded was a good thing to do in Australian groups as it helped
keep the leader as part of the group. Among other nationalities removing
the blindfold was preferred.</p>

<p>Then points were allocated to the teams. Neither team completed the task
so we both only got partial points. We were in competition with
eachother!</p>

<p>Then followed various sessions. The management sessions were basic
theory combined with information on Rio Tinto. We learnt about the
different business units in the company and how to get promoted (act as
if you were already at the promoted level). We were also told that there
were no more than 7 levels of management. True enough, I worked out that
my boss’s boss’s boss’s boss’s boss was the CEO.</p>

<p>The physical tasks were fun. The team leaders were keen to impress the
General Manager and organised everything. The rest of the team just ran
around in the bush trying to win the exercise. At the end of the day we
were fed well. Although we had to share bedrooms and my room-mate snored - I slept in the hall and wasn’t well rested.</p>

<p>Then started the infamous second day. The teams’ scores were close with
a single task left. Whichever team won it would win the whole event. The
aim was to build a raft to cross a small lake (about 15-20 metres
across), collect some widgets from the other side and then bring them
back. Points were awarded for each widget returned and there was one
widget worth of points separating the teams. The difficulty was
increased by the rule that people getting wet were “dead” so couldn’t
participate further in the task, and that only one widget could be
transported on the raft at a time.</p>

<p>I actually suggested that the teams collaborate to build a big raft and
bring back all the widgets together. That idea went down like a lead
balloon. Having been outed as a naive hippy pacifist, my team sidelined
me for the rest of their war planning. Our plan was to quickly build a
raft and tie a rope to it. One person would then paddle across the other
side and put a widget on the raft and stay on the other side while the
team pulled the raft back. This would then be repeated, but the second
person would come back with the raft on the return journey. The other
team had basically the same plan.</p>

<p>Our raft was completed first. Hastily built from barrels, some wooden
planks and rope - it didn’t look very stable. Sure enough, the first
team member who tried to row it got a couple of stokes before toppling
over. The raft was quickly pulled back, but the paddle was left floating
in the lake. With one team member “dead” another rower had to be found.
I swear all my team mates swivelled to look at me simultaneously. As I
didn’t have a paddle, I had to use my hands to move the raft (the
facilitator ruled that was ok). To improve stability I got myself as
close to the water as possible, basically laying down on the raft. I
then flapped my hands in the water from the wrists only (no arm
movement) to propel myself to the paddle. Even in this position the raft
felt very wobbly. One positive was the other team slowed down a bit as
they laughed at my “duckling” impression.</p>

<p>After was seemed like ages, I reached the paddle and then crossed to the
other side about the same time the other team launched their much more
stable raft. From that point on I was largely an observer of the action.
The other team soon followed us to the other side. We had a head start,
but they were gaining fast due to a better raft. After a few back and
forth journeys, the teams had an equal number of widgets. It was down to
the last one. I think we just had it (the other team lost one after it
got wet). As our raft started its return journey, both teams clustered
on the far shore. Our team to shepherd the widget to where it would be
scored. The other team to see if they could steal it.</p>

<p>As the raft arrived a scrum developed. Or at least that is how it
appeared from my side of the lake. There were a half dozen people
heatedly wrestling and a few more on the edges throwing buckets of water
(which were ignored). The rules were forgotten and the widget didn’t
survive (it was made of paper and soon crushed). Eventually it all
calmed down and embarrassment ensued. The task was declared a draw and
the other team won, although there wasn’t much celebration. A grand
melee over paper widgets is not a good look in front of the General
Manager.</p>

<p>When we got back to the office we all spent nearly a day filling in
health and safety reports. Many violation of the rules were detailed.
There were numerous bruises, a bad case of rope burn and a few dunkings
in the lake. It must have made for strange reading for those not present
(“so your work colleague tackled you to the ground, got you in an arm
lock and then stole a piece of paper from you”). Luckily, there was
video of the whole thing! There was much merriment from the
non-participating colleagues at an office showing. There wasn’t a Rambo
course held the next year.</p>
