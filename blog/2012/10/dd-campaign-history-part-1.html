<br/><br/>
<p>After <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/old-dd-campaign-maps.html">posting some
maps</a>
from my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a>
campaign, I got a little nostalgic for the game. Here is a history of
that campaign in many parts (it did run for 5 years). While I would
prefer to tell the stories “in character”, my memory of the first year
or so is a little fuzzy, so this first part of the history will be
largely a statement of actions (as remembered) without too much creative
embellishment.</p>

<p>I first started playing D&amp;D in 1985, when I got the famous 1983 red box
version of the old original 1st edition basic set. With a few friends we
played a few little adventures, but it never really got any traction. It
was only in late 1987 that a permanent game emerged. We just called it
the “campaign”, although during its 5 year existence we played more than
one game. There was a single D&amp;D game that thread through the years, but
there was a significant amount of the scandalously unknown
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2300_AD">2300AD</a>, plus brief sojourns with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020">Cyberpunk 2020</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing">MERP</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_007_(role-playing_game)">James
Bond RPG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Roleplay">Warhammer
FRPG</a>. However,
we started and finished with D&amp;D.</p>

<p>The first session was held in my bedroom after school on a Friday. A
bunch of eight 12-13 year old boys. We rolled up characters, with the
special rule that each character could have one automatic 18 (the
highest possible value) in an attribute of their choice and the rest
should be rolled normally. Still most characters had two 18s - we must
have been a very lucky bunch. One of the “lucky” ones was the magic-user
Bandance, that was my character. I am also certain there was another
magic-user, Greymarel, in the party. Kur-Tas Kai, a cleric of the war
god
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dragonlance_deities#Kiri-Jolith">Kiri-Jolith</a>
(we used the Krynn dieties) might have been present, but if not was
definitely around by the second adventure. I don’t remember the rest -
most of them didn’t last long.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/B2ModuleCover.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the first few adventures we would rotate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master">Dungeon Master
(DM)</a> position among the
group. Later I took on the role permanently. I don’t know who was the
first DM, but it definitely wasn’t me. The first adventure was the
classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands">Keep on the
Borderlands</a>.
Arriving at the Keep the party was soon approached by a shadowy figure
and hired to kill the Castellan. Being adventuring neophytes, the party
neglected to demand some money upfront. The Castellan, hearing that a
group of sturdy young men from out of town had arrived, invited them to
dinner. At the dinner he suggested he had a job for the party, but got
no further. Bandance attacked and quickly killed the Castellan. The rest
of the party was shocked but regardless included in the resulting melee
with the guards. They managed to escape by starting fires in the Keep
and running into the surrounding wilderness. There the party stayed a
few days exploring the local caves before attempting a return to the
Keep in order to collect their reward. However their passage was blocked
and no reward was forthcoming. Realising they had been ripped off and
tired of trudging around the dangerous borderlands, they decided to
return home. I’m not sure this adventure went as the DM planned.</p>

<p>Next a much smaller group of players did <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgissuearticle/139/the-beacon-at-enon-tor">The Beacon at Enon
Tor</a>
adventure. I don’t remember much about this other than it was short and
involved saving a mad wizard. Nor can I remember the next small
adventure we did, Jack of Knaves (which I can’t even find on Google).</p>

<p>Next a larger group got together and played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahasia">Rahasia</a>. At this stage the group
was Greymarel, Bandance and Kur-Tas Kai plus the dwarf Kleeton, the
fighter Hugle, the thief Aeflebad and the elf Celembor (this is in notes
taken at the time). The party was hired to save an elven princess from
an evil temple. Payment this time was whatever treasure we found on the
way. As we played it, there wasn’t a great deal of combat in this
adventure. For the first (and probably last) time the party even managed
to talk its way out of a fight. The most dangerous encounter was between
members of the party itself. After the princess was saved, a fight broke
out over how to split the treasure. Bandance was on the losing side. My
notes for this adventure state “saved princess, befriended intelligent
snake, almost got lynched by party over magic items and now holds
grudge”.</p>

<p>The straight up goblin-bashing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_on_the_Hill">The Horror on the
Hill</a> was next. This
was quickly followed by the equally badly named and similar orc-bashing
of Death Dungeon. Neither of these were particularly notable and both
mainly involved constant fighting with a little exploring thrown in. I’m
certain I DM’ed these two (especially since I wrote Death Dungeon and it
wouldn’t be fair that I play it too). At this point the party added
Talin (a ranger) and a little later Ugarit (a fighter and not the right
name, but neither I nor the person playing him can remember what he was
called), but lost a couple of the others. So the group was Greymarel,
Bandance, Kur-Tas Kai, Celembor, Ugarit and Talin. However, the person
playing Celembor left somewhere around here after having personal
differences with a few other players. I remember it centered on how to
have fun in roleplaying games. Celembor said he played in a way to have
fun without caring about the other players, while the rest of the party
said it was about having fun as a group. I think this counter-argument
was lead by the person playing Kur-Tas Kai, who was becoming de facto
party spokesman. Celembor was increasingly disruptive and ostracized by
the rest of the party until he left. At this stage we started playing a
hybrid of D&amp;D with AD&amp;D and some homebrew rules. The result was combat
was quicker (with critical hits and misses) and spell-casters more
powerful.</p>

<p>The last adventure of the campaign’s early stage was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dread">Isle of
Dread</a>. Again my memory
is hazy on this and I have no notes to fall back on. The party sailed
across the ocean and investigated a semi-tropical island, killing locals
until we got tired and sailed home. By the end the campaign had been
running over a year and all the characters were level 5. This was also
the last adventure not DM’ed by me. It was also the last standalone
adventure. After this the adventures merged into one another as a
continuous story, albeit one that was largely made-up as we went along.</p>
