<p>Almost exactly six months ago I wrote a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/08/modern-gaming.html">review of some modern computer
games</a>. All were
well known, and I said they were all excellent. I even suggested that
computer games were in a golden age - better than ever before. Now I
have completed 3 more well known, highly regarded, recent games. How did
they do in comparison? Not as well unfortunately.</p>

<p>First up I played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare">Call
Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, the original 2007 Modern Warfare game
which spawned the incredibly popular series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person
shooters</a> of the same
name. At first I was impressed with the intensity of this game. However,
the fast pace quickly slows with realisation there is essentially no
penalty to getting shot. Death is a mere slight pause. I felt like I was
on rails, being led through the action. The game was just a reaction
speed test. Multiplayer is probably better, but I didnâ€™t play that - I
doubt my reactions are fast enough. The story is ok, nothing special.
Although I did detect a possible subtle satire on war - but that could
just be me. The story is most notable for a couple of impressive famous
scenes (the nuke level and the gunship level) that do work very well.
This game is probably too linear and twitchy for me.</p>

<p>Next up I played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed:_Brotherhood">Assasins
Creed: Brotherhood</a>. I was particularly looking forward to this game
because of its open world setting in medieval Rome. Certainly the
graphics are beautiful and I enjoyed wandering around the ruins of Rome.
But the controls! This game was incredibly frustrating - it was hard to
get my avatar to perform as intended. I tried for many hours (28 total),
but still found myself often shouting at the computer and cursing the
clumsy controls. Eventually I just raced to finish the main story.
Incidently, the story is very silly and not worth discussing. This game
could have been so much better, but is just annoying.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago I completed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock">Bioshock</a>. This is an excellent
game, restoring my belief in modern gaming after the previous two
disappointments. The Ayn Rand-gone-wild underwater setting is
incredible. The art-deco and slightly cartoony (but I think that was the
point) graphics are decent. I often found myself just walking around
looking at the banners and architecture. Most importantly the controls
were super smooth. The game was also quite intense, particularly at the
start and end. Sometimes I jumped at a surprising action or went looking
for someone I could hear nearby. It is interesting that both this game
and Mass Effect 2, give the player some small choices that make minor
differences to gameplay, as opposed to the lack of agency in Modern
Warfare. A little choice (even if it is fairly inconsequential in plot
terms) goes a long way in making the player feel involved.</p>
