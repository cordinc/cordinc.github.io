<p>After joining Knowledge-based Systems at Rio Tinto R&amp;TD, my first task
was working on the MineSim project. This was a very successful
application to simulate minesites. To do this a user would define the
topology/geology of a mine, the equipment/personnel available and the
goals to pursue. The program would then simulate the mine minute by
minute. New blocks would be blown when ready, little loaders would muck
out the ore from the block and large trucks moved round the mine,
picking up ore and driving back to the dumps.</p>

<p>It was incredibly detailed. At the end of shifts workers would have to
be ferried around the mine, Muslim workers would take regular breaks for
prayers, people got sick and equipment broke down. Trucks would plot
their own route dynamically to take account of various events like mine
road rules, breakdowns and new areas becoming accessible or
inaccessible. It even simulated the engine dynamics of vehicles so their
speed and acceleration/braking profile were accurate. Very accurate as
it turned out. When checked against reality, our model was more accurate
than the manufacturers’. A certain US manufacturer slightly overstated
their trucks performance in marketing materials, while a Japanese
manufacturer slightly understated. When backtested against a couple of
real-life mines the whole simulation was accurate to within 3% of mine
output over a couple of months. Good enough for how it was being used
(testing the effect of various actions like buying more trucks or the
order of block development).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/omme_example.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>The application could run in a GUI if desired or alternatively just run
as fast as possible to the end. The picture above is the simulation
zoomed in on part of a mine (found in an old email). Adding a GUI was an
inspired decision. The mine would be shown as a graph with lines
representing roads. Trucks and other equipment were marked as little
squares - colour denoting type and size representing how much ore was
carried. Watching the squares moving around the screen at 10x normal
speed was hypnotic. It almost felt like a primitive game. It also gave
our customers confidence in the simulation when they saw it happening
right in front of them. It was also inspired to have the inputs and
outputs work through Microsoft Excel (rather than more technically
respectable formats) as the customers on mine sites were comfortable
with that tool and it made visualising data easy.</p>

<p>When I started on MineSim it had already been developed and used on a
couple of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-pit_mining">opencut mines</a>.
My job was to make it support underground mines and expand it so that
multi-year simulations could be run. The application at that time took
nearly a day to simulate half a year. This is probably the closest I’ve
come to proper algorithm work in my professional career. I improved the
graph traversal code (used by the trucks to find a path) by recognising
some properties of the graph and rewriting the existing suboptimal
implementation. There were some other gains to be made by modifying the
large amount of code written by mathematicians who taught themselves
programming.</p>

<p>Underground mines are run in a very dissimilar manner to open mines. The
processes and equipment are quite different. A well-capitalised
underground mine digs its main shaft first and then extracts ore from
the bottom up (it is cheaper than going top-down, but takes longer to
get started). This means that after “mucking out a stope” (meaning
extracting ore from a designated block of rock), it has to be filled in
again so trucks can drive on top of it when mucking out the level above.
This and other improvements to MineSim consumed my working life for my
first months at Rio Tinto.</p>

<p>The end of the project was supposed to coincide with a visit to the
underground gold mine sponsoring it. We would present them with the
application and train them in its use. It took flights on ever smaller
planes to reach
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobar,_New_South_Wales">Cobar</a>,
the nearest town in outback Australia. I was looking forward to seeing a
working mine. Unfortunately when we arrived it was shut down due to an
accident with the shaft lift the day before. No one was even in the mine
at the time of the incident (the lift was operating automatically during
shift change), but as a safety precaution everything was stopped for a
week while the cause was determined. It was impressive how serious
safety was taken.</p>

<p>It was probably a good thing there was no tour, it was a very busy trip.
Our first action was to give a presentation on the program. The mine
staff were impressed. They said most other people modelled filling in a
stope as negative digging, but we simulated the myriad of steps
involved. We were the most accurate simulation of underground mining
they had seen. Then they spent some time telling us what we had done was
still not good enough. It was an important lesson in the pitfalls of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model">Waterfall process</a>. We
should have been talking and confirming we were building the right thing
the entire time. I ended spending all day, every day trying to fix our
code. At the end they were happy enough to keep funding the work. They
got everything they wanted a couple of months late.</p>

<p>Part of travelling to a mine site was being given official Rio Tinto
clothes. At the office we just wore normal office clothes. At “site”, we
had to wear special clothes: steel-capped boots, hard wearing trousers
and shirts (with our names embroidered on them). I was given these
clothes a few days before leaving and when I arrived on site it was the
first time they were worn. I was immediately an object of ridicule. The
mine workers asked if my mother had dressed me. It seems that R&amp;TD
people had a reputation as soft city people and brand new, clean, site
clothes just played to the stereotype. My team leader didn’t shave that
first morning and his clothes were uncleaned - the mine workers accepted
him. The lesson was learnt. It was also quickly reinforced. In the
afternoon the Beard arrived after travelling separately to the team
leader and I. The Beard was an older mining engineer who had transferred
from the mines to work at R&amp;TD. At the office he was always well-spoken
and well-dressed, often with a natty waistcoat. When he arrived at the
mine it looked like he had been lost in the bush for a week and just
crawled out. As soon as he was spotted he turned the air blue with
swearing. I was amazed how differently he acted looked and compared to
the office. The mine workers loved it - they were all instant friends!
One person joked that R&amp;TD had finally sent a real man. I just went back
to my coding.</p>

<p>The MineSim manager was pretty cool and one of the best manager’s I’ve
had. When I needed to vent about some dodgy mathematician code (a 6 page
function, containing tens of nested if-statements), he let me and then
told me to go fix it. He managed to be friendly, but still get us
working (to his advantage there was never a huge pressure to get
something finished to a tight deadline). Senior management must have
liked him too, as he was one of the few saved from redundancy at the
end. He used to write two sets of travel reports: the official ones; and
the version just for the team, written in a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzo_journalism">gonzo</a> style - very
funny. When R&amp;TD was reoganised he managed to get our team renamed REPO
so he could use
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repo_Man_(film)">Repo Man</a>
movie quotes like “the life of a repo man is always intense” and
“ordinary fucking people, I hate ’em”. I can’t remember what REPO
actually stood for, it was a fairly tortured acronym if recall
correctly. His vision was that MineSim would evolve into an automated
mine system. I hear Rio Tinto is starting to move in this direction.
However I doubt any of our code survived. It would be surprising if
anyone currently working on mine automation was ever aware of our work.</p>

<p>Besides the underground work I did various other little jobs on the
MineSim project during my time at Rio Tinto. Including some work for a
diamond mine and a coal mine. There was also an aborted attempt to
produce a similar project for ore processing plants. It was to be OreSim
(pronounced “AWE-some”). It never went anywhere as it seemed we couldn’t
get anyone interested in it. That was the problem with R&amp;TD. We were
seen as internal consultants, but not very practical ones. Our work took
time to produce and was all this “computery stuff” done by people who
hadn’t spent much time at real minesites. When we did produce something
worth while we couldn’t sell it to other companies due to our internal
status. Thus we never got any scale. I believe MineSim could have been
sold on the wider market, we sometimes heard favourable comparisons
between us and commercial competition. A training product we produced
was actually requested by a competitor. It would have been a big sale,
easy, and not in any way a matter of competitive advantage (it was
safety training). So it was suggested to senior management, who refused
it. We had no real advantages as internal staff - we still had to market
and sell our services to mines. However, we were handicapped by not
being allowed to compete properly.</p>

<p>There were a few other projects I worked on: an optimisation tool for a
coal port in NSW; a website with searchable mine information; and, a
travellers advice website (unofficially nicknamed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Bogucki">Bogucki
Net</a> after a lost tourist).
My part of these wasn’t particular interesting. I did the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping">ORM</a> for the
port tool and the search and display for the websites. The port work was
most notable for difficulties with the first-timer team leader - he was
micromanaging, dismissive and insulting. It got to the point I had to
make a complaint to my manager (the only time in my working life). It
turned out the other team member had also complained about the team
leader too, so everyone calmed down and was on their best behaviour
until the end of the project.</p>
