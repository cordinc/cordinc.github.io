</ul>

<p>So after nearly 7 years on EGB technology teams I have moved on. Not out
of banking (at least not yet), but when the opportunity came to try a
different business area I jumped. This is despite being able to earn
more money if I stayed in my EGB niche. There are two related reasons
for leaving: the industry and technology are both changing to the
detriment of developers.</p>

<p>When I started in 2005, EGB trading was already on an upswing that
lasted through 2009. I’m not sure when this upwards trajectory began,
but the people around me considered it normal. Business was good
throughout the mortgage and banking crisis of 2008. When times are good
and the desks are making good money some of it is reinvested into
technology. There was a lot of optimism and this translated into banks
wanting the fastest and smartest trading platform. We got to rewrite
systems. Increasingly business was relying on technology - it was
becoming trade-by-wire. It seemed that there was much further to go.
Algorithmic trading is big in equities, why couldn’t it be big in fixed
income too. There was huge potential for writing interesting code.</p>

<p>This environment no longer exists. It was only when the European debt
crisis began to bite in 2011 that things trended downwards, but then
they went down fast. There is a great deal less ambition among the fixed
income desks. Most traders seem happy just to not be losing money -
something many are not achieving. Some banks are shutting down their
bonds desks. As a natural consequence there is less to spend on
technology and little desire to do more than maintenance. Flow volume is
king, and as far as technology development is concerned, that is not
hard. Thus less developers are required and the work is less
interesting.</p>

<p>Combined with this is the creeping commoditisation of bonds technology.
When I started ION provided mainly gateways, little tools and their
message bus. Over time they have climbed up the product stack. Now they
also sell pricing engines, autoquoters, autohedgers, risk engines,
position servers - nearly everything a bank needs to trade cash bonds.
The quality is fine too. Their applications won’t do everything a desk
requires, but it will do most of it and the desk’s technology team can
add the remainder quickly. Not all banks will use vendor systems (many
don’t like Ion or see advantage in bespoke systems), but enough will to
affect the market for EGB technologists.</p>

<p>Thus, once again, less developers are required and the work is less
interesting. I don’t see the situation changing until the market
improves - and I don’t see that happening soon. So I thought it time to
try a different business area.</p>
