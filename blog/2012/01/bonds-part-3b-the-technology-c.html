<p>Modern investment trading relies very heavily on technology. Computers
are now involved in nearly every corner of large banks’ trading
activities - a big change from more manual processes over 20 years ago.
It would certainly be impossible to run a EGB primary dealership without
significant technology expenditure. This post details an overview of the
technologies I saw on EGB desks.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I was hired as a <a href="http://java.com">Java</a> expert, so by my very nature I
mainly worked on Java programs. Still most code written right now (ie.
not in old legacy systems) in the banks where I worked was Java, and by
a wide margin. The main exceptions are financial math libraries which
are always written in C<span class="underline"></span> (by the quant
teams) and quick to develop, tactical desktop apps usually written in
Excel VBA. Traders are all very familiar with Excel and use it
extensively. On more than one occasion my job was to take a VBA app and
convert it to a faster, more reliable server based application. I heard
that C# was sometimes used for GUI applications, although they would
often communicate with Java server processes.</p>

<p>In Java work,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Standard_Edition">J2SE</a>
was used exclusively.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform,_Enterprise_Edition">J2EE</a>
has a very bad reputation as too slow and process heavy.
<a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring</a> is common.
<a href="http://www.junit.org/">JUnit</a> is used everywhere for unit testing. Same
with <a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/overview">Jira</a> for bug
tracking, but each place I’ve worked used a different build/deploy
system. Eclipse is the most common IDE, but IntelliJ has a few vocal
adherents - generally coders can use any IDE they want (as long as it’s
free).</p>

<p>Servers were always Linux machines. Developer and trader desktops used
Windows - as people are more familiar with those. Both desktops and
servers tended to be quite powerful machines, and replaced every couple
of years. A trader often had 2 or 3 PCs under their desk (if for no
other reason than to run their 6+ monitors). Server side processes were
split across multiple machines. One EGB desk had over 20 production
servers dedicated to their systems - the others were not far behind.
There was a constant push from infrastructure IT teams to use virtual
servers to save money, but that never happened with anything that
involved pricing or quoting. Speed was vital and we had the money.</p>

<p>The whole system was made up of many little programs - most doing a
single task. Any diagram describing the flow of data around the whole
system quickly became a mess, even without considering external systems.
There would be separate applications for position-keeping, risk,
tracking obligations, connecting to markets, negotiating RFQs,
straight-through-processing (STP - where a trade automatically goes
through to backend processing), often a few for pricing, and many more.
However a trader would normally view and control the internal EGB
systems through a single monolithic GUI. If more than one GUI was
required it would always generate complaints. Speed complaints around
trader GUIs were also very common - understandably because they did so
much.</p>

<p>Trading necessarily requires dealing with external systems, both outside
and inside the bank. We would need to pass on our data (via STP) to
other bank teams for clearing, settlement, accounting, compliance,
reporting. Similarly we would take in instrument static data
(information like a bonds payment structure, credit rating, maturity).
Externally we would connect to multiple markets for quoting, pricing and
trading. Inside the team communication was sometimes done over bespoke
socket or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_remote_method_invocation">Java
RMI</a>, but
more normally via <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIBCO_Rendezvous">Tibco
RV</a> or Ion Marketview
messaging systems. Inside the bank RV, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_WebSphere_MQ">IBM
MQ</a> or Tibco EMS were
both commonly used. RV is well-entrenched in banks and always had a team
dedicated to its support, although everyone seemed to be looking for
better.</p>

<p>Databases weren’t used extensively. Mainly for initialisation data and
historical data. Anything that was needed for pricing was cached in
memory or passed over low-latency messaging systems - a database is just
too slow. Their second-class status meant little effort was put into
their design. Sybase was quite common. Oracle and SqlServer were around
too. MySql was strangely absent.</p>

<p>Tick databases, in particular
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K_(programming_language)">KDB</a>,
were also used to varying extents. These are databases specially
designed to hold large amount of time-series data. We used them to store
every future price tick, every bond price tick and more. Gigabytes of
data per day. This data could them be used to analyse market events in
fine detail or back test new pricing algorithms. At one bank we
implemented a future pricing algorithm that people (including traders)
believed gave better prices. At the next bank I worked the same
algorithm was back tested with data from KDB and proved to offer no
benefit.</p>

<p>Each market had their own API. These were regularly updated. To get
around the constant work of writing their own gateways to the markets,
many banks bought market gateways from Ion. They specialise in
technology for fixed income banking and started with the market gateways
and a messaging bus to tie them together called Marketview (often
abbreviated to Mkv). They now produce a number of other applications to
do nearly everything in bonds technology - pricing, quoting, RFQ
negotiation, a GUI, position keeping and more. Every EGB team I worked
in used Ion products to some extent. But I would be surprised if anyone
outside for fixed income has heard of them - it is a bit of a niche
skill.</p>

<p>Ion were commonly hated by management. The company was adept at
extracting the most money from banks without them deciding to go it
alone. A few banks did try that (including one where I worked), but came
back to Ion when they realised the costs involved in writing bespoke
gateways. I found Mkv an acceptable product. They do messaging in a
strange non-standard manner, but it worked and that is what counts to
me.</p>

<p>Most EGB systems were bespoke and written by the EGB team. Utilities
like messaging and databases were purchased from vendors. It was
believed that having our own systems which exactly matched the traders
needs was a competitive advantage. Also, we were incredibly more
responsive to traders’ functionality requests. Ion applications and
Bloomberg were the main exceptions. All the traders have Bloomberg
terminals and used them extensively for market research. Bloomberg was
generally considered the authoritative source for financial information
or maths. On two occasions I produced applications that differed from
Bloomberg in their mathematical outputs. Both times I proved to
everyones satisfaction that my work was correct and both times I was
asked to change it to match Bloomberg because “that’s what everyone
uses”. On one of those occasions Bloomberg fixed their system a month
later so I had to change my application back to its original algorithm.
Bloomberg have a reputation for changing their system without prior
notice - the first time IT teams become aware of the change is when
their systems break.</p>

<p>The monitoring of production systems is omnipresent. Whenever a new
system is delivered, one of the first questions support will ask is “how
can we tell when it goes wrong?” Every bank I’ve worked at has a
different monitoring system. This always includes a system to scrape log
files checking for errors or other key terms and then flashing them up
on support’s screen. Server resources and network traffic are similarly
monitored. Java applications often have JMX interfaces or bespoke
administration tools.</p>

<p>Much of modern trading is controlled by computer. Certainly all the
routine parts are automated so traders can concentrate on more complex
issues. This includes updating prices and quotes for changes in the
yield curve on a millisecond scale. It also means trading on behalf of
the trader. For example, a EGB flow desk at a large bank will receive
(in the good times) thousands of RFQs on the D2C markets every day. A
trader would be overwhelmed trying to deal with all these, but in
reality over 90% are dealt with by an autonegotiation system and never
seen by a trader until it appears in their PnL. This program
automatically works out a price to quote based on rules based on various
parameters including the type of bond, our internal price, the quality
of the potential client (referred to as tiering), and the bank’s current
positions. A RFQ that falls outside the rules is passed to the trader
for a decision, but this is the exception.</p>
