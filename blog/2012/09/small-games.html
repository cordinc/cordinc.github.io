<p>Thanks to various Indie Bundles I now have scores of “small indie
games”. That is not meant to be disparaging (I aspire to create such
little games), just an assesment of their scope. Small teams have
necessarily smaller ambitions - at least they do if they want to finish!
Without further ado, here are my thoughts on 10 of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)">The
Binding of Isaac</a> is a great game and quite addictive. It is a sort
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a>. Each game lasts
around 30 minutes (although I’m yet to reach the last level) with the
player advancing room-by-room through a dungeon. The gameplay is
randomised with a reasonable number of monster types, but a huge array
of objects/upgrades. It is very easy to get started but very hard to
complete and luck plays a large role. Graphics and sound are good, plus
it has religious metaphors and poo jokes - definitely a winner. This is
staying on my desktop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.steel-storm.com/">Steel Storm</a> is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_'em_up">top-down arcade
shooter</a> that is not too hectic. It is not on rails so the player has
some choice and can play the game at their own pace. The gameplay is
quite good and I completed the single player campaign in 10 hours. The
only downside is that it gets a bit repetitive in the later levels and
the homing missiles seem to solve all problems (for all enemies just
back up behind cover and fire homing missiles). Still definitely fun and
worth the few dollars it costs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crayonphysics.com/">Crayon Physics Deluxe</a> a puzzler where
the player draws in crayon on the screen to create physics objects. For
instance, a swinging mallet can be drawn to hit a ball and propel it
across the screen. Nice idea, well implemented, but not for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cogsgame.com/">Cogs</a> is another puzzle game where the player
moves around tiles to form particular patterns. I like this and got
about a quarter of the way through in an hour, but it got much more
difficult towards the end. It is staying on my desktop as I can see
myself playing this occasionally.</p>

<p>I would consider <a href="http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/">Osmos</a> a
puzzler, but an unusual one. You play as a floating blob looking to
absorb other smaller blobs while avoiding larger blobs that can absorb
you. At first it seems hypnotic and relaxing, but soon becomes
frustrating in a good way. Staying on my desktop.</p>

<p><a href="http://universesandbox.com/">Universe Sandbox</a> is a gravity simulator.
You can model the solar system or stars falling into a black hole or
anything. It’s quite pretty and has a range of interesting preset
scenarios. However at larger timescales the simulation breaks down and
when setting up bespoke scenarios it’s hard put objects in the exact
right spot (if for instance putting planets at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point">Lagrange
points</a>). The developer
was at
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/unite12---day-3.html">Unite12</a> and
mentioned they are working on version 2 which will address these points.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.koshutin.com/">Hammerfight</a> is a 2D side-view fight game
where the players fly barrel-like contraptions and hit eachother with
hammers (hence the name). It held my interest for about 30 minutes
before the clunky controls and a screen so cluttered I couldn’t see the
action ruined it for me. The basic idea seemed to be just furiously
moving the mouse to swing the hammer. A nice idea, but perhaps a little
too slight.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finalformgames.com/jamestown/">Jamestown</a> is a classic
top-down shooter with 8 bit graphics. It is fast and furious like I
remember the old arcade games
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game)">1942</a> comes
to mind). This is not my sort of game, I prefer something slower.</p>

<p>My review of the last 3 games is the same.
<a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>, <a href="http://www.andyetitmoves.net/">And Yet It
Moves</a> and <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Super Meat
Boy</a> are all platformers. In these games the
source of difficulty is often not working out what needs to be done, but
actually performing the required actions with split-second accuracy.
Again, not my sort of game. Still, I can appreciate them: AYIM has an
interesting ripped paper art style; and, VVVVVV is a glorious 8 bit
throwback. However, they have all been removed from my desktop after
less than an hour each of play.</p>
