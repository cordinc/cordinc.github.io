    <p><em>Update: this website is now shutdown. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube channel</a> still exists, but the old blog content moved here under the <a href="/blog/tag/A Gamedev Plays.html">A Gamedev Plays</a> tag.</em></p>

<p>I have set up a new website: <a href="http://www.agamedevplays.com/">A Gamedev
Plays…</a> will be dedicated to
discussion and reviews of all sorts of games (but mostly games that I
want to play). There is already an associated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a> and
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/agamedevplays">Steam group</a>. I will be
using the Jarrah Technology
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/JarrahTech">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook</a> pages for
promotional purposes at the moment.</p>

<p>I appear to be increasingly writing about games here. The desire to do
so will only increase. Unsurprising, considering that most of my time is
currently spent designing, building or just thinking about games. So I
thought it best to split out the games posts into their own website, as
such a monomanical focus was never the intention for this site. There
may still be games posts here, but only ones I feel are particularly
notable (similarly some of the old games posts from here may make it to
the new site).</p>

<p>The plan for the new site is to play more games and write about them,
both as a game design learning exercise and as motivation to create more
myself. As a secondary goal, I also hope to create a small community
around my games writing.</p>

<p>There is an explosion of game making at the moment. More and more games,
many with innovative ideas are being released. I need to be aware of
what is happening in game design. Since starting work on my own games I
can’t help but try to analyse what makes a game work (or not!) when I
play it. Being able to organise these thoughts into a coherent argument
in a presentable form can only help me improve my future games.</p>

<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153999/and-then-we-held-hands">…and then, we held

is a very interesting two-player only, cooperative board game, available

abstract design it is incredibly thematic.</p>

<p>Originally developed in just 48 hours as part of the 2014 Global Game
Jam, this board game went on to win best Golden Geek Print &amp; Play and
earn a proper published release. However, the rules of the GGJ state
that all games must be released under Creative Commons, so it will
always be available for free download, as long as you are willing to
create the components yourself. This review is for the free P&amp;P
version.</p>

and has a roadmap that suggests it will only improve.</p>

    <p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Welcome to the brand new “A Gamedev Plays…” website. Here there
will be regular reviews of both cardboard and computer games from the
perspective of a game developer. The games chosen will be whatever
catches my eye or, more likely, is sitting in my Steam backlog! Where
possible there will be videos of gameplay to go along with the text here
and if the game impresses, reviews on Steam or BoardGameGeek, or
wherever appropriate.</p>

<p>I’m starting this site both as a learning exercise and as motivation. I
need to play more games. There is an explosion of game making at the
moment. More and more games, many with innovative ideas are being
released. I need to be aware of what is happening in game design. Since
starting work on my own games I can’t help but try to analyse what makes
a game work (or not!) when I play it. Being able to organise these
thoughts into a coherent argument in a presentable form can only help me
improve my future games.</p>

<p>There is a dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a> &amp;
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/agamedevplays">Steam group</a> for this
website. Also, my work <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JarrahTech">Twitter</a> and

  <div class="content">
    <p>I’m constantly on the lookout for good sci-fi TV shows. I grew up
regularly watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">Star Trek</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake%27s_7">Blake’s 7</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Dr
Who</a>. I love the imaginative
and/or expansive stories sci-fi allows, so I’m always willing to give a
new show a try.</p>

<p>Recently I started watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159076/">Dark
Matter</a>, a new show on the US Syfy
channel that has been garnering a few good reviews. I didn’t like it and
only watched 3 episodes before stopping. This is very unusual for me,
normally I will go through an entire season. However, in this case it
seemed very unlikely the show could recover - plus there is so much
other great TV to watch. The acting ranged from acceptable (most of the
leads) to poor (most of the guests), but the characters were cliched
(quiet Asian martial arts expert prefers swords to guns - tired) as was
the dialogue and plots. I found myself calling out what would be said
next - and was correct way too often. It also seemed to be produced at a
very small scale. The main spaceship was dark and empty, as were planets
and stations. In my opinion the show is not very good, or is it?</p>

<p>After considering it for a while, I decided that if this TV show aired
15 years ago during the Star Trek: Next Generation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Bablyon
5</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1">Stargate:
SG1</a> era, I would have
considered it as quite good. I certainly would have given it much longer
to prove itself. Both Babylon 5 &amp; Stargate had the same just acceptable
level of acting, plots and production at the start. Star Trek TNG was
actually bad for its first season. However, they all grew into great
shows. I have particularly fond memories of the episodes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_Command_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)">Chain of
Command</a>
from Star Trek and <a href="http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Severed_Dreams">Severed
Dreams</a> from Babylon 5.
Dark Matter would stand up well against the early seasons of those
shows. What has changed?</p>

<p>Well TV, including sci-fi TV has gotten much better, and shows have to
be good from the start now to even have a hope of success. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar
Galactica</a>
started with the incredibly good episode “33” (although I still pretend
the last season and a half never happened). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones">Game of
Thrones</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)">The
Expanse</a>
similarly started with well-polished episodes and a strong story. There
is no time to get writers up to speed and let actors grow into their
characters. Showmakers’ need to know where the story is going from the
start. Production quality has also greatly increased. Presumably with a
corresponding increase in cost, although perhaps not with current CGI
techniques.</p>

<p>All this is a long way of saying, I am still regularly amazed at the
quality of modern TV. The competition is so good a show like Dark Matter
feels very dated and behind the times. A show I might have loved not
long ago is now a fast reject.</p>
