  <div class="content">
    <p>I’m constantly on the lookout for good sci-fi TV shows. I grew up
regularly watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">Star Trek</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake%27s_7">Blake’s 7</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Dr
Who</a>. I love the imaginative
and/or expansive stories sci-fi allows, so I’m always willing to give a
new show a try.</p>

<p>Recently I started watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159076/">Dark
Matter</a>, a new show on the US Syfy
channel that has been garnering a few good reviews. I didn’t like it and
only watched 3 episodes before stopping. This is very unusual for me,
normally I will go through an entire season. However, in this case it
seemed very unlikely the show could recover - plus there is so much
other great TV to watch. The acting ranged from acceptable (most of the
leads) to poor (most of the guests), but the characters were cliched
(quiet Asian martial arts expert prefers swords to guns - tired) as was
the dialogue and plots. I found myself calling out what would be said
next - and was correct way too often. It also seemed to be produced at a
very small scale. The main spaceship was dark and empty, as were planets
and stations. In my opinion the show is not very good, or is it?</p>

<p>After considering it for a while, I decided that if this TV show aired
15 years ago during the Star Trek: Next Generation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Bablyon
5</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1">Stargate:
SG1</a> era, I would have
considered it as quite good. I certainly would have given it much longer
to prove itself. Both Babylon 5 &amp; Stargate had the same just acceptable
level of acting, plots and production at the start. Star Trek TNG was
actually bad for its first season. However, they all grew into great
shows. I have particularly fond memories of the episodes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_Command_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)">Chain of
Command</a>
from Star Trek and <a href="http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Severed_Dreams">Severed
Dreams</a> from Babylon 5.
Dark Matter would stand up well against the early seasons of those
shows. What has changed?</p>

<p>Well TV, including sci-fi TV has gotten much better, and shows have to
be good from the start now to even have a hope of success. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar
Galactica</a>
started with the incredibly good episode “33” (although I still pretend
the last season and a half never happened). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones">Game of
Thrones</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)">The
Expanse</a>
similarly started with well-polished episodes and a strong story. There
is no time to get writers up to speed and let actors grow into their
characters. Showmakers’ need to know where the story is going from the
start. Production quality has also greatly increased. Presumably with a
corresponding increase in cost, although perhaps not with current CGI
techniques.</p>

<p>All this is a long way of saying, I am still regularly amazed at the
quality of modern TV. The competition is so good a show like Dark Matter
feels very dated and behind the times. A show I might have loved not
long ago is now a fast reject.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Time for the <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">annual report</a> on the
performance of my peer-to-peer lending investment. <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/">Funding
Circle</a> is doing very well: they have
doubled the total amount loaned out; opened a US website; and, now can
be included as part of a tax-free ISA in the UK. Some of that extra
money loaned is mine. After last year’s good returns (much better than
other UK investments), I decided to add some extra money to my account.
So in retrospect, was that the right decision? Have the investors done
as well as the company?</p>

<p>Here are the returns for the last UK tax year:</p>

<p>Gross: 10.0%<br />
After Fees: 8.8%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 10.4%</p>

<p>Wow, my best year, and by a long way. 10.4% is an extremely respectable
return, especially in a year where the FTSE-100 share indexed has
declined. According to Funding Circle my lifetime (5 years) return is
currently 6.4%, also very good.</p>

<p>Gross returns have risen around 2%, with fees roughly matching the rise.
However, the biggest gain has been net bad debt/recoveries. In the last
year I have only had a single loan go bad - much better than previous
years. Recoveries have been huge! Larger than the loss and even larger
than the fees paid this year. Thus a total return higher than the gross
return! Kudos to Funding Circle team as they have now recovered about
half the bad debt from previous years.</p>

<p>So with that kind of return I should be adding more money to the
account, right? Unfortunately not. I manually choose all the loan offers
joined, as opposed to using the autobid tool. As my criteria has
tightened (small, guaranteed, short term loans to profitable, tax paying
companies with good credit rating and acceptable working capital), my
bad debt rate has dropped below the site average, despite making over a
hundred loans per year.</p>

<p>Since a rule change in the way Funding Circle works at the end of last
year (fixed returns rather than an auction), it has become increasingly
difficult to find loans to fund. This is not due to a lack of loans
available, or even a decrease in their quality. Instead it is because
the loans are filled in a matter of hours rather than days. Now most of
the best loans are already filled and closed before I even get a chance
to see them. Most frustrating.</p>

<p>As a result I have built up a surplus of non-invested money on Funding
Circle. Money that is not earning any interest (for me anyway). Enough
to fund several weeks worth of loans under the old system, but
currently, and for several months, there have not been enough
opportunities. My options are to relax my lending criteria, or start
using their autobid tool (effectively lowering my standards anyway).
Alternatively, I can accept my time on the site is over and start to
slowly empty my account (it will take a long time to close out some of
the loans, even with their secondary market). I have yet to decide what
to do.</p>

<p>Tune in next year to see what happens!</p>

    <p>Over the past two weeks we have driven up the east coast of Malaysia for
a holiday. From the south-eastern tip of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johor">Johor</a> (with a detour to see
Legoland) through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pahang">Pahang</a>,
including several days on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tioman_Island">Pulau
Tioman</a>. From there we
stayed some time in (probably our favourite)
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terengganu">Terengganu</a>. The finish in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelantan">Kelantan</a>, had us driving up a
broken and bumpy road to the river marking the Thai border. We drove
back through the centre of the peninsula and ubiquitous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_oil">Palm
plantations</a>.</p>

<p>My best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/eastcoast_16.html">available
here</a>. I tried to keep away from posting
too many of the endless empty beach photos inevitably accumulated from
such a journey.</p>

    <p>As an experiment, I recently recorded my first Let’s Play on YouTube.
The chosen game is the pre-alpha demo of
<a href="http://www.wartile.com">Wartile</a> - a tabletop inspired tactical combat
game with a Viking theme. The video’s concept is to look at the game
from the point-of-view of a another game developer and talk about the
design of the game as well as the gameplay. I might do more similar
videos in future.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ketg1llwpt0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The TL;DWatch version is that Wartile is is a fun playable demo and the
game is already very pretty. It is a good base on which to build a great
gaming experience with a bit of extra polish. For me, one issue is that
the core game mechanic feels a little confused. Some parts of the game
suggest a turn-based game, but it plays as a real-time game.</p>

    <p>After telling the below story to a couple of people, they thought it
should be shared more widely.</p>

<p>Scene: I call my UK business bank over an issue I’m having with a bank
transfer. After waiting on hold for several minutes, I reach a Customer
Service Representative and verify my identity. They ask why I’m calling.</p>

<p>Me: Hi, I can’t transfer money to an account at another bank.</p>

<p>Customer Service Rep (CSR): Sorry to hear that, let me check your
account… Hmmm, yes, there appears to be a block on your account. It
seems we had some returned mail so as a fraud precaution a transaction
and mail block was placed on your account in December. Someone tried to
call at the time, but was unable to contact you. I can remove the block.</p>

<p>Me: Hang on, December? I have received mail since then, I have a letter
from from you in my hand right now.</p>

<p>CSR: When is it dated?</p>

<p>Me: February, it is the February account statement.</p>

<p>CSR: Oh, that’s strange, let me check… Ah, yes. The fraud prevention
block is on the credit card card account. Your current account does not
have a block.</p>

<p>Me: So to because some mail was returned you stopped my credit card
mail, but my current account mail was still sent and all arrived fine.
That doesn’t seem right.</p>

<p>CSR: They are on different systems. The block only applies to one.</p>

<p>Me: So one system thought there was a fraud issue, while the other
thought it was all fine and kept sending mail?</p>

<p>CSR: Yes.</p>

<p>Me: Ok… I don’t really need the mail anyway, can you send less?</p>

<p>CSR: Yes, we can put you on our paperless plan, then you will only
received credit card statements and any current account statement that
includes a fee we have charged.</p>

<p>Me: But you charge me a fee every month.</p>

<p>CSR: Um, yes, that’s right.</p>

<p>Me: So you will send exactly the same amount of mail on the paperless
system as you do now.</p>

<p>CSR: Yes.</p>

<p>Me: Ok, don’t bother then, just please remove the block. My mail arrives
fine.</p>

<p>CSR: That is done, anything else I can help you with.</p>

<p>Me: No, bye.</p>

<p>I may have been a little abrupt there at the end. My apologies to the
customer service rep who was stuck in a bad situation. However, this is
just silliness from one of my banks and sadly not recently out of
character. I am becoming increasingly irritated by their strange
requirements, poor customer service, and outright refusal to do many
tasks other banks perform without issue. They also advertise themselves
as an international bank, but this appears to manifest itself largely in
their marketing copy. I certainly have trouble discerning much
international service. Four years ago I recommended this bank to another
person. This year I suggested another person completely avoid them. I
hope to soon take my own advice.</p>

<p>Also, I screen my calls, so that person may have called in December but
definitely did not leave a message - I check them all.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>
