<p>Want to be a government landlord in a totalitarian regime? Want to
steal, blackmail and spy on your tenants? Then you are in luck in the
dark indie game <a href="https://beholder-game.com/">Beholder</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioydoZi4Aj4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This game is really about evoking the atmosphere, and the stories, of
living in a depressing dictatorship. The player’s avatar is the landlord
of a government housing building. He job is to complete the tasks sent
regularly from his employers, family, and sometimes mysterious others.
To complete them you move around the side-on building and interact with
various items and talk to people. Sometime you have to complete
bureaucratic reports - make sure all the fields are correctly filled, or
you will have to do it again! The actual mechanics of the game become
quickly repetitive. Whether you enjoy it will depend greatly on whether
the stories and setting are interesting to you. The player is forced to
make decisions where no outcome is positive. Beholder is a decidedly
downbeat game - dark in both tone and graphics (it is often hard to see
what is happening). To me it is more interesting than entertaining.</p>

<p>Beholder is US$9.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/475550/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.
It has been bundled.</p>

<p>Be a God! Well, not much of a god. Be a minor deity of a pet floating
space mountain with very little you can do! That is a more accurate
description for <a href="http://mountain-game.com/">Mountain</a>. Or perhaps it
should just be called an ambient experience instead of a game?</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGqRMSzEZfs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>After a short bit of drawing (presumably to seed the random number
generator) the player can view their new mountain, and that is largely
the game. You don’t do much, mainly watch your mountain as it slow
rotates through space, suffering various impacts and storms. I like the
honesty on the controls option screen, “No Controls”. Not quite true,
players can control the camera and make musical notes by hitting certain
keys (supposedly certain tunes initiate events). Otherwise you just
watch. Luckily it is quite pretty, often with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner">Turneresque</a> lighting.
Perhaps it is a comment on “what is a game?” Or maybe just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock">pet
rock</a> project. Mildly
entertaining, for a little bit.</p>

<p>What is a more natural fit than a cross between Tetris and a dungeon
crawler? Err, everything probably. However, Dungetris shows the concept
can work… up to a point. This game is a good start, but lacks polish,
leaving the player badly exposed to the random number generator.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPPSw4qXwjM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Dungetris the player explores a castle in traditional rogue-like
style. The originality comes from how that castle is constructed. It is
built up from room blocks dropping down onto the current setup. These
randomly selected blocks can be repositioned (but not rotated) by the
player before dropping. Once dropped they become part of the structure.
Sometimes they block paths through to other rooms, or sometimes open up
previously blocked paths. Each new block may contain monsters or
treasure or other things and you can see these before deciding where to
place it. I love the ingenuity of this game mechanic, and it is the best
part of the game.</p>

<p>The problem is that the game is extremely random. The castle layout
rapidly becomes a mess, and the mission goals often require luck that
certain blocks or items drop. Early levels last about 5 minutes, but a
later mission keep going for over 40 minutes without a single one of the
required 15 specific monsters dropping - very annoying! A nice (and
surprising) idea, let down by huge over reliance on the random number
generator. In the end I just gave up after deciding it was more a game
of luck, than skill.</p>

<p>Dungetris is US$14.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/462200/">Steam
store</a> for PC only.</p>

<p><a href="http://hottinroofgame.com/">Hot Tin Roof</a> is a charming little
detective platform game, but lacks polish and feels unfinished. Do you
have what it takes to play?</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCc-9baU1mE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This is a gentle game about a detective investigating a crime with her
talking cat in a noir’ish setting. The story advances through dialogue
or shooting things, but not necessarily with bullets. Your gun is full
of possibilities depending on the type of bullet, for example shooting
bubbles that make visible previously hidden items. Mostly the game is
point &amp; click and choosing dialogue options, although there are also
some platforming sections. The game has a blockish block art style which
works acceptably, but feels unfinished. As does many other parts of the
game, despite being released months ago. Controls are problematic; save
points sporadic; and, it is never particularly hard. Still this is a
cute game.</p>

<p>Hot Tin Roof is US$14.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/253390/">Steam

<p>Why do all those tinpot dictators have weird notions and do strange
things. Perhaps you can do better in <a href="http://www.tropico5.com/">Tropico
5</a>, a city management game set on a tropical
island. The player is dictator of the all they survey, which considering
most gamers was going to happen anyway.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLTLapARdhT1h7MLsPTmkMeyksgXdLMG1b" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Tropico is a series of city management games set on tropical islands
(not sure exactly where, probability the Caribbean). In this fifth
edition (and the first I’ve played) you start during colonial times and
go beyond the present day as technology improves. Gameplay is fairly
standard for the genre: set policies and create buildings. It is a mix
of strategy and city organisation - you need to keep people happy, build
the economy, research science and (unusually for the genre) create a
tourist industry. The player is (probably) the island’s dictator, a nice
comment on the way players normally act in such games. The game plays to
the theme in a lighthearted manner. Attempts at humour start well, but
becomes repetitive.</p>

<p>The campaign is 16 missions, each building from the last. Although there
is a clever reset half-way through, so that all the player’s improved
game knowledge can be put to good use in building up again better from
the beginning. Graphics are good and you can zoom in very close. The
simulation models works fine, no obvious flaws, but then I found the
game very easy. I only failed one mission once in normal mode,
everything else I cruised through without serious impediment. It says
something about the game that I didn’t mind the lack of challenge, the
game was still very enjoyable and worthwhile.</p>

<p>Tropico 5 is US$24.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/245620/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.
It has been bundled.</p>
