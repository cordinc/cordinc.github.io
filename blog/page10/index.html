<p><a href="http://hottinroofgame.com/">Hot Tin Roof</a> is a charming little
detective platform game, but lacks polish and feels unfinished. Do you
have what it takes to play?</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCc-9baU1mE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This is a gentle game about a detective investigating a crime with her
talking cat in a noir’ish setting. The story advances through dialogue
or shooting things, but not necessarily with bullets. Your gun is full
of possibilities depending on the type of bullet, for example shooting
bubbles that make visible previously hidden items. Mostly the game is
point &amp; click and choosing dialogue options, although there are also
some platforming sections. The game has a blockish block art style which
works acceptably, but feels unfinished. As does many other parts of the
game, despite being released months ago. Controls are problematic; save
points sporadic; and, it is never particularly hard. Still this is a
cute game.</p>

<p>Hot Tin Roof is US$14.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/253390/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.
It has been bundled.</p>

<p>Why do all those tinpot dictators have weird notions and do strange
things. Perhaps you can do better in <a href="http://www.tropico5.com/">Tropico
5</a>, a city management game set on a tropical
island. The player is dictator of the all they survey, which considering
most gamers was going to happen anyway.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLTLapARdhT1h7MLsPTmkMeyksgXdLMG1b" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Tropico is a series of city management games set on tropical islands
(not sure exactly where, probability the Caribbean). In this fifth
edition (and the first I’ve played) you start during colonial times and
go beyond the present day as technology improves. Gameplay is fairly
standard for the genre: set policies and create buildings. It is a mix
of strategy and city organisation - you need to keep people happy, build
the economy, research science and (unusually for the genre) create a
tourist industry. The player is (probably) the island’s dictator, a nice
comment on the way players normally act in such games. The game plays to
the theme in a lighthearted manner. Attempts at humour start well, but
becomes repetitive.</p>

<p>The campaign is 16 missions, each building from the last. Although there
is a clever reset half-way through, so that all the player’s improved
game knowledge can be put to good use in building up again better from
the beginning. Graphics are good and you can zoom in very close. The
simulation models works fine, no obvious flaws, but then I found the
game very easy. I only failed one mission once in normal mode,
everything else I cruised through without serious impediment. It says
something about the game that I didn’t mind the lack of challenge, the
game was still very enjoyable and worthwhile.</p>

<p>Tropico 5 is US$24.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/245620/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.
It has been bundled.</p>

    <p>We are just back from a fortnight’s holiday in Japan, visiting
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto">Kyoto</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo">Tokyo</a>. It was definitely a
worthwhile vacation, and an interesting country, although Tokyo is
extremely large and crowded. Some thoughts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tokyo and Japanese culture did not seem that strange. Perhaps because
it has become globalised and so commonly seen. Tokyo just seemed like a
city big enough that normally small sub-cultures could grow enough to
become noticed and make a mark on the city.</li>
  <li>I love the idea of <a href="https://youtu.be/pcZSU40RBrg">underground automatic bicycle
parking</a></li>
  <li>There are ubiquitous (never vandalised) vending machines - so you can
always get a drink (sometimes even beer!)</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keirin">Keiren</a> races are well
attended, but rarely watched (the crowd spent most of the time
gambling).</li>
  <li>As an Australian/British person, having someone beckon you upstairs
for a restaurant feels so very wrong and likely to be a scam, but
apparently is nothing special in Japan</li>

<p>With the latest regular update its time to remind myself about <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/en/content/magic-duels">Magic
Duels</a>, the online
version of the tabletop game <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/">Magic the
Gathering</a>. Does the venerable game translate
well? Maybe not.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XyMjLWP3dgE" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>The tabletop card game Magic has existed for over 20 years and I have
played it for a decent amount of that time. Recently I started playing
the online computer version Magic Duels, but am less than impressed when
comparing it to other computer card games such as Hearthstone or
<a href="/blog/2016/10/duelyst.html">Duelyst</a>. It has all the standard parts of
Magic, well-designed and balanced card mechanics, collecting cards,
designing decks, duelling real opponents in what can be exciting and
close matches. However, instants slow down the game as the computer
pauses for possible interrupts (either too fast or too slow depending
your plans, or lack thereof) and mana problems are endemic so many games
are not competitive. Notably these parts of Magic have been skipped by
more recent computer card games to great effect. The game has a slight
pay-to-win issue, although mainly for new players trying to collect the
increasing backlog of cards. Older players can keep up through regular
play and quests to get everything without paying real money. Also there
are no draft games (my personal favourite) and opponents have a tendency
to quit early if the match goes against them. Overall, Magic Duels is an
acceptable translation of the tabletop game, but there are many better,
similar online CCG’s available now that have improved the basic formula - try them instead, unless you particularly want Magic (in which case
why read this review?).</p>

<p>Magic Duels is out free on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/316010/Magic_Duels/">Steam
store</a> for PC
only. It contains micro-transactions.</p>

<p>Want to go on a fantastical adventure, unleashing magical mayhem as you
go? Well-made and fun, but way too fast for me,
<a href="http://www.magickagame.com/">Magicka</a> has you more than covered.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LHyLusgWT9Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Magicka the player is a novice wizard out to save the world by
battling monsters. I can’t say much more about the story, because I find
this game insanely hard. After several hours of painfully slow progress,
I have given up. This is not because it is a bad game, just one that
requires fast and accurate keystrokes. Well into my middle-age, I do not
have the reflexes to play it well. The issue is that to cast a spell you
have to type a set of keys representing which of the 8 in-game elements
(water, fire, life, ice, etc) to include, plus a target, plus a optional
boost. There are various pickups in the game to add extra abilities (and
keystrokes) and special spells. There is tons of DLC and multiplayer
modes (including coop), but I didn’t try any of them. The gameplay is
basic monster fighting, largely on rails. However, the fights are quite
interesting and feel substantially different to each other. A big part
of successful fighting is working out the best spell combinations for
each fight/enemy. The story is also mildly humorous. A good game, but
too much button-mashing for me.</p>

<p>Magicka is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/42910/">Steam
store</a> for PC only at US$9.99.
It has been bundled.</p>
