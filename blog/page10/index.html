    <p>The shortest job I ever had was just 8 weeks - half of which was serving
out my notice period! It was my “summer job”, as it was just for June
and July 2005. Once my <a href="/blog/2016/09/rbs-2.html">RBS contract</a> ended, a
serious search for the next job began. There were a few bad interviews,
an awful experience with a pushy dishonest recruitment agent, and a
clearly best offer. Unfortunately it did not work out.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>So after four and a half years in Kuala Lumpur, we have returned to
London. My first impression? It is cold here. It has been quite a shock
to go from the tropics to a Northern European climate. Plus, it is
summer! Winter is coming, and I am not looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Other than that London seems vaguely the same. It is still incredibly
expensive. The media continues to be full of stories of either impending
disaster or glorious future success - depending on the proprietor’s
political leanings. When we left it was Austerity, now it is Brexit. The
trains are still broken on an alarmingly regular basis for what seem
like nonsense reasons. Companies say nice things and are polite in
public, but obviously couldn’t care less when time to get things done.
People are everywhere, everything seems crowded, everyone is super busy.</p>

<p>Forgotten when I left, but quickly remembered on return: terrorism
motivated attacks are common enough to be largely ignored by the local
populace. Seriously, I have never seen a Londoner concerned about the
London terrorist incidents that dominate the international news when
they occur. If you ever see a news item claiming that Londoners are
feeling scared, worried or “under siege” then they are talking nonsense.</p>

<p>There have been a few small changes too. Contactless payments are
ubiquitous. I tried to pay for my lunch with cash soon after arriving
and got a very dirty look from the cashier as they made an exaggerated
gesture to open the till. It is as if I was an old man counting out
pennies, which I suppose I was from a customer throughput point of view.
There is also a huge increase in the number of “gentleman’s barbers”.
Male grooming is definitely more overt. Hipsters abound!</p>

<p>Overall, I can not claim to be happy to be back. That is despite finding
a job very quickly in an interesting fintech AI startup. It has also
been good to catch up with old friends. I will probably be required by
work to stay in town over the coming months. However, I sincerely hope
this will be my last ever London winter.</p>

    <p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p>What happens after a drunken one night stand? Find out in the awkward
short story game <a href="http://www.gamesbykinmoku.com/one-night-stand.html">One Night
Stand</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MijKDEgn6kY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>You wake up, head throbbing, in a strange flat next to an unknown naked
woman. What do you do? What do you say? One Stand Stand is a point &amp;
click story game that starts with that premise. You can try to get to
know the woman better or sneak out or take a look around. Each game
lasts around 30 minutes and your decisions can lead to 12 different
endings. However it feels weird to replay the game as you already know
so much about this woman from previous run-throughs - it seems unfair
(just knowing her name is a spoiler). Still this short and tightly
focussed game delivers its story well and never gives the impression of
cheating or forcefully directing the player (probably because it is
short and focussed). One of the more successful story games I’ve played
and well worth a look if you enjoy this genre.</p>

<p>One Night Stand is US$2.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/549860">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.</p>

<p>Just one more game, just one more. Wait, where did that hour go?
<a href="http://www.pentadact.com/2017-03-03-morphblade-is-out/">Morphblade</a> is
an addictive well-made casual strategy game, where the actions you can
perform depend directly on where you are located.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c5iKZXVHkKs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Sometimes simple game mechanics rules can build to a deep tactical
gameplay. Morphblade is played on an expanding hex grid where the player
is battling waves of various types of bugs. The problem is that the
actions that the player can perform are completely defined by the type
of hex on which they are located. On a Hammer hex bugs can be smashed to
pieces, on a Health hex damage can be repaired, Acid hexes strip armour
from bugs, and so on. Each type of hex also has different rules for how
it can be upgraded. On a small playing area where you are forced to move
each turn, this game quickly requires planning several moves ahead in
order to progress. Bad luck is kept in check by the fixed order that
enemies appear, but memorising moves won’t work as the initial location
of the enemies and the hexes added to the grid are random. Morphblade is
very addictive. Games last 5-10 minutes of mostly thinking and the
player always knows what they did wrong, so the temptation is always to
try again. Morphblade is a great simple tactical game.</p>

<p>Morphblade is US$4.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/494720/">Steam
store</a> for PC only.</p>

<p>Unleash your inner misanthrope along with a deadly disease! In <a href="http://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/25-plague-inc-evolved">Plague
Inc: Evolved</a>
the player is a disease intent on the eradication of humanity. Very
grim, but strangely addictive and well-made.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cq68L3z3D90" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Plague Inc the player is one of various diseases, initially mostly
harmless, but with grand plans to destroy humanity. That is the game’s
goal: kill all humans. Leaving a single person alive is considered
mission failure. Progress towards success is achieved by gathering “DNA
points” (partially by clicking bubbles as they appear on the map), and
then spending them on various mutations - giving your disease improved
infectiousness, seriousness, lethality or other effects. That is it.
Simple, but effective and well-made. The graphics are good and there is
lots of easy to find information on what is happening.</p>

<p>Each game of Plague Inc becomes a battle between infecting as many
people as fast as possible, without killing them too quickly, and
finishing the job before humans find a cure. Games last 20-30 minutes
and every game I have played was close at the end. There are also many
new scenarios, diseases and power-ups that become available as you
complete earlier missions. With a feel half-way between a board-game and
a clicker game, Plague Inc: Evolved is clearly inspired by modern,
casual game design. It is easy to pick and play a quick game. I often
had that “one more try” feeling.</p>

<p>Plague Inc: Evolved is US$14.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/246620/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.
There is also a mobile version. It has been bundled.</p>
