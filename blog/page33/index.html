  <div class="content">
    <p>Radio became very important to me while doing <a href="/blog/2011/07/phd.html">postgraduate
research</a> in the mid-90’s. I didn’t have a TV,
so the radio became my main source of entertainment and news (the
Internet not being as all encompassing as now). The local university
radio station, <a href="http://rtrfm.com.au/">RTRFM</a>, was a favourite and I
would routinely listen to the excellent Strictly Rhythm show on Saturday
nights with Ben Stinga. He introduced me to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit_techno">Detroit
Techno</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_house">Chicago
House</a> and related styles.
It was the only place I knew to hear such music, and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> news groups were the only
place to find people discussing similar music.</p>

<p>One day there was a message on the newsgroup from someone else in Perth!
Even better was his invitation for anyone in Perth to a DJ set he was
performing. My only contact with other locals was that radio show - I
wasn’t even aware there was a local scene. So I sent the guy an email.
He wrote back, just as amazed as me there was someone else so nearby
online, and gave me the details.</p>

<p>He was performing at a party in the Swan Art Gallery on Hay Street. I
hadn’t heard of it before, but that wasn’t surprising. I knew Hay Street
though, one of the main thoroughfares in the city centre, it contained
many shops and what passed as boutiques in Perth. Based on my knowledge
of art galleries, Hay Street and his 10pm starting time, I quickly built
an impression of what to expect.</p>

<p>I imagined an opening exhibition at a hip gallery. Polished jarrah
floorboards, modern art. The cool crowd sipping champagne and cocktails
while saying things like “Yes, this is a slammin’
”Millsian“:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Mills beat.” I dressed
appropriately - dress shoes, nice trousers and collared shirt.</p>

<p>My first inkling of trouble began as I walked down Hay Street. I started
in the centre of town and just kept walking. I soon passed out of the
business district into the area between the city and West Perth. I had
never been there before. Nowhere in Perth is dangerous, but this part of
town was definitely rundown. I later discovered the whole area had been
marked for demolition and redevelopment. Thus it provided cheap space
for artist’s studios. The Swan Art Gallery was actually an old warehouse
used as an art collective by a bunch of struggling artists - part
studio, part <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squatting">squat</a>. At least
until it fell down, probably quite soon judging by the look of it.
Everyone was dressed in a grungy style. The event was the birthday party
of one of the artists.</p>

<p>I had come this far, so attempted to enter and was immediately stopped.
“Who are you? How do you know Beth?”. A couple of unfriendly people were
guarding the door. Perhaps they thought I was undercover police - at the
time they had a hilarious reputation for dressing inappropriately. I
said I didn’t know the birthday girl, but was invited by the DJ. They
checked and let me in. I clearly stood out and apart. The DJ was asked
how he knew me and he replied I was just some geek off the Internet. His
group of friends didn’t want to talk to me. When I tried to start a
conversation with his girlfriend, she walked away saying she had lost
her drugs and needed to find them (I later saw her crawling around on
the dirty floor, so maybe it was true).</p>

<p>I just found myself a nice spot with good acoustics and listened to the
music. The guy who invited me had passable DJ skills, but he played good
music - lots of old techno classics I had never heard before. He played
for just over an hour before the “proper DJ” took over with a happy
hardcore set. I left.</p>

<p>Not a very impressive entrance to the local scene. For some time, the
experience stopped me going to other events promoted by Ben Stinga on
his radio show. Eventually I did start going to some of his club nights
and discovered very little overlap between the art studio crowd and the
welcoming people meeting through the Strictly Rhythm radio show. But
that is a whole different set of memories (and one for later).</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>For my second course on <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a>, I took <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/australian-national-university/australian-national-university-anu-1347">ANU-ASTRO1x
Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the
Universe</a>
from <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">ANU</a>. A nine week introduction to modern
astronomy taught through the lens of 9 “mysteries”, or open problems in
astronomy research (as opposed to the more traditional syllabus of
<a href="/blog/2013/02/introduction-to-astronomy.html">Duke’s introductory
course</a>).</p>

<p>Each week consists of a set of video lectures totaling around an hour,
interspersed with multichoice mini-tests. These mini-tests are part of
the assessment, but are very easy and can be attempted as many times as
desired (guaranteeing a perfect score). There is also a weekly test
containing both multichoice and mathematical questions. While
mathmatical confidence is required, the maths used in both lectures and
tests is not particularly advanced, and never gets beyond the
high-school level. For comparison, it is easier than the <a href="/blog/2013/02/introduction-to-astronomy.html">Duke
course</a>. The course is
taught by <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/pfrancis/">Paul Francis</a> and Nobel
Prize winner (for work on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_Universe">accelerating
universe</a>)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schmidt">Brian Schmidt</a>. Both are
good speakers in a well-produced series, using a format of almost
conversational back-and-forth lectures with pictures and notes appearing
projected behind them.</p>

<p>The final exam is based upon a “mystery universe”. Each week a bit more
is revealed about an alternative universe with slightly different
physical properties compared to our own. Students can ask for specific
data (as if they were well connected astronomers in this other universe)
and it may be provided in the information presented the subsequent week.
This is a brilliant teaching idea, but I can only imagine the work that
must have been required to create it. There was lively discussion in the
forums each week on how the universe worked, even I had a quick go at
analysing some of the data. Apart from the interest and intrigue
generated by trying to solve a puzzle, the major benefit of this is that
the maths couldn’t be double-checked by researching currently known
information. In the Duke course, with it’s hard problems, I often found
myself on Wikipedia checking if my results were approximately realistic.
Here I had to rely on myself to check everything made sense.</p>

<p>The course starts with the expanding universe and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang">the big
bang</a>, before moving onto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy">dark
energy</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black
holes</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quasar">quasars</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst">gamma-ray
bursts</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark
matter</a>. None of which are
completely understood. The course ends with a look at solar system
formation and the prospect of life outside Earth. Both areas are very
active research areas as old theories buckle with new
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exoplanet">exoplanet</a> discoveries.</p>

<p>This is a very good introductory course in astronomy. I wish I did this
course before the Duke course. Furthermore, it is actually the the first
course in a series of four (the next on exoplanets is starting today).
So I’m looking forward to learning more.</p>

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography">Cryptography</a> is a very
important part of the modern world, especially for anyone active on the
Internet. For some time, I have wanted to do a course on the maths
behind modern cryptography. So I promptly signed up after discovering
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford’s</a> <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto">Cryptography
I</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>.</p>

<p>This 6 week course is the first half of a larger course comprising a
complete introduction to the subject (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/crypto2">Cryptography
II</a> runs separately). The
course consists of 12 well produced, information-packed lectures
presented at a rate of 2/week by the lecturer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Boneh">Dan
Boneh</a> as a series of slideshows
with annotations added as the narration progresses. The lectures run for
around an hour and a half each, so that is 3 hours/week just for the
lessons - if you only need to watch them once! There are also 2
assignments per week: a standard Coursera multiple choice quiz; and, an
optional programming assignment (although distinctions are only
available for those that do both). The course notes suggest 5-7 hours
are required per week to complete the course, but I never took less than
10 hours/week (normally just over that figure), although that includes
time on the programming assignments.</p>

<p>The course is heavily maths based. It starts with an introduction to
discrete probability, before going through various encryption systems.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher">Block ciphers</a> (like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard">AES</a>),
message integrity (using system like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CBC-MAC">CBC_MAC</a>), authenticated
encryption (eg.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">TLS</a>), basic key
exchange
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA</a>)
before an introduction to computational number theory and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public key
encryption</a>. All
the maths content required for understanding course is presented during
the course, but students still need to be very comfortable with maths as
it forms the basis of every lecture. I found this course hard, I had to
watch many lectures twice, and the assignments took me some time to get
right. Unlike other courses, it did not get easier as it progressed -
the difficulty level remained constant.</p>

<p>This is one for those with a theoretical interest in cryptography as the
practical side can be summed up as “use a modern industry standard
encryption system, never write your own!” A challenging, but interesting
course.</p>

    <p>So many games. Between bundles, sales and miscellaneous sources, I seem
to have accumulated quite a pile. A quick calculation suggests I have
only played 10% of the games I own. Some I have peversely avoided
playing due to the time they take to play, assuming they are any good.
Thus various well reviewed strategy games and rpgs sit unloved in my
library. Meanwhile, I have played a few shorter titles recently, and
here are some equally short reviews.</p>

<p>When <a href="/blog/2012/02/game-reviews-again.html">starting to play games
again</a>, at first I finished all
of them. Now I am a bit more selective. A game has about an hour to
impress me to play on. Most games don’t reach this level and are quickly
deleted. Then another filter occurs a few hours in. Often I just drift
away from a game when it becomes too hard or I lose interest. Then there
are the few games I play to completion. Take that into account when
reading the reviews.</p>

    <p>Apologies for the fake conflict in the title. There is no actual fight.
It is only that there is regularly talk of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada
Lovelace</a> as a female role
model for computer science, but very little mention of the more
influential <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/Lovelace_Hopper.png" alt="Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper" title="Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper" /></p>

<p>With very few women studying Computer Science and becoming programmers
(or other computer specific professions), there is some discussion as to
what can be done to remedy the situation. Part of this has been the
promotion of female computing role models, and Ada Lovelace has been
prominent suggestion. Ada was born during the early 19<sup>th</sup>
century into the British aristocracy - both actual (her father was a
baron and she became a countess) and cultural (her father was the poet
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gordon_Byron">Byron</a>). Studying
mathematics at a time when higher education was largely closed to women,
she encountered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles
Babbage</a> and his designs
for a mechanical general purpose computer - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical
Engine</a>.</p>

<p>The Analytical Engine was never built (unlike Babbage’s calculator-like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine</a>).
Still Ada Lovelace studied the designs and wrote some programs to run on
it (calculating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number">Bernoulli
numbers</a>). She also wrote
notes displaying some foresight on how such machines could be used as
more than mere calculators (like modern computers). For this Ada
Lovelace is sometimes referred to as the first computer programmer.
Although I think she is closer to the first computer scientist (as her
code never ran - a trait in common with many lecturers I have known!).
Ada cuts a romantic, tragic figure - never having the chance to see her
work realised and dying at the age of 36. She has also been adopted by
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">Steampunk</a> crowd. Ada
Lovelace has cultural cachet.</p>

<p>I am not trying to diminish her achievements - they are notable given
the time period. However, I do not think they are influential or
important to modern computing as more than a point historical interest.
I have the same opinion of the Analytical Engine itself - both were a
technological dead-end.</p>

<p>Grace Hopper was born at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century into a
middle-class family in New York. By the 30’s she had become a
mathematics Professor at Vassar College. During the war, Grace became
part of the US Navy’s code breaking team - the less lauded US version of
the UK’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchly Park</a>.
After the war she stayed in the Navy and joined the team working on
building the early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC</a>
computer. Then Grace wrote the first
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>. The compiler is an
important part of the computer engineer’s toolbox - converting more
understandable programming languages into the assembly/binary understood
by the computer. This is work for which I am personally grateful, as I
like to keep as far from the bare computer metal as possible when
programming. She also created the first machine independent language.
This became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> after some
design by committee changes (Grace Hopper was part of that committee,
but let’s not hold that against her). Nearly 55 years since it was first
developed there is still COBOL running in production environments (I
have seen it at some banks). Considering her work on the early COBOL
compilers, it is possible that some of Grace Hopper’s code is still
being used half a century after being written. That is impressive
considering most of <a href="/blog/2012/04/lost-code.html">my code barely lasts a few
years</a>. She retired from the Navy as a
Rear Admiral and had a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hopper_(DDG-70)">ship named
after her</a> (perhaps not as cool as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)">programming
language</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/first_bug.jpg" alt="The first computer bug" title="The first computer bug" /></p>

<p>Grace was clearly a person of great technical ability. Unfortunately she
is most remembered for an anecdote. While tracing an error in a program,
Grace discovered a moth had become stuck inside the computer resulting
in the error causing fault. Thus was coined the term “bug” for errors in
computer code and “debugging” for fixing these errors. I think this
popular story masks her influence. It is hard to remember a woman who
has had more impact on the practical side of the professional computer
engineer. Grace Hopper would make an admirable role model for any coder,
regardless of gender.</p>
