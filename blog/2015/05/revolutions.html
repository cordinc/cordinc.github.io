<p>Available from

and on its blog, <a href="http://www.revolutionspodcast.com">Revolutions
Podcast</a>.</p>

<p>Some time ago I finished the excellent and long-running history podcast
“The History of Rome” (detailed in blog posts
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/history-of-rome.html">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/06/history-of-rome-again.html">here</a>).
Now Mike Duncan is back with another extended podcast series, this time
on various revolutions. After 83 episodes, the series has covered the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War">English Revolution</a>,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">American
Revolution</a> and is
currently working through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution">French
Revolution</a>. Apparently
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution">Haitian
Revolution</a> will also
be detailed in future, but after that it is uncertain how much farther
it will go. As before, this series is well produced and Mike is an
excellent and interesting speaker. Each episode is around 25 minutes in
length (audio only) telling the history in chronological order.
Occasional supplemental episodes detail side stories or biographies not
directly related to the current episode, but germane to the revolution
as a whole.</p>

<p>So far I have listened to the 20 episodes on the English Revolution (not
counting the introduction on what defines a revolution). Knowing the
major events did not detract from the intriguing story. In 1642 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England">Charles
I</a> called a
parliament to raise taxes to suppress a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops%27_Wars">Scottish
rebellion</a> over his
attempts to enforce changes in religious dogma. At the time parliament
consisted solely of members of the English aristocracy and held legal
responsibility for creating and raising taxes. Safe to say the
parliamentary session did not go well. One of the Kings supporter’s
Stafford was executed after guilt by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder">Bill of
Attainder</a> (where
parliament declares you guilty without a trial, it still exists in the
UK, but hasn’t been used sine 1782!). It ended with the King attempting
and failing to arrest 5 parliamentarians. Then both sides (King and
parliament) started raising armies. Mike suggests the war’s length was
extended by infighting on each side and the inexperience of their
soldiers (at least until the rise of a professional parliamentary army).
Eventually the King was captured, and after some more fighting,
executed. Britain became a republic under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell">Oliver
Cromwell</a>, but differences
over what that meant continued until his death, with a much weaker
monarchy restored soon afterwards under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell">Charles
II</a>.</p>

<p>The very legalistic nature of the conflict greatly surprised me. The
action took place as much in parliament as it did on the battlefield.
Each side took pains to justify their actions under existing or newly
created laws, albeit sometime only by greatly stretching their meaning.
The conflict often involved forcibly removing the unsupportive or adding
supportive members to parliament so that a particular law could be
passed. Once the King was captured there also seems to have been great
effort involved by nearly all sides in trying to keep him the King, but
with great disagreement under what conditions. After a short second war
when Charles I attempted to take advantage of the disunity by having the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_English_Civil_War">Scottish invade</a>
(unfortunately for him, unsuccessfully). The army <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride%27s_Purge">purged
parliament</a> of all those
opposing it (essentialy a coup), allowing a successful treason trial
against the King.</p>

<p>The revolution is also notable in that certain radical views became
relatively commonplace for a while. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers">Levellers</a> believed in
religious tolerance, universal male suffrage (rather than just for the
wealthy) and legal equality for all. While their views were unthinkable
at the start of the war, by the end they nearly managed to write the
English Constitution (which was ultimately never written). I have a
feeling they will come up again in the podcasts on the American
Revolution. There were also the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggers">Diggers</a> a group who took the
Leveller manifesto and extended it to economic equality - becoming
something like Christian communists.</p>

<p>Very entertaining. This series is highly recommended.</p>
