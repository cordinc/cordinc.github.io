<p>Finally success! For quite some time I have been trying to find a
computer game that my girlfriend will like. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/06/too-many-game-reviews.html">To The
Moon</a>
and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2015/06/the-walking-dead.html">The Walking Dead Season
1</a> only held
her attention for a matter of minutes. She completed <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/01/game-reviews.html">Thomas Was
Alone</a>, but
claimed not to enjoy the experience. Easy to believe considering her
tense shoulders and sweating while playing. But now there is a game that
she both finished and displayed happy entertainment during the game. The
next day I was even asked if there was another episode or sequel to play
next! What was the title that reached such lofty heights? <a href="http://www.herstorygame.com">Her
Story</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/her_story.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Her Story is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_motion_video">Full Motion
Video</a> detective game.
The basic idea is that the player is investigating a 20 year old murder
by going back through seven police interview tapes. Each tape is cut up
into short clips (of a few seconds through to a maximum couple of
minutes) recording the response to a question that is never shown. The
brilliant idea of the game is that the player can not just hit play and
start watching the videos from the start, nor can they just jump to the
end. Instead they can only interact with the game through a search box.
Type in a word (or phrase) and if it appears in one of the clips then
that clip will returned. Maybe. Only the first 5 clips in chronological
order are viewable, although you can see the number of matches. So our
first search, on the name of the person murdered, returned 61 clips, but
we could only watch the first 5. To get the rest we had to refine our
search or come at them from a different keyword (and direction). This is
immensely clever, I wish I thought of it first! The user interface is
simple, and intuitive to anyone who has used Google Search before (which
is everyone, right?). At the same time there is still a challenge as
most of the juicy stuff is in the later interviews.</p>

<p>It hard to say much more about the game as it is easily spoiled. Be
assured that the story is good no matter what angle you eventually come
at it. We certainly paid a great deal of attention to the dialogue,
trying to glean every ounce of information. As we discovered more, we
had to reconsider what was said earlier, as many of the clips can be
interpreted in multiple ways (the benefit of not hearing the question).
There are a few twists and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">red
herrings</a> (I think). As time
progressed we methodically worked our way through the clips following
particular lines of investigation - until there it was, the solution!
For us it took just under 2 hours (including a little bit of time after
knowing what had happened to discover why it had happened). In the end
we saw around 60% of the available clips. Looking online suggests most
people take closer to 3 hours. I think we were a little lucky to finish
that quickly - we were investigating a particular situation and the
search term returned the final clip (as well as another with the info we
actually intended). That that is the only concern I have with the game.
It is possible that a player could see the crucial clips almost straight
away, if they hit upon the right search terms. However, that is probably
unlikely as the obvious search terms are included in many clips, so the
most illuminating clips are not viewable until more refined search terms
are known. I canâ€™t be sure, but I strongly suspect that the interview
text is minutely planned to avoid early spoiling - it certainly seemed
that way.</p>

<p>This is a clever game with a great story - definitely worth playing.</p>
