<h4>Quitting Eve Online</h4>

<p>I have stopped playing <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a>. I
started taking a look at this influential game several months ago and
kept playing during spare moments. I leave having spent very little in
real money (about £10 over 6 months), but having wasted far too much
precious time. So have my thoughts on the game changed since <a href="/blog/2014/08/eve-online.html?">the
initial impression</a> Not much.</p>

<p>I played just enough EVE each month to cover the subscription fees with
in-game money (buying PLEX for 30 days game time). Although my in-game
income increased with experience, the time available to play only
decreased (with work on Concealed Intent). It was becoming increasingly
hard to reach the PLEX target. In the last month PLEX prices dropped and
I took the extra saved to buy in-game items that increased my per-hour
earnings. I messed up and bought the wrong ones. At this point came the
question “why am I doing this?” Without a good answer I just stopped.</p>

<p>EVE is an uncompromising game. It aims to be completely faithful to the
idea of an open-world sandbox and largely succeeds at the cost of being
unrepentantly hostile towards new players. This manifests itself in many
ways. Players are “new” for a long time, months or sometimes years. This
is most obvious when looking at the skill system. My skills were
underdeveloped, especially compared to the large number of players with
many years experience. EVE has a stupidly long skill list. Since skill
improvement is through the passing of time, it entrenches the power of
older characters - older players are almost always more skilled. I find
that a little disheartening. At the same time it makes advancement very
easy - just wait. Part of the reason I kept playing so long was because
each day my character was a little bit better than than before. The
thought process is something like “if I keep the subscription going then
there will be so much more I can do - in just 3 months I could be
competitive in player-vs-player (PvP) combat!” This reminds me of my
time with <a href="/blog/2013/08/magic-the-gathering.html">Magic: The Gathering</a> - in that game there is a compulsion to collect the cards. In EVE a
player collects skill points (and passively too!).</p>

<p>One of the reasons EVE has so many skills is because there are many
activities or roles to perform: mining, trading, manufacturing,
research, scanning, planetary interaction, hauling, missions, factional
warfare, and more. Each has its own set of skills. Sometimes EVE feels
like many games tacked onto eachother. These different activities seem
to exist to give non-PvP’ers something to do and a way of generating
in-game money. I can do the same thing for a a while (a month or so),
but after that it can feel like a grind, and that is definitely how EVE
began to feel. All the different activities are supposed to make a
player feel like there is a galaxy of possibilities, but the activities
themselves are just constant repetition of the same thing. I think most
players just grind it for the in-game money (ISK).</p>

<p>ISK is really the scoring system of EVE. In other MMO’s the score is
your level, but here that is just a function of time. Instead how much
money a player has determines what ships they can fly and can even be
used to pay for the game itself. One of the things EVE has gotten right
is how the in-game money flows around the game. PvP’ing is the end game
for experienced players: the non-grindy and high status part of the
game. It is also a money sink. PvP requires ISK to replace the
inevitable ship losses. There is a saying in EVE that ships are just
ammunition; don’t worry about losing them and don’t fly what you can’t
afford to replace (they will be replaced often!). So the top players
have to spend the most (either individually or as a group - a
corporation in EVE). ISK flows into the game from loot and mining. ISK
leaves the game from ship losses and PLEX usage. In most games the top
players earn the most (from loot) and there isn’t a suitable way for
in-game wealth to leave in the same volume it is created. Thus the whole
system breaks down. Typically there ends up being too many high quality
items that end up being very cheap. New players buy them and become
hugely overpowered relative to experience. EVE gets round this by
regularly blowing up the high quality items.</p>

<p>I think this economic cycle is the secret to EVE’s long-term success. It
means that new players take time to build up their wealth, but there are
many activities that help them do this. Older players are constantly in
need of new ships and this drives other activities to manufacture them.
Which in turn creates content for other players. Many of the big battles
heard about in the media have their origins in acquiring control of
resources. The whole system is stable enough for real money to be
injected into the system in the form of selling PLEX. There are a few
problems here and there in the system: inflation, alts and multiboxing
are all prevalent. However, in general the system half works, which is
still infinitely better than any other MMO I know about.</p>

<p>It is just that the process of building wealth and experience is just
not much fun to me. I also didn’t think the endgame of PvP was for me
either - lag and crashes plagued my game experience. Other aspects of
the game made it hard for me to enjoy. There was very often offensive
and racist comments in the game chat. Some players took great joy in
attacking other players unexpectently when doing non-combat activities.
I was a member of a corporation dedicated to teaching new players. Other
people would declare war on this corp just to get easy kills on newbies.
So as a result, it was very dangerous for me to even fly around from
star to star doing in-game missions (against the computer, not other
players). On two occasions I was attacked while doing non-PvP
activities. There is no safe place to learn in EVE, and many people
willing to “grief” you in order to “harvest your tears”. In fact there
are multiple in-game organisations dedicated to attacking non-PvP
players. It doesn’t give one much faith in humanity.</p>

<p>Of course some players enjoy this type of gameplay. Although I think
there is a very small market for games like EVE, it is a hardcore
audience - otherwise the game wouldn’t have existed so long. EVE is
probably the most detailed and in-depth game I’ve played. It is also the
most unforgiving. In the end the reason to stop playing is that the game
just endlessly repeats itself, and I don’t need a second job grinding
online.</p>
