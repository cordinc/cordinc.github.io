<p>A year gone by and it is time again for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game
Jam</a> here in Kuala Lumpur. At thousands of
locations around the world, people got together in small teams to create
a game from scratch in 48 hours. In Malaysia 15 teams totaling around 70
people took part. This included me.</p>

<p>Together with four teammates, we created EAT! (the source and windows
executable can be <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/eat">downloaded
here</a>). A game about deciding
where to eat when everyone wants something different. It is quite
simple. The 4 friends walk down the street and the player presses space
to enter a restaurant as they pass. The happier the friends are with the
food available, the more points and more time you have to play.</p>

<p>I’ve never been to a Game Jam in another country, but I think things run
a little different in Malaysia. For a start, jammers here actually have
closer to 36 hours to create their game rather than the headline 48
hours. For instance, so that people could come after work, the jam
actually started close to 7pm local time (rather than the normal
advertised 5pm).</p>

<p>Once the theme was announced we all went to dinner in small groups. I
only knew one of the people in the group I ate with. Thus conversation
started slowly, but soon we were all bouncing ideas of each other on the
theme “What do we do now?” I particularly liked the idea someone
suggested of starting the game with “Press Space to defeat the Final
Boss!” and then the player having to deal with life after where a game
normally ends. My idea was based on the earlier discussion of where we
should eat dinner. It was suggested this could be very Malaysian, as
going out for good and diverse food is a strong aspect of Malaysian
culture (at least I think so). It was also the result of purposefully
trying to think of a very simple idea considering the <a href="/blog/2014/01/global-game-jam-2014.html">stress of last
year’s overly ambitious game jam
project</a>.</p>

<p>After dinner everyone reconvened in the <a href="http://www.kdu.edu.my">KDU</a>
library (a large space easily big and comfortable enough for everyone).
Here the jammers split up. Most of the jammers were current or recently
graduated KDU gamedev students and they all knew each other. So despite
a request not to preform teams, over 2/3 of the the jammers were in one
of the 10 preformed teams of (presumably) university friends. However,
to make things a little more difficult for these people, they had a
special extra rule applied to them. Their game had to follow the theme,
but also had to have a randomly generated name. So each of these teams
came to the front in turn and used <a href="http://videogamena.me">The Video Game Name
Generator</a> (try it!) while the rest of us
marveled at how “Sleazy Burger Overload” or “Bigtime Crowbar Babies”
could possibly be made into a game!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj15/pitching.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj15/pitching.jpg" title="Pitching the ideas" width="550" alt="Pitching the ideas" /></a></p>

<p>Now the 20 or so individual jammers (like me) had to decide their game
projects. After some time to refine our ideas, we each had 5 minutes to
pitch them to the rest of the group, followed by time for discussion.
Then it was time to vote on the ideas. As usual the group was programmer
limited. so it was decided there would be 4 ideas made and we each
placed little stickers on our top three ideas. There were some excellent
ideas on the theme, and some good ambitious ideas. I voted for simple
ideas that could be expanded if time allowed (an anti Shark Fin Soup
game; a Telltale-like moral choices game; and, my own idea), based on my
top 3 lessons from my first Game Jam last year:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Bring earplugs/headphones</li>
  <li>Bring a towel - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSsR419HBpQ">you always need to know where your towel
is!</a></li>
  <li>Don’t try to do too much - start small and build up</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj15/voting.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj15/voting.jpg" title="Voting on the ideas" width="550" alt="Voting on the ideas" /></a></p>

<p>Last year my idea got 0 votes. This year’s idea accumulated 11 and was
one of the four chosen to be made (it is the one in the centre of the
photo above). Actually, all the ideas I voted for came out on top and
were made, but since it was originally my idea, I thought I should join
the EAT team. Another programmer, two artists and a game designer also
joined the team. Below is how we looked on Sunday just before submitting
the game. Finally we got to start work around 2am. The idea was quickly
fleshed out and a task list written. The artists began sketching 2D
sprites for the friends and buildings, while the game designer worked
out a matrix of food desires vs restaurant satisfaction levels. The
other programmer and I started work on the skeleton of the code.
However, I was already feeling the late hour and making silly mistakes.
Luckily, Daniel, the other coder was more awake (“I’m normally up
playing DOTA at this time of night”) and completed the basic project
structure while I had a nap. After that we sometimes pair programmed and
sometimes worked individually while the other was busy with something
else. The task list was swiftly diminished.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj15/team.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj15/team.jpg" title="The EAT team" width="550" alt="The EAT team" /></a></p>

<p>By Saturday night our original plan for the game was largely complete
apart from some final 2D art. We had time to take a look around at the
other ideas and chat. Like last year, the jammers as a whole were a
friendly bunch. Everyone, including the preformed teams, was happy to
talk about their games, how they had achieved various effects and the
pros/cons of what they were doing. All you had to do was walk up to them
and ask how they were going. I find this camaraderie one of the
highlights of the GGJ process. Everyone is present because they like
making games.</p>

<p>With the final artwork in place we still had a few hours left. So we
play-tested and brainstormed about ways to make our game better. One of
the main issues was the randomness of the game - often ending with
players scoring negative points. This could especially happen if the
player was unlucky enough to have one of the in-game friends desiring
desert, as such people would always be unhappy with any another option.
“People wanting desert are such a pain!” We soon came up with a page of
ideas and added the buffet (a wildcard) and restaurants that served two
types of food. The game became much more playable as a result.</p>

<p>Then it was time for pizza and a group photo. After the pizza the teams
submitted their projects and demonstrated them for all the participants
and some others who came to see what we had done. No prizes or awards,
just the games themselves and the people who created them - it felt
right to me that way.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj15/pizza.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj15/pizza.jpg" title="Pizza party" width="500" alt="Pizza party" /></a></p>

<p>I had a great time at this year’s jam and am immensely proud of the game
we created. It may be small, but that just meant we had time to play
with other ideas and build upon it (and we finished it!). I can highly
recommend attending if possible - even if you don’t know anyone else
going. In fact, especially if you don’t know any other local gamedevs.</p>

<p>Thanks to all the other participants and organisers - well done to
everyone. You helped make an enjoyable 48 hours.</p>
