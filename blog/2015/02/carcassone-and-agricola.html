<p>My partner and I enjoy the occasional modern board game. There has been
a renaissance in high quality board games in recent years. If you
haven’t tried any of the new
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game">European-style</a> I
can recommend giving one a try - they are very different to, and much
better than the old Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit style games. However,
there is a problem. Most require more than two players for the best
experience. So the two of us can only play when we convince others to
join us.</p>

<p>As part of a Christmas gift we recently bought three board games that
supposedly work just fine with only two players. The other requirement
was nothing with a fantasy or science-fiction theme. We bought:
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119890/agricola-all-creatures-big-and-small">Agricola: All Creatures Great and
Small</a>;
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>; and,
a third I’ll detail in another post (it is so good it deserves a post
all to itself).</p>

<p><strong>Carcassonne</strong> is a tile placement placement game with a medieval
French theme. Each player takes a random tile (no peeking) from the
remaining pile and places it on the board. The tiles show parts of an
old countryside with roads, cities, fields, rivers and monasteries on
them. When placing a tile, it must share at least one edge with a tile
already on the board, and must continue any features in adjoining tiles.
So roads just can’t stop at the edge of a field. The tiles are built so
that there is nearly always somewhere to put them, it might just be that
none of the available positions help you much. In this way the
countryside constructed should be consistent, although it may look a
little strange (with roads running in loops and awkwardly truncated
cities). The comment at the table was that the French King should sack
the person laying out roads and cities as they were such a mess.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>After placing a tile, the player has the choice to place a meeple (a
little wooden person) on it. Depending on where the meeple is placed the
player can “claim” a city, road, field or monastery. Then once that
feature is completed the player scores depending on it’s size. However,
there are only 7 meeples per person and 72 tiles, so careful placement
is required as the meeple can’t be placed again until the feature it is
placed upon is complete. Soon players are placing tiles to maximise
their claimed features or make it harder for their opponents to finish
theirs.</p>

<p>Playing a full game takes around an hour, as players struggle to
determine best position for their new tile and then decide if it is
worth their last meeple. After four games, I haven’t got all the
strategy down yet. So far all the games have been won by building cities
in the early game, sniping small points in the middle, followed by
careful placement of farmers in the last third of the game.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/carcassonne_box.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/carcassonne_box.jpg" title="Carcassonne Box &amp; Contents" width="500" alt="Carcassonne Box &amp; Contents" /></a></p>

<p>We have played Carcassonne with both 2 and 3 players and it has always
worked well (the box says it can be played with up 5 people). All the
games have been close all the way through, often with large points
swings at the close - they have never been boring. Players concentrate
up to the end, hoping for just the right tile to bring them victory
(often a tile that allows them to join together some fields or complete
the monster sized city they have been building since the beginning).</p>

<p>Carcassonne is a great little game. Definitely worth a try (many game
stores, at least here in Malaysia, let you try before you buy). The
components are well made (out of cardboard). Once standard play has been
mastered, there are a plethora of expansions. The only downside is a
large table is required to play! Tabletop has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6VpW4Vljr8">Carcassonne playthrough
video</a> if you are
interested.</p>

<p><strong>Agricola: All Creatures Great And Small</strong> is the simplified two-player
version of the far more complex
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a> board
game. I have never played the full version of Agricola, so I can’t
comment on the differences. This game not only handles two players well,
it is designed specifically for two players and can not be played with
more.</p>

<p>The first thing you notice is the small box - it could easily be carried
around to events or even the coffeshop. The playing area required is
fairly small too and a game takes around half an hour. It is an easy
game to just pick up and play. The components are also beautiful. Thick
cardboard for the bases and little wooden animals. Also all the
cardboard pieces are doubled sided, but the non-playing sides show an
abandoned farm - a nice touch. Looking at these pieces makes me think of
other game ideas which could use them.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/agricola_box.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/agricola_box.jpg" title="Agricola Box &amp; Contents" width="500" alt="Agricola Box &amp; Contents" /></a></p>

<p>Agricola: All Creatures Great And Small is a worker placement game with
a subsistence farming theme. Each turn the players can place one of
their two worker tokens onto a spot on the worker options board. This
then blocks the other player from placing one of their workers in the
same spot. Each spot on the board provides a different set of materials.
These range from fences to build fields (long yellow rectangles) or
materials then can be used later to construct buildings, or animals to
put into your fields. Points are scored for the number of buildings and
animals on your farm.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/agricola_options.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/agricola_options.jpg" title="Agricola Worker Options" width="500" alt="Agricola Worker Options" /></a></p>

<p>The game ends after 8 turns of placing tokens, collecting materials and
making use of them (if possible). This means that our games have turned
into a sprint of farm improvement. It ends long before plans can be
fully realised (and long before it outstays its welcome). So far, one
player’s placement of workers has had little negative effect on the
other player. Perhaps this is because we haven’t worked out the proper
strategy yet. At the moment we try many different things. Often one
player focuses on expanding their farm to its maximum extent with large
fields before filling them with animals, the other creates small fields
and immediately puts animals in them, upgrading as time permits. So far
the later tactic has been more successful.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/agricola_small_farm.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/agricola_small_farm.jpg" title="Agricola Small Farm" width="500" alt="Agricola Small Farm" /></a></p>

<p>Scoring is on the basis on the number of animals and certain farm
improvements. Interesting, if a player has less than 3 of any type of
animal then a penalty is applied. If the player has more than 3 then a
bonus is given depending on the animal. Horses are worth the most, sheep
the least.</p>

<p>A quick, easy and fun game. Again, worth a try.</p>
