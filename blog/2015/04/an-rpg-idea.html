<br/><br/>
<p>A recent Facebook post by a friend of mine got me thinking. He and I
often end up in the same irregular RPG group playing <a href="http://www.modiphius.com/achtung-cthulhu.html">Achtung
Cthulhu!</a> or <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com">Apocalypse
World</a> or whatever else people feel like at
the time. In this posting he referenced someone else’s blog telling the
story of how they developed the background story to a RPG character over
time, rather than the traditional all at the start. My friend thought
this was a good idea and something he preferred to do as well. This got
me thinking about how games could handle a continuously developed player
character backstory.</p>

<p>Most games I’ve played place very little importance on your character’s
backstory. Traditionally some backstory is told at start and is then
ignored or has little impact on the game. Some games force backstory on
characters in the form of connections to other characters. Perhaps some
tabletop GMs enforce backstory, and I’ve seen people play to their
character’s history - but mostly it just seems to be a set of
guidelines. Very rarely (as in the blog post that started this train of
thought) a character’s story from before the game started is developed
as the game continues (games where the player has lost their memory and
is slowly regaining it are a notable, but cliched, exception). Many
games build constructing a backstory into the mechanics of character
creation - what better way to explain the character’s abilities.
Although this involves some early investment in a character - I have
seen make certain players uncomfortable (like my friend). Humorously, it
was possible to die during character creation in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)">Traveller</a> - so much for that investment of time and emotion!</p>

<p>By developing the backstory as you play the game it is easier to fit
your backstory to the way story turns out. The GM/computer can adjust
game to fit the emerging backstory. Perhaps new adventures can be
created riffing of new aspects to the characters’ story. Also the
history is built up as as the player becomes more comfortable with the
character. It might even increase player involvement as they see the
history increase and want to keep it going. There are a few problems too
of course. The longer the game continues, the harder it will be to find
suitable things to add to the backstory, especially for characters that
start in an inexperienced state. Also, it may lead to contradictions if
the player/GM if not careful and a new bit of backstory doesn’t match a
previously played part of the game. The ongoing backstory idea could
also be extended to become part of the game itself. Perhaps flashbacks
could be used to highlight a part of the player’s past. Or, the game
could progress inside-out like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Weapons">The Use of
Weapons</a> where the story
starts in the middle of the narrative and progresses forwards and
backwards in alternating chapters.</p>

<p>Another way to use the continuing backstory idea would be to include it
in experience/advancement systems of a RPG (tabletop or computer). This
would fix it into the structure of the game.</p>

<p>A hallmark of almost all RPGs of some form is character advancement.
There are a few I can think of that don’t use this mechanic -
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiasco_(role-playing_game)">Fiasco</a> for
example. However, for the vast majority of players (especially in
computer RPGs) improving the abilities of your character over the course
of many adventures is very important. There are various drivers for this
advancement mechanic in different games. It can be finishing a
quest/scenario, performing a particularly notable action (or failing an
action!), or just the old default of killing things (hopefully
monsters:).</p>

<p>One idea to combine these two concepts is to have the reward for
advancement being writing a sentence or two of backstory that impacts
the character’s abilities. It could be that the whole ability or skill
system is replaced by sentences of story. If particular skills are still
required or noteworthy then they could be used or underlined in these
sentences. For example, “Katniss often provided for her family by <span class="underline">hunting</span> for food in the woods near her home,
becoming proficient in use of the <span class="underline">bow</span>”.
Here, <span class="underline">bow</span> and <span class="underline">hunting</span> are skills. How the skills translate
into gameplay depends on how the game should work. For more story
oriented games then the player could justify their actions with
reference to their backstory. More numerical rules oriented games could
perhaps assign a value to each mention of a keyword with adjectives
acting as modifiers. Really “crunchy” rules based games probably
wouldn’t work well with this system. When ready to advance the player
could, for instance, come up with a sentence related to their current
situation and a sentence related to their past. These would have to be
agreed with the GM (particularly with respect to the number of keywords
and adjectives if they are important).</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>
