<h4>Funding Circle Results</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>A year on from <a href="/blog/2014/04/funding-circle-again.html">my last report</a>
and <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding Circle</a> (a peer-to-peer
lending website in the UK) is still going strong. It is approaching
nearly £600 million in funded loans. Whenever I check there is usually
50 or more loans available. It has been sometime since I saw a loan fail
to reach its funding minimum. The company has also expanded to property
development loans, albeit at a fixed rate rather than the normal auction
system (with first charge on the property).</p>

<p>So has the continued success of the company translated into improved
returns for the customers/investors? You may remember two year ago my
annual return (~2) was barely better than a bank deposit - largely due
to a rash of bankruptcies. Last year was better, the return was a
respectable 4.1 as recoveries picked up significantly. This year the
result is:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.3%<br />
After Fees: 7.3%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 6.3%</p>

<p>I consider that a very good return. It is roughly equivalent to the
return on the UK stock market
(<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EFTSE">FTSE-100</a>) over the same
time period. The gross and after fees returns are roughly consistent
with last year, and recoveries were down a little. The difference in
return is down to bad debt more than halving.</p>

<p>Over all this time my investment system has not changed, no extra money
has been invested (but all profits reinvested). I only bid on loans
under 24 months, from profitable firms that are paying tax at the
expected rate and have positive working capital. People have asked about
the “paying tax filter” - these loans are to small companies unlikely to
have access to the tax minimisation systems heard about in the press.
Thus a company showing an accounting profit that is not paying roughly
the expected tax on that profit (given various UK tax breaks -
historical losses or research costs for example) should be a warning
sign there may be something strange going on in the accounts. I don’t
have the time to dig deeper into such firms - they are just cut at this
stage.</p>

<p>So if I haven’t changed anything, why has bad debt dropped? I’m not
sure. My bad debt rate is now about average compared to all investors.
It could be better risk management by Funding Circle, or just a more
favourable UK business environment. According to their <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/statistics">statistics
page</a>, bad debt on Funding
Circle loans made in the last couple of years has trended below
expectations. However, bad debt in loans made during the first two years
(2010-11), when I was an early adopter, have been much greater than
expected. This explains why my annualised return since joining the site
is 5.1% compared to the average of 5.7% for equivalent investors.</p>

<p>Decisions should be made on future benefits not historical costs. On
that basis I’m considering adding a little extra money to the capital.
There are a few concerning issues with the UK economy and I believe the
possibility of returning to the “bad years” is non-trivial. However, if
the return from Funding Circle is around 2% in the bad years, then it
seems a reasonable risk to take. I hope.</p>
