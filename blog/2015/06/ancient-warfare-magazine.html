<p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ancient-warfare-magazine/id274583068">iTunes</a>
and from <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/podcast/">its own
site</a></p>

<p>The Ancient Warfare Magazine Podcast, as the name implies, is produced
as part of the bi-monthly <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/">paper magazine of the same
name</a>. I’ve
never read the magazine, so I can’t comment on it. One episode of the
podcast is released for each issue of the magazine (although normally a
few months later) and on the same topic, such as the <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-v.1/">Gaius
Marius</a>,
<a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-vii.4/">Logistics</a>
or the <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-viii.4/">Seleucid Empire at
War</a>.
However the content is never just a repeat of the articles. Instead the
podcasts assumes the listener has read the corresponding magazine, or is
at least familiar with the topic at hand and then starts from there. The
format is a roundtable discussion for around half an hour, going
wherever the conversation leads. Production values are high.</p>

<p>This is not a basic history of events podcast. Listeners will need a
good understanding of ancient war and battles just to start. For
instance in discussing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg
Forest</a>,
no mention is made of the battle or it’s result. Instead there is debate
on why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius">Arminus</a> decided to go
from ally to enemy of Rome, and how the battle caused terror in Rome
despite its distance. The podcast on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadochi">Hellenistic Successor
States</a> assumes listeners know
the difference between the Greek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hoplite">Hoplite
Phalanx</a> and the Macedonian
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarissa">Sarisa Phalanx</a>. Talk on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar’s</a> campaign’s
barely mentions his battles or career. It focuses entirely on his
self-aggrandisement and how he made his own luck partly with
well-trained, experienced and trusting soldiers - postulating he had no
grand plan, but just took advantage of situations as they occurred.</p>

<p>The discussion is normally quite interesting. There is a strong focus on
Greek, Hellenistic and Roman history, but not overwhelmingly so. Other
western and near eastern cultures are also represented. I would guess
the is roughly proportional to how much the remaining sources can tell
us (which is predominately Greek &amp; Roman as they tended to write things
down). However, it is disappointing that there is no mention (so far) of
cultures far from the Mediterranean - India, China, or the Americas.
Often some surprising thoughts come up. That the uniform of a Roman
legionary was anything but uniform (despite what the movies and TV
show), with the men modifying or replacing their equipment as they saw
fit. The huge advantage in steadfastness and maneuverability that came
with professional soldiers, be it Alexander’s phalanx, Athens’ rowers,
or Rome’s legions. How many generals had an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</a> complex,
comparing themselves to him (Caesar and Trajan) or mindlessly aping him - the successor kings even copied his slightly twisted neck. I was also
surprised to discover that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad">Sargon</a> claimed to have
just over 5000 soldiers when he conquered Mesopotamia - armies were
clearly much smaller 4000 years ago.</p>

<p>An informative discussion-based podcast on narrowly focused (warfare
based) topics for listeners who already know the basic details.</p>
