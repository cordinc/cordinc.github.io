<p>Wow, nearly 3 months since my last post. That regular blogging <a href="/blog/2015/01/goals-4.html">yearly
goal</a> will definitely not be met. Although
the reason for the gap is all the work being put into meeting another of
those goals - completing <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games">Concealed
Intent</a>. Today marks a huge step
towards that goal - the ability to purchase Concealed Intent through
Steam Early Access. For those not familiar with Early Access, it is for
games that are not quite finished, but are playable, and which would
benefit from player community feedback. Concealed Intent definitely
qualifies.</p>

<p>I hope to soon get back to regular posting here. In the meantime here is
an edited post announcing the release on my “work” blog at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">Jarrah
Technology</a></p>

<p><em>Republished from
<a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2015/11/19/Alive/">http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2015/11/19/Alive/</a></em></p>

<p>It’s alive. I mean it is live. This morning I set Concealed Intent to
“published” on Steam Early Access. As the page informing me of success
suggested: “insert confetti here”. If you go to the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">Steam Store
page</a> it is possible to pay
actual real money for it. It feels very weird that people might do so
(not many though after just a couple of hours:).</p>

<p>Of course, the game is not finished. Not by a long way. This is more of
a start than an end. Hopefully the feedback more players will provide
will help make the game better. Already I have seen a number of good
suggestions (from prerelease copies) - and no bugs yet!</p>

<p>There are four things I really want to get done before release (but
Steam says not to promise anything, so these are not promises!):</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 extra single-player campaign missions</li>
  <li>Steam achievements</li>
  <li>A focus point for online duels to prevent two stealth players neverfinding each other</li>
  <li>Being able to challenge your Steam friends to a game with custom time limits, rather than random match-making with whomever is online, which is probably no one :(</li>
</ul>

<p>After those four I’ll hopefully have time to add more features as
prioritised by the community.</p>

<p>There have also been a couple of YouTube Let’s Play videos posted.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=limV-arFiRA">Negative Root - Sneak Peek Concealed Intent</a> (English) - first 5 missions</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9QFj8qpZUI">Daraton - FIRST LOOK OF The Concealed Intent</a> (Deutsch|German) - tutorial and first two introductory missions</li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of YouTube and prerelease copies. I’m getting a ton of key
requests. Strangely, today is the first day I haven’t woken up to 10+
key requests. On average I refuse 80-90%. Usually because: a large
number of keys are requested; the email address is unverifiable; the
requester has no videos in the last month; I don’t see any similar games
reviewed; or, they have very few views (I look for around 80-100+ views
on videos a few weeks old). I’m not sure if any of this is normal, but
in the Steam discussion groups many gamedevs seem regretful of
profligate key giveaways. However, I’m still checking all of them taking
5-10 minutes each.</p>

<p>That adds up. With all the other little unexpected release tasks, the
time allotted to development has greatly suffered in the last week. I’ve
probably only managed the equivalent of two previous workdays progress
over the last 8 days.</p>

<p>Oh, and one last pro tip. Upload your game music to YouTube as private
videos well before your release date, to ensure people without any
rights haven’t somehow managed to “claim” your music! This happened to
me and wrecked my weekend as YouTuber’s will not post videos of games so
encumbered. Lucky, it is all fixed now and the copyright is back where
it belongs.</p>

<p>Now back to emails and hopefully some dev work too. And definitely not
hitting refresh button on the sales report, no, no, no…</p>
