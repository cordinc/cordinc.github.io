<p>On a suggestion, I recently dusted off an old copy of
<a href="http://www.prankster.com/winomega/">Omega</a> laying dormant on my hard
drive and started playing again. Never heard of this game? That is not
surprising. Omega was first released in 1987 and is a text-based
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">rogue-like</a>. One of the wave
of second-generation of rogue-likes (along with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack">Nethack</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_(video_game)">Angband</a>) that
emerged in the 80’s, Omega never became quite as well known as its
brethren. It has some nice improvements over its peers, but also adds
some annoyances. Although most of its problems are endemic to
rogue-likes from that era.</p>

<p>Old rogue-likes are text only computer
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">RPG’s</a>, where the
player is represented by little
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> symbol (usually an @) and
moves around dungeons killing monsters and acquiring treasure (all also
represented by different ASCII symbols). Each character has a set of
standard of attributes (like strength and intelligence) and levels of
ability in various class of adventurer (as a fighter, wizard, thief,
etc). Most of these games have a basic experience system, the more you
kill, the higher your level. The higher your level, the deeper you can
descend into the dungeon, and so battle tougher monsters and gather
better loot (sound familiar?). Controls are usually completely keyboard
based (not many computer mice or controllers around in the 80’s). The
WASD keys drive movement, ‘g’ for grab, ‘m’ for magic and so on.
Fighting is usually just a matter of moving your symbol on top of an
opposing monster and then a combat round ensures, damage is dealt and
afterwards you can either attack again (if the monster is still alive)
or perform another action (like run away or cast a spell). Once a player
understands what all the symbols on the screen mean, the game itself is
usually straight-forward.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/omega/bush.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/omega/bush.png" alt="A pleasant walk in the countryside" title="A pleasant walk in the countryside" /></a></p>

<p>I first started playing Omega in my second year of university, and this
may have some correlation with my poor academic results at the time (it
was also the year I became old enough to drink alcohol legally - which
may have had an impact too). I played most of the common rogue-likes
around, and while most of my friends preferred Angband, my personal
favourite was Omega. It was its scale that attracted me to the game.
There is a sense that a whole world (or at least an island) exists
around the dungeons that provide most of the usual action. There is a
town to explore which has more happening than just being a place to
restock. Outside the town is countryside to explore with villages, wild
animals, and of course the occasional dungeon too. Omega is an early
attempt at an open world. It largely succeeds given the limited
technology available in the mid 80’s.</p>

<p>There is also more than just the standard classes. You can ask the local
ruler to give you quests and become a member of the aristocracy (treated
like a class). There is a gladiator class for fighting in the town
arena. Many of these classes can be combined and most provide various
quests forcing higher-level characters out of town. Another selling
point of the game is that it is possible to play yourself. At the
beginning of the game a player can elect to answer a set of questions,
which if answered truthfully, will result in a less than heroically
attributed starting character representing the player’s personal
abilities. A nice touch to build a connection with the game, although
this can backfire a bit considering the astronomical death rates of new
characters.</p>

<p>In common with all its contemporaries, Omega is hard. Very hard, and
often unfairly so (but such is the life of an adventurer). There is
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permadeath">perma-death</a> (even save-files
are deleted on loading them) and the random number generator (RNG)
reigns supreme in its procedurally generated dungeons. Frequently it can
be near impossible to get started as the monsters in the early levels
are just too hard to defeat. You just have to hope the RNG gods are on
your side and provide a smooth ramp up in difficulty, but rarely is this
the case. In the video below I just can’t get started as I continually
run into strong monsters or instant death traps. In modern games these
are rare, because it can become quite frustrating. The response is often
to try farming early characters, running through the low levels
carelessly fast until the infant death phase has passed.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, Omega suffers from RNG balance problems more than most. The
early game seems particularly hard, and the late game much too easy.
After a characters survives a few hours and reach level 10 or so, then
they are able to cruise through nearly all challenges. This and the
inventory system are perhaps the main reasons the game need became
well-known. In a unique system (at least I haven’t seen it used before,
or since) picking up an item does not mean you are carrying it. Instead
it is “up in the air” and the game goes into inventory mode, where you
put it in a particular slot: hand, feet, belt, pack etc. If there is
already something already in that slot then it is swapped with the new
item and now becomes the “up in the air” item. Leave an item “up in the
air” when finished and it is dropped. It is supposed to simulate the
fiddly process of organising all your items in real life. It succeeds,
but I’m not sure that is a good thing for the game. Still, players
quickly get used to it after a little practice, unfortunately most
players do not persist and just bash monsters in Angband instead.</p>

<p>These early rogue-likes are a hive of experimentation. They are the
indie games of their time. So many ideas were thrown together by people
trying to recreate their tabletop RPG sessions. For me, Omega succeeded
more than it failed. It feels like there is a world continuing along
regardless of the player actions. This isn’t true of course, but it is
the impression that counts. This is evident by many of the games that
come after Omega. They may not be inspired directly by it, but they are
inspired by the same original sources as Omega. The basic motivation of
the creators is the equivalent. Thus we now have expansive open worlds
like Skyrim. Meanwhile the rogue-like genre itself has only become
stronger over the last 30 years. I can recommend that game designers not
old enough to have played these old rogue-likes when they were popular,
give at least one of them a try now.</p>

<p>Omega can bee downloaded for free from
<a href="http://www.prankster.com/winomega/">here</a>, the sourcecode is also
available (along with some documentation, tips &amp; spoilers) from
<a href="http://www.alcyone.com/binaries/omega/">here</a>.</p>
