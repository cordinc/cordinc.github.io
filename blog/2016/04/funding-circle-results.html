<h4>Funding Circle Results</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>Time for the <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">annual report</a> on the
performance of my peer-to-peer lending investment. <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/">Funding
Circle</a> is doing very well: they have
doubled the total amount loaned out; opened a US website; and, now can
be included as part of a tax-free ISA in the UK. Some of that extra
money loaned is mine. After last yearâ€™s good returns (much better than
other UK investments), I decided to add some extra money to my account.
So in retrospect, was that the right decision? Have the investors done
as well as the company?</p>

<p>Here are the returns for the last UK tax year:</p>

<p>Gross: 10.0%<br />
After Fees: 8.8%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 10.4%</p>

<p>Wow, my best year, and by a long way. 10.4% is an extremely respectable
return, especially in a year where the FTSE-100 share indexed has
declined. According to Funding Circle my lifetime (5 years) return is
currently 6.4%, also very good.</p>

<p>Gross returns have risen around 2%, with fees roughly matching the rise.
However, the biggest gain has been net bad debt/recoveries. In the last
year I have only had a single loan go bad - much better than previous
years. Recoveries have been huge! Larger than the loss and even larger
than the fees paid this year. Thus a total return higher than the gross
return! Kudos to Funding Circle team as they have now recovered about
half the bad debt from previous years.</p>

<p>So with that kind of return I should be adding more money to the
account, right? Unfortunately not. I manually choose all the loan offers
joined, as opposed to using the autobid tool. As my criteria has
tightened (small, guaranteed, short term loans to profitable, tax paying
companies with good credit rating and acceptable working capital), my
bad debt rate has dropped below the site average, despite making over a
hundred loans per year.</p>

<p>Since a rule change in the way Funding Circle works at the end of last
year (fixed returns rather than an auction), it has become increasingly
difficult to find loans to fund. This is not due to a lack of loans
available, or even a decrease in their quality. Instead it is because
the loans are filled in a matter of hours rather than days. Now most of
the best loans are already filled and closed before I even get a chance
to see them. Most frustrating.</p>

<p>As a result I have built up a surplus of non-invested money on Funding
Circle. Money that is not earning any interest (for me anyway). Enough
to fund several weeks worth of loans under the old system, but
currently, and for several months, there have not been enough
opportunities. My options are to relax my lending criteria, or start
using their autobid tool (effectively lowering my standards anyway).
Alternatively, I can accept my time on the site is over and start to
slowly empty my account (it will take a long time to close out some of
the loans, even with their secondary market). I have yet to decide what
to do.</p>

<p>Tune in next year to see what happens!</p>
