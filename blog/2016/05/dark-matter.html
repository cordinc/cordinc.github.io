<p>I’m constantly on the lookout for good sci-fi TV shows. I grew up
regularly watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek">Star Trek</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake%27s_7">Blake’s 7</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Dr
Who</a>. I love the imaginative
and/or expansive stories sci-fi allows, so I’m always willing to give a
new show a try.</p>

<p>Recently I started watching <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4159076/">Dark
Matter</a>, a new show on the US Syfy
channel that has been garnering a few good reviews. I didn’t like it and
only watched 3 episodes before stopping. This is very unusual for me,
normally I will go through an entire season. However, in this case it
seemed very unlikely the show could recover - plus there is so much
other great TV to watch. The acting ranged from acceptable (most of the
leads) to poor (most of the guests), but the characters were cliched
(quiet Asian martial arts expert prefers swords to guns - tired) as was
the dialogue and plots. I found myself calling out what would be said
next - and was correct way too often. It also seemed to be produced at a
very small scale. The main spaceship was dark and empty, as were planets
and stations. In my opinion the show is not very good, or is it?</p>

<p>After considering it for a while, I decided that if this TV show aired
15 years ago during the Star Trek: Next Generation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Bablyon
5</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_SG-1">Stargate:
SG1</a> era, I would have
considered it as quite good. I certainly would have given it much longer
to prove itself. Both Babylon 5 &amp; Stargate had the same just acceptable
level of acting, plots and production at the start. Star Trek TNG was
actually bad for its first season. However, they all grew into great
shows. I have particularly fond memories of the episodes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_Command_(Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation)">Chain of
Command</a>
from Star Trek and <a href="http://babylon5.wikia.com/wiki/Severed_Dreams">Severed
Dreams</a> from Babylon 5.
Dark Matter would stand up well against the early seasons of those
shows. What has changed?</p>

<p>Well TV, including sci-fi TV has gotten much better, and shows have to
be good from the start now to even have a hope of success. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica_(2004_TV_series)">Battlestar
Galactica</a>
started with the incredibly good episode “33” (although I still pretend
the last season and a half never happened). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones">Game of
Thrones</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expanse_(TV_series)">The
Expanse</a>
similarly started with well-polished episodes and a strong story. There
is no time to get writers up to speed and let actors grow into their
characters. Showmakers’ need to know where the story is going from the
start. Production quality has also greatly increased. Presumably with a
corresponding increase in cost, although perhaps not with current CGI
techniques.</p>

<p>All this is a long way of saying, I am still regularly amazed at the
quality of modern TV. The competition is so good a show like Dark Matter
feels very dated and behind the times. A show I might have loved not
long ago is now a fast reject.</p>
