<p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dan-carlins-hardcore-history/id173001861">iTunes</a>
and from <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">its own
site</a>, this 5-part
series is a free subset of a larger set of history podcasts. Having only
listened to the 5 Mongol episodes, I can’t talk to the larger sequence.</p>

<p>At first glance of the name and promotional images, Wrath of the Khans -
Hardcore History, seems like it might be a podcast playing up the more
sensationalist parts of history. Luckily this is not the case. I imagine
the presentation aims to bring in as many listeners as possible to an
otherwise serious history series. Written and presented by the
professional broadcaster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Carlin">Dan
Carlin</a>, these 5 well produced
episodes (totaling 8.5 hours) address the history of the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire">Mongol
Empire</a> in the 1200’s.
Starting with the later exploits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan">Genghis
Khan</a> and ending with
breakup of the empire at the hands of his great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>The podcast starts with a long introduction on how people view history
differently depending on how much empathy they feel for the people at
the time. In a well reasoned argument Dan suggests that the further we
get from events, the more disassociated we become and the easier it is
to reassess aspects of historical events without reference to the
suffering people experienced at the time. Thus it is hard to talk about
the Nazis without reference to their attempts at genocide. However,
Romans can be discussed without mentioning the devastation visited upon
the people they conquered (possibly genocidal in a few instances). The
Mongols seem to fall at the boundary of this change. In the west, the
Mongols seem quite distant. Although Dan recounts the story of his
Chinese university history lecturer admonishing him for failing to
consider the damage done to civilians in creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Mongolica">Pax
Mongolica</a>. Interesting
stuff, but perhaps an aside based on the author’s interests rather than
something integral to the story of the Mongols. Other than the fact they
killed an absolutely amazingly huge number of people. Comparable in
numbers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll">death toll from World War
2</a>, despite
the Mongol Empire forming in a time when the world population was much
lower and the methods of killing much more primitive. The Mongols of
Genghis Khan come across as quite a ruthless and expansionary people.
Dan Carlin suggests they saw all non-steppe people as subhuman. He also
points out that civilian atrocities in war had occurred many times
before (and since). The Mongols were exceptional only in scale.</p>

<p>The Mongol Empire starts with Genghis Khan uniting the tribes of the
eastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe">steppe</a> for the first
time. Previous steppe tribes had often harassed or conquered nearby
lands. In the west we talk about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthia">Parthians</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians">Scythians</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths">Goths</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns">Huns</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty">Turks</a> and others. In
Asia there is a similar list of other nomadic tribes - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">Great Wall
of China</a> was built
to try and keep them out. The Mongols were similar to earlier tribes in
that their armies were fast (consisting nearly entirely of light
cavalry), could live of the the land, and well-trained (steppe people
were taught to ride and fight from childhood). They differed from
earlier invasions as their armies were larger (drawing from many
tribes), well disciplined (the penalty for minor infractions was death,
the penalty for major infractions was death for you and your entire
unit), and well led. Genghis Khan is said to have a large network of
spies providing intelligence on his enemies. There are also many stories
of Mongol armies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Kalka_River">refusing battle until the battleground better suited
them</a>. They
were able to adapt their tactics to changing circumstances. The Mongols
learned siegecraft, successfully besieging many cities, and it is
believed they were the first to bring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mohi">gunpowder weapons to
Europe</a>, after learning of
them from the Chinese.</p>

<p>In the 13th century the Mongols probably had the most powerful army in
existence, and they used it regularly. In under a century they conquered
multiple kingdoms with relative ease to create the largest empire by
land area in history. They conquered two of the three Chinese kingdoms
at the time (the third was defeated a few years later by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan">Kublai
Khan</a> after the breakup of
the empire). They subdued the previously expansionary Central Asian and
Middle Eastern Sultanates all the way to the Mediterranean. An invasion
into Europe reached as far as Hungary. Apparently the Mongols had an 18
year plan to conquer Europe all the way to the Atlantic (they already
had spies in place). However just a few years into the plan, the Mongol
leader Ogedei Khan (Genghis’ son) died and the army had to return to
Mongolia for a new Khan’s election. It is an intriguing counterfactual
to consider events if Ogedei lived another decade, so the invasion of
Europe could continue. Europe was relatively weak and divided at the
time. It is hard to imagine there would have been more resistance than
in the east.</p>

<p>While the empire stayed united under a single Khan (Genghis, followed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogedei_Khan">Ogedei</a>, then Genghis’
grandsons), they suffered no serious military setbacks. The end of the
Empire came from internal divisions - the method of succession used by
the Mongols seems to have been a great cause of internal friction.
Although the transition from Genghis to Ogedei was smooth (as Genghis
made his wishes clear in advance), all the others were contentious.
Mongols used an elective monarchy - at the death of the previous Khan
all the relevant nobles convened to elect a new Khan. I can imagine this
worked well at the tribal level when all the possible leaders spent most
of their time close together. It doesn’t work so well for a continent
spanning empire. Take a look at a map - Hungary to Mongolia is a very
long way! After Ogedei, it took 5 years to elect a new Khan, as one of
the electors refused to attend, believing that the likely new Khan would
order his death. When the expected Khan,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyuk_Khan">Guyuk</a>, finally took command
he died soon after, leading to another 3 year span without a Khan.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongke_Khan">Mongke Khan</a> stabilised the
Empire for a while and even expanded a little, but at his death in 1259
the Mongol Empire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Mongol_Empire">split into four separate
parts</a>.
Thus ending this podcast series, but not the end of the Mongols. The
descendants of Genghis ruled much of Asia for centuries thereafter.</p>

<p>I could much more to write about this excellent podcast on an
interesting part of history (and a largely unknown to me). However, this
post is already long enough. Well worth a download and listen.</p>
