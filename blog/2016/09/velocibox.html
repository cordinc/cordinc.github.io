<p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.shawnbeckgames.com/velocibox">Velocibox</a> describes itself as
a hardcore twitch-heavy endless-runner. That is definitely all true.
After a couple of hours of play I have reached level 2 once (getting
through level 1 takes seconds if done correctly). This game requires the
reflexes of a fighter-pilot! It is super-hard. It is also well-designed
and easy to just keep playing.</p>

<p>Originally this review was to be for a different game. However, after
playing that other game for a bit I realised not only did I not enjoy
it, I also didn’t think it was a good game. After a few moments thought
it was decided: I was not going to spend my time writing about a failed
game. Instead I came back to Velocibox, a similar game from a few years
ago.</p>

<p>Velocibox is a simple game, well-executed. You are a box moving through
a tunnel of obstacles. Your speed through the tunnel is fixed, constant
and very fast. Obstacles appear in the distance and are then on top of
you in a second or less. The players need to react quickly or they will
hit an obstacle causing insta-death. To avoid the obstacles, there are
just three controls: move left; move right; and, flip to the ceiling.
That is it, just three keys. It is easy just to keep a finger poised
over each of the keys and press when required. Sounds simple, but is
ohhh so hard. The aim of the game is collect other boxes that are
positioned throughout the level. Collect 6 (by running into them) and
progress to the next level. This means there are two styles of play.
There is fast and loose as the player attempts to collect the first 6
boxes that appear regardless of how difficult. Alternatively, the more
cautious player can wait for easy to reach cubes, but then takes the
risk of having to deal with more obstacles.</p>

<p>And that is the game. Personally, I have seen a great deal of level 1
and a few seconds of level 2. Although, I have watched other players
absolutely crush this game, speeding towards level 8 or 9. Thus I am
fairly confident there are no extras, or added mechanics later in the
game. The gameplay stays the same throughout, it is just that the
obstacles become more elaborate and the boxes harder to reach. It also
means I know it is possible to complete the whole game in a couple of
minutes.</p>

<p>The trick to the game is recognising that there are patterns in the
obstacles. Each level is different each time it is played, but there are
a set number of obstacles patterns. Good players learn the moves to get
through a set of obstacles, then the game becomes about speedily and
accurately identifying which randomly chosen pattern is about to start
and executing the correct moves. It sounds simple, because it is.
However, it is still hard to achieve and (for most people) requires some
willingness to learn the game.</p>

<p>What makes Velocibox stand out is its good design. Since the gameplay is
about being fast, everything about the game aids the impression of
speed. The controls are responsive. The game starts quickly. When the
game ends, it is possible to start the next one with only a couple of
seconds gap. There is no impediment to just playing over and over again.
This is great, giving a real “just one more try” feel - it is not like
it takes long. Seriously, the fastest reflex I learned during this game
was hitting restart scant milliseconds after losing and starting again.
The design of the tunnel also gives the impression of speed, with the
regular seams distorting into curves as they zoom past. There is fast
music. The UI is spare and unobtrusive, particularly since it is not
really required.</p>

<p>With just three controls, there is no thinking about where you fingers
are positioned or what to do next. Nor does the player need to worry
about an special extras - it is just the obstacles and the boxes.
Everything can be focused on the game. This is a simple game that knows
what it wants to achieve and totally focussed on it. It is unashamedly
simple and not scared into doing unnecessary things. If you want a fast
reflex tester with some learning potential, this game is for you,
otherwise move on.</p>

<p>Velocibox is on Steam and Itch.io for PC, Mac and Linux for US$7.99
(<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/317710/">Steam page</a> or <a href="https://shawnbecktp.itch.io/velocibox">Itch.io
page</a>). It has been bundled many
times.</p>
