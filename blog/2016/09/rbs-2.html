<p>Part 1 is <a href="/blog/2016/08/rbs-1.html">available here</a>.</p>

<p>As the <a href="/blog/2016/08/rbs-1.html">SCRS project</a> at RBS began to come to
a finish, the team started to disperse. I was the last technical person
to leave and to prevent me leaving RBS entirely, the SCRS project manger
arranged for my contract to transfer over to the Sales Account Opening
(SAO) project so I could still be around if SCRS needed me. They didn’t,
so my last 9 months at RBS were spent on the largest most dysfunctional
IT project I have ever seen.</p>

<p>SAO aimed to allow potential and existing customers of RBS to open
accounts online. Current accounts, savings, credit cards, overdrafts,
the whole range of retail account should be available. Basically it was
a set of webpages that took a customer’s information, and then passed it
through to various backend systems to actually create the account and
send out any required paper forms. At the time many banks were setting
up similar systems - now it is expected functionality for a bank’s
online presence, but still fairly new for most banks in early 2004 when
I started on the project. The technical difficulty was not particularly
high, but greatly complicated by non-technical factors. The final system
had to integrate with the existing customer database and credit checking
systems. The information collected had to meet anti-money laundering,
fraud and terrorism laws (collectively referred to as “Know Your
Customer” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a>).
Security and reliability had to be bulletproof as this was a public
website and must inspire confidence in potential customers. The site
also needed to look pretty, well-designed and enticing. The webpages
needed to conform to UK &amp; EU disability laws, so blind people or people
unable to use a mouse or a raft of other issues should still be able to
use the system easily. Also, RBS owned a number of subsidiary banks.
They would all use this system too since they all shared the same
backend. This meant the webpages had to change branding, wording and
structure to match the bank being viewed.</p>

<p>From my point of view one of the biggest problems was management. The
project was huge. At one point I counted over a 100 technical people
permanently assigned to the project, plus managers on top. Then there
were consultants in various forms: web designers; security experts;
usability experts; QA; and more. All this was across three main
locations: Edinburgh, London and Bangalore. There were also small (under
9 people) teams in Dublin and Leicester. The budget seemed endless and
it was super high profile. We were told the project was initiated by the
CEO and he was taking a personal interest in the process. It was kind of
a big deal. With something this big and important it all became
unmanageable and unruly quite quickly.</p>

<p>I joined the project just as development work began. My position in
London was officially Java Team Leader. I managed a team of 4-5
programmers (two of which came from SCRS) creating an example system for
the webpages. The idea was this would form a template followed by the
mass of coders in Bangalore when creating the real pages. We had to work
out a way to transition between pages based on what information was
needed next, how to integrate with the interfaces provided for various
backend systems and how to have the site rearrange itself depending on
which bank was being viewed. There were three other teams in London: the
team creating the external interfaces to the backbend databases; the
page design team working out what needed to be on each page; and the QA
team. We all sat near each other.</p>

<p>My team’s task was completed after a few months and we didn’t have much
to do. We helped deal with any issues arising from the work being sent
to India, created tools including a comprehensive, but complex build
system, and worked with the developers at the printing office in
Leicester to get the printing of letters automated. I asked to be
released from my contract after 6 months on the project, but my direct
manager refused. Normally this would not be a problem, I could just move
on with a month’s notice. However, my hopeless agent (who I never worked
with again) created a fixed term contract, rather than the standard one
month’s notice, so I had to wait an extra 3 months. That manager wanted
me and my team around as contingency in case urgent problems arose. Such
problems regularly did occur, but never enough to keep us fully
occupied. I read a lot of web magazines.</p>

<p>I also helped out other teams. In particular I worked with the Indians
temporarily co-located with us, assisting them understanding what we had
done and why. These guys were consultants from one of the large Indian
outsourcing firms. It worked just like my experiences with other
consulting firms. Smart and talented people were sent to sit with us in
our office. They gave us confidence everything would be fine as any of
them could be part of our team. Then they went back to their main office
and most of the actual work was done by much worse programmers. Nice to
know consulting firms are the same worldwide. Although one of them did
provide one of the funnier work moments. A young Indian consultant was
saying how great it was to travel around from his London base. He was
particularly impressed by Egypt and asked a quieter member of my team if
he had been there. This guy (previously from SCRS) was an Israeli man
nearing retirement. He replied that he had been to Egypt, in 1973, and
did not enjoy himself. Oblivious, the consultant carried on espousing
the country’s virtues.</p>

<p>Towards the end of my time at RBS the Indian consultants in Bangalore
sent us photos of their office. We sent back some of hours. It was
illuminating. Their offices were modern, open spaces, with large desks
and decent equipment (flat screens, etc). Ours were run down, crumbly,
ancient offices near Aldgate East, scheduled for demolition (as they
since have been - the site is now apartments). The offices were a set of
50’s buildings threaded together into a warren of weirdly shaped spaces.
We used CRT monitors (the last place I worked with these) and all our
PCs were at least a few years old. Though the place did have a decent
canteen. Apparently it even used to have a bank branch and pub in the
basement, but these were shut down a couple of years before I arrived.</p>

<p>As the end of my contract approached the project began to head off the
rails. A specialist project manager was hired - his experience was
bringing out-of-control projects back on track. Time and budget
allocations were being greatly exceeded. Part of this was just the size
of the project and how hard it was to get everyone working together.
Partly it was due to mid-project changes. I remember being part of one
impromptu meeting were the latest changes were being discussed. It
seemed that the CEO had seen our latest iteration and wanted a few
modifications. Unfortunately, the changes meant the site would not
longer meet various legal requirements. A concise paraphrasing of the
conversation is “the CEO wants this change. That is illegal. But the CEO
wants it. It is illegal!” I left the management team to untangle that
Gordian knot. At least that meeting was informal so I could just leave.
Most were not, and there was at least one hour long meeting per day,
often more. I started taking food to them and eating at the table if it
went over an hour. This had the benefit of keeping me alert and the
other participants tended to become more focussed on finishing too.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/rbs_pins.png" alt="Motivated?" title="Motivated?" /></p>

<p>When my contract expired, I left with no regrets. The RBS IT
organisation was too bureaucratic for me. I didn’t even have another
contract lined up. I didn’t care, I’d had enough of meetings and forms
and arguing about budgets. At this stage I hadn’t yet completely given
up on becoming a manager, but it was getting close. About a year later
the RBS account opening system was available online. I took a look and
saw some of my work evident (at least in the way the pages flowed and
the html suggested my branched branding was there too, but I couldn’t be
sure). There was also quite a bit missing. The project came in about 6
months late by lowering the scope of work. I assume the rest was added
in over later months, but I never looked again.</p>

<p>Some other points about my first time at RBS:</p>

<ul>
  <li>As I was leaving, I interviewed at RBS Markets, their investment
banking division. They seemed to have a very low opinion of their
corporate and retail brethren.</li>
  <li>While waiting in the office lobby for that interview, a set of
security people can through and cleared everyone, except me sitting
in a corner. Then the bank CEO and Prince Charles walked through. I
felt like having a few words with the CEO about how his desired
changes to SAO were illegal, but stayed still.</li>
  <li>HR seemed aware there was a morale problem. Although, instead of
making conditions better they regularly ran “fun” and “quirky”
campaigns. Putting up colourful motivational banners across the
entrance, or handing out buttons that said “willing to play” to
employees.</li>
  <li>Nearly all the non-management, non-Java people wanted to learn Java.
I was constantly asked by database or COBOL people to help
facilitate them into a Java job on my project, despite them having
no experience.</li>
  <li>IBM salespeople seem to be able to hypnotise corporate IT managers
into signing silly contracts at will. I saw evidence of that back in
Australia, at RBS, and the next job too.</li>
  <li>The standard stack on my projects was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Struts_1">Java
Struts</a> frontend
hosted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_WebSphere">IBM
WebSphere</a>. Integration
with backend mainframes was through a bespoke web services system
using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Axis">Axis</a>. Any local
(non-mainframe) data was on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_DB2">DB2</a>.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant">Ant</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JUnit">JUnit</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CruiseControl">CruiseControl</a> were
common. Design was done in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Software">Rational
tool-set</a>,
including source control in ClearCase.</li>
  <li>A team member said later that a particular moment made a big
difference to their career. We needed to write a web service to
interface with the printers. I gave the work to that guy, and he was
worried as it was his first big programming task. He was asking me
lots of questions about how it should be designed. I told him, just
do what you think is best, and if its no good, you will do it again
and better. He told me that my confidence in his ability to do the
job was a huge boost (as he was not so confident), and it was
well-placed because he did it just fine the first time.</li>
