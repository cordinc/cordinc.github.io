<p>Time for some short reviews of small games.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/447310/">Paper Train Traffic</a>
(US$1.99)</strong> has the player control the signalling for a set of train
tracks - their job is simple, prevent crashes! The player controls are
beautifully straightforward. Click a light (normally only a few for each
level) to switch it between “go” and “stop”, or switch tracks. There is
also a boost button to make the stage go quicker and points are awarded
on how often this is used. The art is a cute and beautiful pen style
reminiscent of school doodles. Each level takes a couple of minutes at
most, but with 300 of them there is a great deal of content here. Levels
can not be memorised as the sequence of trains is random, sometimes
making a level trivially easy, while other times the same level is near
impossible. Despite this the game is immensely enjoyable in its fast
pace with a just one more try quality.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/capsules/1/fake_colours_full.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/capsules/1/fake_colours.png" alt="Fake Colours" title="Fake Colours" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/334300/">Fake Colours</a> (US$4.99,
previously bundled)</strong> is a casual puzzler in which three cubes must be
moved across a small square grid to set destinations. The difficulty
comes in that each cube can only be moved onto squares which match its
colour. There are 30 levels of increasing difficulty as various extra
little additions increase the challenge. The game itself looks good and
production levels are acceptable, although the non-game screens are a
little rough graphically. The controls are clunky, but that does not
matter as there does not appear to be a time limit (other than for
scoring purposes). A decent little challenging diversion, but ultimately
forgettable.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/capsules/1/csd.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/capsules/1/csd.png" alt="Cook Serve Delicious" title="Cook Serve Delicious" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/247020/">Cook, Serve, Delicious</a>
(US$9.99, previously bundled)</strong> is an arcade restuarant simulator. The
player serves customers by striking a set of keys (or mouse clicks) that
produce the desired menu item. It is really a game about being able to
quickly and accurately strike the desired combos (the mouse is way too
slow). Thus I am very bad at it. It is incredibly well produced, clearly
considerable effort has been made to make playing an enjoyable
experience. There are many progression options (different menu items,
new equipment, achievements, etc) gradually unlocked to keep players
interested. Plus there is a campaign and weekly challenges. An exemplar
in its genre.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/capsules/1/10000000.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/capsules/1/10000000.png" alt="10000000" title="10000000" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/227580/">10000000</a> (US$4.99,
previously bundled)</strong> is a fast-paced match-3 game, with retro 8-bit
graphics. You play as a dungeon adventurer fighting monsters, opening
treasure chests and upgrading your castle. Each of these tasks is
completed by matching 3 or more items in a grid, which is manipulated by
shifting icons in their columns. This game was way too fast for me. How
long you can play each dungeon is determined by how quickly you can
construct matches. There are many powerups and improvements players can
earn to aid them in their dungeoneering. However, none of it was enough
to keep my attention. I’m not a huge fan of match-3 games, and this
didn’t game overcome that bias.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/capsules/1/last_hope.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/capsules/1/last_hope.png" alt="Last Hope" title="Last Hope" /></a></p>

<p><strong><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/434020/">Last Hope - Tower Defence</a>
(US$8.99)</strong> is a tower defence game (surprise!) set in a zombie
apocalypse where mainly native Americans defend their villages against
the horde. Although the theme seems very lightly applied. There are
robots and automatically targeting ballistas. Also, if a character is
wounded or even killed by a zombie, they are not converted. They are
just resurrected a minute or so later. Thus there is no fear of
zombification and multiplying enemies, which seems to me a core part of
zombie games. The gameplay is standard casual tower defence: place
installations in the path of the enemy; try to channel them; upgrade at
the end of a mission. There is no innovation here. Also there seems to
be little polish. A couple of bugs caused me to restart. The graphics
and animation always seem just a little bit off. The text at one point
requested a mobile gesture when playing on my PC. This is clearly a
mobile game ported to PC with little effort. Skip it.</p>
