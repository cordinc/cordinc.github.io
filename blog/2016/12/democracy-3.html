<p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p>Is a one-party state or assassination in your future political career?
Find out in the entertaining (and occasionally thought-provoking)
<a href="http://positech.co.uk/democracy3/">Democracy 3</a> as you pander to those
population nodes, or maybe just reorganise the country to better
optimise the demographics.</p>

<p>The aim of Democracy 3 is to win elections. To do this the player
decides upon, and to what extent, various policies should be
implemented. Consequences flow through a vast array of other policies,
possible events and demographics. Finally all the changes feed into to a
popularity score determining the likelihood of re-election.</p>

<p>The game is played out over 3 month turns, leading towards regularly
spaced elections. There are limits on what the player can do each turn.
The more controversial a policy, the greater the political capital
required to implement it. At the start of each turn the player’s
political capital is replenished depending on the loyalty of the cabinet
(who can be fired &amp; hired as desired). There is never quite enough to do
all that is needed. Some policies require little capital, like Community
Policing, other require so much I have never been able to enact them,
like an Inheritance Tax.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/democracy3/main_full.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/democracy3/main.png" alt="Graph optimisation FTW" title="Graph optimisation FTW" /></a></p>

<p>The mass of interconnected policies, events and people lead this to
becoming essentially a game about graph optimisation. Luckily, I enjoy
such games, and for a few hours this well-made game was no exception.
Such simulations often collapse as they are built to teach a certain
ideology. However, I could not detect that issue here. There are a wide
array of possible policies ranging from the obvious like policing and
education, through to the controversial like whether evolution is taught
in schools, or even the unlikely such as anti-gravity research and
banning divorce. The linkages between nodes appear reasonable.</p>

<p>The internal model seems to be designed more as a play-pit. After a few
games, the fun comes increasingly from just trying out some of the more
extreme possibilities. It is possible to build a socialist utopia,
police state, or theocracy and still win elections. A big reason for
this and one of the main advantages of the design, is that it is
possible to change the demographics of the country. Teaching creationism
in schools makes the religious demographic segment grow, taxing the rich
makes them more likely to leave. Players can warp virtual society to
their ends.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/democracy3/connections_full.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/democracy3/connections.png" alt="How it all fits together" title="How it all fits together" /></a></p>

<p>A game like this is highly dependent on a smooth user interface, and
Democracy 3 largely succeeds on this requirement. The main screen holds
all the information needed to see the current state of the game.
Hovering over an item highlights its inputs/outputs so it is immediately
clear how it influences the system. However, sometimes some thought is
needed to determine whether a linkage is providing a useful effect or
not. For instance, a positive impact on Pollution means a worse
environment, but a similar flow to Environment means a better
environment. After a while these switches become less confusing and
easier to spot.</p>

<p>Democracy 3 has a real “just one more turn” feel to it. Many times I
kept playing longer than expected to see what would happen next or if I
could keep up my popularity. Unfortunately what often happened was
assassination or runaway success. The system always seems unstable at
first (why do players start so unpopular when they are supposed to have
just won an election?). Although after playing for a while, the country
usually flies off towards one of two steady(ish) states: collapse (and
death) or unwavering electoral popularity.</p>

<p>In one game my country had 10 years of greater than 50% budget deficits
with a C credit rating, but it didn’t cause problems. How is that debt
funded? The economy was wrecked with GDP constantly falling. Despite
this, I kept being re-elected with 90% majorities. My policies of
universal health-care, extensive education and a large police force
keeping everyone happy. Cabinet also just seemed an annoyance with
little impact and events began to repeat themselves. I started clicking
“Next” without making any policy changes - year after year of inaction
and my popularity never waned. Perhaps you are not supposed to play that
long?</p>

<p>I enjoyed playing this game, and it made me think for a few hours.
However, I do not think I will be playing it again soon. There is
definitely fun in working out how the internal model works, but not much
longevity after that. It seems to be too deterministic for a realistic
simulation. Extreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory">black swan
events</a> (either
domestic or foreign) don’t seem to play a big enough role. Still it can
be fun to try creating some radical political cultures. It is definitely
worth picking up when cheap in a bundle. Plus it lets you play as
Australia!</p>

<p>Democracy 3 is on the Steam
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/245470/">store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux
at US$24.99. There are many DLC products available and the game has been
bundled.</p>
