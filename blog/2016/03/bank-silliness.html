<h4>Bank Silliness</h4>

<p>After telling the below story to a couple of people, they thought it
should be shared more widely.</p>

<p>Scene: I call my UK business bank over an issue I’m having with a bank
transfer. After waiting on hold for several minutes, I reach a Customer
Service Representative and verify my identity. They ask why I’m calling.</p>

<p>Me: Hi, I can’t transfer money to an account at another bank.</p>

<p>Customer Service Rep (CSR): Sorry to hear that, let me check your
account… Hmmm, yes, there appears to be a block on your account. It
seems we had some returned mail so as a fraud precaution a transaction
and mail block was placed on your account in December. Someone tried to
call at the time, but was unable to contact you. I can remove the block.</p>

<p>Me: Hang on, December? I have received mail since then, I have a letter
from from you in my hand right now.</p>

<p>CSR: When is it dated?</p>

<p>Me: February, it is the February account statement.</p>

<p>CSR: Oh, that’s strange, let me check… Ah, yes. The fraud prevention
block is on the credit card card account. Your current account does not
have a block.</p>

<p>Me: So to because some mail was returned you stopped my credit card
mail, but my current account mail was still sent and all arrived fine.
That doesn’t seem right.</p>

<p>CSR: They are on different systems. The block only applies to one.</p>

<p>Me: So one system thought there was a fraud issue, while the other
thought it was all fine and kept sending mail?</p>

<p>CSR: Yes.</p>

<p>Me: Ok… I don’t really need the mail anyway, can you send less?</p>

<p>CSR: Yes, we can put you on our paperless plan, then you will only
received credit card statements and any current account statement that
includes a fee we have charged.</p>

<p>Me: But you charge me a fee every month.</p>

<p>CSR: Um, yes, that’s right.</p>

<p>Me: So you will send exactly the same amount of mail on the paperless
system as you do now.</p>

<p>CSR: Yes.</p>

<p>Me: Ok, don’t bother then, just please remove the block. My mail arrives
fine.</p>

<p>CSR: That is done, anything else I can help you with.</p>

<p>Me: No, bye.</p>

<p>I may have been a little abrupt there at the end. My apologies to the
customer service rep who was stuck in a bad situation. However, this is
just silliness from one of my banks and sadly not recently out of
character. I am becoming increasingly irritated by their strange
requirements, poor customer service, and outright refusal to do many
tasks other banks perform without issue. They also advertise themselves
as an international bank, but this appears to manifest itself largely in
their marketing copy. I certainly have trouble discerning much
international service. Four years ago I recommended this bank to another
person. This year I suggested another person completely avoid them. I
hope to soon take my own advice.</p>

<p>Also, I screen my calls, so that person may have called in December but
definitely did not leave a message - I check them all.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>
