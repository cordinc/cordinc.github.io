<p>Here is the second and final posting on gaming podcasts - this one
looking at game design podcasts.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://thegamedesignroundtable.com">Game Design Roundtable</a></em> is
hosted by a few working game designers including Rob Daviau (one of the
two people behind the excellent board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1">Pandemic
Legacy</a>).
There is no set structure. Sometimes the hosts just have a chat catching
up on what they are working on. Sometimes they interview another game
designer from various parts of the gaming industry (boardgames, card
games or computer games). Although my favourites are the “Listener
Mailbag” episodes - a whole 40-60 minutes of the hosts answering
listener questions, from quite specific game design problems to business
issues. This is a really good series and I learn something new with each
episode. It also should make indie computer gamedevs thankful for not
being in the board game industry - the success of Pandemic Legacy aside,
it seems like a much tougher way to make a living.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.designer-notes.com">Designer Notes</a></em> is a series of
interviews presented by Soren Johnson, the lead designer of Civilization
IV (although he does not actually conduct all the interviews). Each
month an experienced game designer (usually from the computer game
industry) is questioned at length about how they got into game design
and the course of their career. While the names of the designers may not
be well-known, the games they have worked on certainly are! I have
listened to about half the series and heard from the designers of World
of Warcraft, Crusader Kings 2, Triple Town and Planescape. The episodes
tend to be quite long, some going past the 2 hour mark. There is
definitely a great deal of game design talent present, but unfortunately
little in the way of usable information for the aspiring designer.
Instead the questions focus more on personality, personal history, how
careers in the industry progress (or meander, as it appears), and the
stories of how certain games were made. Still very interesting
(depending on the interviewee), although I tend to listen only when
doing something else at the same time.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://slangdesign.com/rppr/category/game-designer-workshop/">RPPR Game Designers
Workshop</a></em>
is a sub-series within the RPPR podcast. RPPR does tabletop RPG news and
recorded play sessions (pretty good), but mixed in with the rest of
their episodes is this irregular series. Two of the members of the usual
team are designing their own RPG’s and these podcasts detail their
travails as they go (or “failing in realtime, so you don’t have to” as
they say). The series has been going for a while (10 episodes over 2.5
years) and demonstrates certain invariants of game design - prototyping,
play-testing, iteration. It also makes me glad I’m not an tabletop RPG
designer (computer game devs have it easy)! The presenters are
entertaining and the content illuminating. Worth a listen.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.kenandrobintalkaboutstuff.com">Ken &amp; Robin Talk About
Stuff</a></em> is Ken Hite &amp; Robin
Laws talking on various topics. They are both tabletop RPG designers
with many successful games behind them. Both are excellent and
entertaining speakers regardless of the subject matter. Unsurprisingly
the podcast tends towards tabletop RPGs (how to play, game suggestions,
etc), but I’ve also heard them cover (each multiple times) history,
films, maps, politics, occult figures, even cooking. There is little
directly applicable to computer game design, but the density of ideas is
incredible. I’ve listened to over 100 episodes and always have an idea
for a cool game afterwards. A great podcast to fire the imagination.</p>
