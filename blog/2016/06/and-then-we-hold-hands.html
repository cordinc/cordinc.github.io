<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153999/and-then-we-held-hands">…and then, we held
hands</a>
is a very interesting two-player only, cooperative board game, available
for free print &amp; play (P&amp;P) download or purchase. Despite having an
abstract design it is incredibly thematic.</p>

<p>Originally developed in just 48 hours as part of the 2014 Global Game
Jam, this board game went on to win best Golden Geek Print &amp; Play and
earn a proper published release. However, the rules of the GGJ state
that all games must be released under Creative Commons, so it will
always be available for free download, as long as you are willing to
create the components yourself. This review is for the free P&amp;P
version.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The aim of the game is for both players to move into the centre of the
board (heart circle) in the same turn and in emotional balance. This is
done by reaching a number of intermediate emotional objectives (i.e.
board positions) by playing cards that match one of the four emotional
states depicted (happy, sad, calm and angry). Thus if the goal is to
reach a sad emotional position, and to get there requires passing
through happy and angry positions, then the player must play a happy,
angry then sad card in that order.</p>

<p>Card order is important as each card changes the players emotional
balance and they are not allowed to go too far in any direction. There
is also the bonus that after any move the player finishes balanced they
can refill their hand of cards. If they don’t have the required cards
for a move, then a player can use their partner’s cards too (but they
don’t refill if finishing balanced). So players have to work together to
meet their goals, sometimes using each other’s card, while at the same
staying balanced. Oh, and this should be done without communicating
strategy. Seriously, one of the game’s rules is that players should not
discuss the game, they can talk about other things but not
collaboration. Instead the players need to just anticipate their
partner.</p>

<p>From those simple rules comes an amazingly thematic game. So many
allegories. Some comments while playing included: “you go too fast and
suffer wild mood swings”; “I’m always ready to move to the next level
before you”; and, “sometimes we both need to be in sync”. I was deeply
impressed how well it captured the emotional give and take of a
relationship, while just moving around an abstract board! We played a
few times, but only won once, the other times we “broke up”. The victory
came with a little cheating on the collaboration rule. I suspect most
games would last about half an hour, at least getting close to the
endgame. Luck plays a reasonably sized role and the last bit is the most
difficult. The pieces are very pretty (with the professional version
looking even prettier). The only downside of the game is that the
P&amp;P rules are atrocious - they must have been written in a rush at
the end of the game jam. I strongly recommend downloading the rules from
the professional version (<a href="http://ludicreations.com/wp-content/uploads/gamerules/11%20ATWHH/ATWHH_rules_EN_compressed.pdf">rules
here</a>
and <a href="http://ludicreations.com/wp-content/uploads/gamerules/11%20ATWHH/ATWHH_FAQ_1.0_EN.pdf">faq
here</a>) - that is the only way we could work out how to play.</p>

<p>My partner described the game as “cute, but I prefer to talk [about
strategy]”. I think its an excellent idea, well executed and worth a
try.</p>
