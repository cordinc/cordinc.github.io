<p>When engaged in nuclear war, it is best to strike early and often. This
lesson brought to you by the stylish and disturbingly entertaining
<a href="https://www.introversion.co.uk/defcon/">DEFCON</a>, the tactical war game
where everybody dies in nuclear fire.</p>

<p>Many years ago, before the collapse of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union">USSR</a>, people were deathly
scared that the world would end in a nuclear war. I just remember that
time. There were movies like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarGames">WarGames</a> to play into that
fear (if you haven’t seen that movie, it is great, although dated now).
DEFON reminds me so much of the tactical screens in WarGames, it must be
intentional. The game is played on an abstract 2D wireframe map of the
world. Units are displayed by icons, missiles trail little dotted tracks
behind them. Impact zones are shown as white smudges. In a nice update
from WarGames, there are various overlays that colour the screen to show
player control, radar coverage or remaining population (that last one
gets darker and darker as the game progresses). The music is ethereal.
This game is beautiful in a spare and disturbing manner.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/defcon/impact_full.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/defcon/impact.png" alt="Impact" title="Impact" /></a></p>

<p>Disturbing, because the game is about killing by the million. At the
start the player choses their geographic location (Australia is not an
option, why?) and positions their units: radar installations; missile
silos; airbases; and, naval fleets. Then the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEFCON">DEFCON</a> counter slowly drops from
5 to 1 over a couple of hours of game time (which can be accelerated or
slowed down). As this level drops more actions become available - at
DEFCON 3 you can attack with conventional weapons, at DEFCON 1 nukes can
be launched. In realtime the player chooses the military actions to
perform with their units. Many of the possibilities are mutually
exclusive, for instance silos can either launch ICBMs at designated
targets, or can be in air-defence mode trying to shoot down inbound
missiles/bombers. At a set point in time the game ends and is scored by
how many people you killed and how many of your own people died.</p>

<p>There is no question in this game as to why this is happening. There is
no building new units or researching technology. The units you have at
the start are all you will ever have. It is just about dealing with the
immediate (short) war, by destroying as much as possible. The gameplay
is largely abstract, so players can ignore the underlying events until
missiles strike with messages like “New York hit, 11.0 million dead”.
Then it hits how dark this game is really. There never seems quite
enough to achieve a complete victory. First-strike, or defend first then
second-strike against depleted defences - neither seemed to work to well
at saving lives. As the tagline states: everybody dies.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/defcon/inbound_full.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/defcon/inbound.png" alt="Second strike" title="Second strike" /></a></p>

<p>There is replayability in DEFCON through various game modes and scoring
systems (such as all players starting on the same team and then
betraying each other, or speed games or games where you only score
points for killing and not saving people, and more). There is an
adequate AI, but the real action is in online play. Unfortunately as a
10 year old game, the DEFCON community still exists, but is somewhat
limited. There were 20-40 people playing at any time, but only a few
open slots. It is probably best to bring your own friends.</p>

<p>This is a good game, well implemented. I’m not sure what nuclear war
would look for those running it, but this feels like an excellent
approximation, even including a sickly cough way down in the audio mix.
Plus, it’s fun and challenging. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>DEFCON is US$9.99 on the Steam
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/1520/">store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.
It has been bundled.</p>
