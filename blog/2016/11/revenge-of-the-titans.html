<p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p><a href="http://www.puppygames.net/revenge-of-the-titans/">Revenge of the
Titans</a> is an
amuse-bouche for the strategy gamer. However, it is still an
entertaining, simple cross-over between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower
defense</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">RTS</a> game. Althought
it could perhaps benefit from a little more polish and guidance for the
beginning player.</p>

<p>In Revenge of the Titans the player is the commander of Earth forces as
they defend against attacks by the Titans - fast and huge aliens from
the eponymous moon of Saturn. The gameplay consists of placing various
defensive installations around a small map to fend of the waves of
titans that assault the main base. Units consist of the usual items such
as production facilities, mines, many types of gun turret, droid
factories and more. Each cost money, some of which is provided at the
start of the mission, but the rest must be produced by placing
refineries near map resources.</p>

<p>Enemies come in swarms from known positions and head towards your base
or other buildings which they may destroy. There is a diverse range of
enemies, some small and fast, some huge and heavily armoured. Your
defenses must be ready for everything. Defenses can be updated as the
mission unfolds and this is absolutely necessary in the games I played.
There are also various powerups that appear on the map for a short
period of time. Normally these just provide money, but sometimes they
allow one-off events like freezing all enemies or repairing all
buildings. Unfortunately, these powerups are often overlooked in the
mayhem of a scenario (or at least I missed them).</p>

<p>Sounds like a standard tower defense game? Not quite. The enemies can
move anywhere they like across the map. Attempts to channel them into
killing zones normally failed as they happily chomped their way through
my apparently flimsy barricades and carried on their destructive path.
When playing this game it feels similar to a RTS where the player only
ever defends. The view was jumping back and forth (sadly there is no
zoom functionality) as I reacted to events by placing ever more
installations. Planning quickly went out the window. Good reaction speed
and a clear view of battlefield actions can definitely help.</p>

<p>I quite like this mix of genres - it is not clearly in either camp, but
combines some nice parts of both. Plans were quickly created and then
fell apart even more quickly. There is no pause function to let players
catch their breath, they just have to deal with the onslaught - luckily
games only last 5-10 minutes. A new enemy type is added after every
successful mission, and the map changes too. There is a tech tree/matrix
for upgrading your installations or allowing new ones.</p>

<p>The negatives of this game are largely to do with polish. It was
released many years ago when players were a little more forgiving
towards Indie games and ready to spend the effort to work out the rules
by themselves. To enjoy this game you will need some patience. There are
no tooltips on the various installations to tell you what they do. The
various buttons are also quite small, often I have clicked on the wrong
one. Similarly the tech matrix can be intimidating at first, and there
is little guidance as what is required. It is easy to go down the wrong
path and make your forces ineffective against the enemy on higher
levels. Similarly the lack of a zoom is incredibly annoying. Many times
I missed a whole battlefront as I wasn’t aware it was happening until
warnings about my base flashed up.</p>

<p>This is a good game, but it could have been a great game with a little
more guidance (for newer players at least) and work on the gameplay
experience. Still it is worth a play to try the interesting mix of
genres and to save the world with the aid of a strong coffee!</p>

<p>Revenge of the Titans is available on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/93200/">Steam</a> and other online
stores for PC, Mac and Linux at $US9.99. It has been bundled many times.</p>
