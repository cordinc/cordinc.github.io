<br/><br/>
<p>After Java developers became surplus to requirements at the <a href="/blog/2014/10/prs.html">MCPS-PRS
Alliance</a> I had to suddenly hunt around for work
again. The PRS people were very nice to me and had no problems with me
looking for new jobs while at work. With almost year of working in
London behind me, it was surprisingly easy to get interviews. Rather
than the months of waiting previously experienced, a number of positions
came through agents quite quickly. The best of these was at <a href="http://www.rbs.co.uk">Royal Bank
of Scotland</a> (RBS), in their corporate and retail
banking operations (very separate and distinct from their investment
banking operations).</p>

<p>So I began a 3 month contract as a Team Leader on the Service Charge
Review System (SCRS) just as it started. The project had a 12 month
timeline, so if things went well I expected to hang around for further
contracts. SCRS was driven by the corporate relationship managers. These
are the people who dealt with businesses, big and small. Unlike retail
customers (normal people going to bank branches), businesses and
corporations paid a raft of fees for the services they use (thus service
charges). While there are a set of “standard” fees that businesses pay
by default, in reality all the fees are negotiable. The bigger the
business, the more negotiable the fees they pay. There are a large
number of possible fees, from receiving a cheque, running a credit card
or having an overdraft. Perhaps a medium-sized consumer firm has a need
for large amount of cash-handling (cash passed to a branch has to be
secured, counted and transported), but rarely makes international
transfers. It might look for the cash fees to be lowered in return for
higher international fees. Part of a relationship managers’ job is to
work out if that is a change the bank is willing to make, and if so
arrange it. The relationship managers also create speculative fee
structures to tempt business to shift banks.</p>

<p>At the time I joined RBS in May 2003, this process was performed on a
spreadsheet in an ad-hoc process. Creating a moderately complex fee
structure could take over a day and was both error-prone and hard to
modify later. This was seen as a bottleneck for expansion. The plan was
to create a simple internal website that could import data on current
fee structures/usage/profit, allow the quick creation of fee scenarios
(often from common base templates), and then save them centrally for
future use as templates or new relationship managers (as at the time,
people leaving meant all their scenarios were lost). The goal was that a
half dozen scenarios for a moderately complex business could be created
in a morning, and then easily adjusted based on customer interaction.
Based on my consulting experience I didn’t think this was a particularly
ambitious objective. It was a matter of loading data, performing some
simple calculations, displaying the results on a screen and allowing
editing, then saving it again afterwards. There would only be a few
hundred users, each of would be trained to use the system, and no one
expected it to look pretty. A reasonably straightforward job.</p>

<p>The first task was to recruit the programming team which I would manage.
There was the project manager (who hired me), an analyst, a database
person and a junior Java developer already on board. However there was
budget for two more Java programmers, but they had to be internal hires.
At that time RBS was just in the process of shifting from using mainly
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> to Java for its internal
development. Hence all the other developers had only a couple of years
of Java work total amongst them, and I was expected to mentor them
through the project. Internal hires also worked on the basis that HR
would send me a single CV for each position, and I could reject it and
ask for another, but it was frowned upon. The project manager strongly
suggested that I accept whomever was sent unless there was a serious
issue. In the end it didn’t matter. Both the suggested developers were
fine.</p>

<p>Along with the traditionally COBOL environment came a waterfall process.
Luckily, my manager was an <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/04/up-managers-and-down-managers.html">up
manager</a>
and was not greatly concerned about how the project was actually
developed as long as he knew what was happening and it all progressed
nicely. So SCRS was developed iteratively inside our small dev team,
before being handed off (in a waterfall-like manner) to the separate
deployment and support teams. It also helped that SCRS was a small
project among giants in the corporate IT section. A couple of large 50+
developer projects (one on a unified document system, the other I don’t
remember) had started around the same time as SCRS and were sucking up
developers and managerial attention. We were largely ignored and left to
our own devices. We started fortnightly iterations and developed a
prototype which got a couple of the relationship managers involved on a
part-time basis giving feedback. They were generally happy we were doing
as they requested. At the end of each iteration we had a working (but
incomplete) system that could be checked. Progress was steady, my team
was capable and learning fast enough. Confidence was high. Everything
was fine.</p>

<p>RBS was the start of my contracting career in London. From that point
until now, I have not been a permanent employee. IT contracting may have
a bad reputation in some countries, but not in London. It is common
among more experienced developers who do not wish to become managers.
There is a large community of contractors, many support services, pay
rates are high and jobs plentiful. It is assumed that in downturns,
contractors are dismissed first, but in my experience pay rates just
decrease instead. I started as a contractor by chance; the RBS job was
specifically a contract, so that is what I did. My agent suggested an
accountant and off I went. Unfortunately, my inexperience caused
problems. The accounting firm was borderline incompetent. I sacked them
after a couple of years when I learnt enough to do their job. They also
suggested a financial advisor who only promoted schemes that involved
huge kickbacks to himself. Hmmm, I managed to avoid all of them. Also
the agent set up the RBS contract in such a way I got caught by IR35,
and stayed that way for the next 5 years.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR35">IR35</a> is the UK tax law that
determines whether a contractor is considered a “disguised” employee.
Most contracts are written to avoid falling foul of this law, saving the
contractor 5-10% on their tax bill. Market contract pay rates take this
into account.</p>

<p>While at RBS, I was still considering becoming a manager. So I let it be
known I would consider going permanent if the circumstances were right.
As a result I got pulled into an HR meeting to discuss becoming a
permanent employee. However, I left determined to stay a contractor - at
least while at RBS. They explained to me the career progression and
where I would fit in. Basically, they expected me to take a step down
from my current team leadership position to become a straight developer,
although I would still have the same duties temporarily. I would also
earn about 40% less even after all the little benefits were added in.
Plus I would become subject to all the normal HR forms and reviews. It
seemed like a derisory offer. So I stayed a contractor and never looked
back. The longer I stayed at RBS the clearer the correctness of this
decision became. Just being able to avoid the bureaucracy of a large
company turned out to be a surprising benefit and something of which my
teammates became immensely jealous. Also there was little job security
at RBS for the permanents. There was a common greeting among RBS IT
people, “how many purges have you survived?”. Every few years a large
number of people were made redundant. Morale was not high.</p>

<p>RBS corporate and retail IT was (and probably still is) an incredibly
bureaucratic organisation. There were so many rules and forms to fill in
for any occasion. Budget was sacrosanct. Here are a couple of stories to
illustrate this. When I first arrived I didn’t have a computer setup
properly and I didn’t have the permissions to do it myself. Luckily
there was a sysadmin just one row over setting up about 100 PCs just
like mine for another project that would be turning up a week later.
Each took a few minutes, so I asked if he could do mine and he replied
no. It required a form and budget. For a few minutes work? Doing the
form would mean waiting a week that RBS would be paying me to do
nothing. But still he refused. So I waited until he went to lunch, and
added my PC to his pile. The next day I went and collected my PC from
the pile and got to work.</p>

<p>Another time I was discussing how much database space we required on
SCRS with a db admin (not the db developer). We estimated just a couple
of GBs and the admin told us we could have it in a few months, after the
budget was confirmed. What, why so long? I offered to give him a few
pounds from my pocket as the cost of that much space at a high-street
computer store. He laughed and told me how much it would cost at RBS.
Many hundreds of pounds, per GB, per year. Huh? It turns out the cost
was for the overstaffed (as he admitted) db admin team to justify their
existence by forcing captive clients (we couldn’t get the space
elsewhere) to pay their budget.</p>

<p>About 6 months in, we hit a couple of problems. This point was actually
near the end of the development process. Creating the system was
scheduled to take 9 months, with three months deployment, handover,
training and support from the dev team, before our part was complete.
The first issue was us Java developers racing ahead of the database
developer interfacing with the backend systems. We were constantly told
that it would be done soon. We agreed interfaces and wrote a mock
database so we could continue work. However, the lack of the actual
system and associated integration risks were now the top issue on weekly
status reports. It was always coming “soon”. Then the database coder
just disappeared for a few days. Then they returned and were clearly
drunk at their desk every morning. In retrospect, at this point we
should have cut them and rushed to get someone else. However, there was
some sympathy for them (there were a number of known personal issues),
so it was referred to HR and we tried to keep going. Involving HR had no
noticeable effect. A few weeks later there was still no database
backend, the dev was still drunk at their desk every day, and the rest
of the team became blocked waiting on them. Now they had to go. We got
an emergency replacement. The new database developer said there was
nearly nothing to show for months work, but got to work and pulled some
overtime to get everything up and running in just a couple of weeks. To
our benefit, by this stage we Java programmers knew exactly what we
wanted from the database and had the time to help the new guy get it all
running perfectly for us. Although this process lost us about a month
off the critical path on our schedule. Still we had built up a little
slack beforehand, plus the 3 month slowdown to finish the project could
include more development. So it was ok, final handover could still occur
on time.</p>

<p>Soon after integrating the database the second problem hit. We presented
the a near complete version of SCRS to our customers. They were happy,
as they had seen it before on their weekly visits to our office. They
took it away to try it in a production setting and show some other
relationship managers. A few days later they came back and stated that
there was a problem. They need it to be greatly changed. The changes
were significant, but not difficult, just time consuming. A month of
work at least, probably two. Considering the time lost with the
database, there was no way we could make the changes and complete on
schedule. More importantly from the RBS management process, our budget
would be bust. We asked “why do you need these changes, you saw it being
written and were happy with it?” They said we had absolutely delivered
what they asked for and wanted. However, over the last few days they
realised it was not what they needed. Urgh. They played hardball and
threatened to refuse sign off, apparently this was a big deal in the RBS
IT organisation, and would reflect very badly on the development team.
Our manager countered that we had no money to continue.</p>

<p>After a couple of days an agreement was reached. The relationship
managers accepted that the requested changes were new work and not the
result of any mistake on our end. Thus they agreed to pay the budget
overrun out of their own money. Although not all of us. The dev team
would shrink to me and one other Java person for 3 months and one other
programmer for half that time. Everyone else would move to other
projects. Our manager also got the two relationship managers acting as
our customers to sit with us full-time (they would still do their normal
work, but from our offices and ready to answer our questions as
required). This last point was immensely useful, and probably the reason
everything got done to the new schedule. It also meant that news of the
project began to spread among both the IT department and the corporate
banking department. The relationship managers were very happy with the
work being done and the progress on their “extra requirements”. As
friendly and talkative people they started telling everyone around them
about it. It was like having a marketing department for an internal
project.</p>

<p>It didn’t take long before we had early builds going out again to the
test users, and the responses were extremely positive (much more so than
the first build). It seemed the extra requests really did make a big
difference. Thus as the original 12 months expired and we started our
handover process, something strange occurred. Managers started appearing
and asking to be involved in the project. It seems the two large
concurrent IT projects were in trouble and experiencing large delays and
cost overruns. By comparison SCRS was looking like a massive success.
Cost overruns were tracking towards 20-30%, but covered by the client
business unit which was effusively praising the final product. One
manager offered to write us a piece in the company magazine. Not sure
why he thought we couldn’t do that ourselves? Still the project manager
went from being ignored, to fielding daily requests to help out or
people offering “advice”. One positive is that when it came time for the
team members to find new projects they all got their preferred choice.</p>

<p>Soon it was time for the end. We trained the support person. I flew up
to Edinburgh to help deploy and troubleshoot the final installation.
Unsurprisingly there were issues at this stage as we had not been allows
to test this process before. I spent my two days in Scotland sitting in
a office basement getting it all working fine. I can’t have seen more
than a few minutes of sunshine during the entire visit. Then back via
the RBS trough, aka the Edinburgh Airport British Airways business
lounge (full of RBS employees grabbing as much food and alcohol as they
could manage). When I got back I had a week of just waiting by myself
(and the project manager) in case there were any problems. Everyone else
had moved on. In fact the project manager had arranged for me to join
another project too (more about that in <a href="/blog/2016/09/rbs-2.html">Part
2</a>), to ensure I was around just in case of
any problems. In the end it wasn’t required, no one was ever called back
to work on the SCRS. Instead during those last days we got fan mail.
Seriously, at least three relationship managers sent us emails saying
how much easier SCRS had made their jobs. It was amazing.</p>

<p>A year later, just after leaving RBS, I met the SCRS support guy at
another person’s leaving do. I asked how it was going. He told me SCRS
was the easiest system he had ever supported. In the more than a year
since going live there had not been a single bug reported. The SCRS work
was a few minutes every week setting up new users and running a backup.
A system being used for a year, meeting all its customer’s requirements,
without bugs. SCRS is probably the most successful project I have ever
been involved with (apart from profitability, but that is a story for a
later post). So that should be the end, right? Unfortunately not, there
is one sad addendum.</p>

<p>Just after talking to the SCRS support person, I met and spoke to the
SCRS project manager at the same leaving party. It turned out that on
his performance review SCRS was classed as a failed project. I was
aghast. I told him about the support person saying there were no bugs.
He replied that didn’t matter. The project was overtime and budget. I
pointed out that the client covered the budget overrun and the extra
time was due to their extra requests. He said that the customer had no
input to the project assessment process. Lastly, I pointed out that no
other project in the building could be considered a success either by
those measures. He agreed, but then told me that the two big concurrent
projects were considered successes internally despite being relatively
further over time and budget. The difference being that they both had
more political clout behind them. Not all projects could be marked as
successful, some had to fail according to the internal review system. IT
projects were assessed on a curve relative to their peers. SCRS, with no
important friends, was the designated failure. I told my ex-manager that
his work and support was a core reason for SCRS’s obvious success by all
reasonable measures - that didn’t make him any happier. Never have I
been so relieved to have left an employer.</p>
