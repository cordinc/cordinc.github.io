<p>I have regularly produced posts on <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/tag/Podcasts.html">history
podcasts</a> for this blog.
However, the vast majority of my podcast consumption is not focussed on
history. Instead my iPod is full of music and gaming podcasts. I won’t
review the music podcasts, but I do write about
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/tag/Games.html">gaming</a> occasionally, so I
thought it may be worth giving my brief thoughts on gaming podcasts.
Here is part 1: my opinion on 4 gaming podcasts. While the next part
will detail 4 game design podcasts.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/3ma/">Three Moves Ahead</a></em> is a long
running podcast focusing predominately on strategy and tactical games. I
am a huge fan of such games, and this is my favourite source for
deciding whether a game might be something I should consider buying.
Episodes are a well produced freeform discussion between a group of game
journalists (often hosted by Rob Zacny). Most episodes are an incredibly
detailed deep dive into the gameplay and mechanics of a single computer
game (or occasionally, a board game). So detailed is the examination
that I considered also including this podcast in the game design post.
The games chosen are also not always the big current releases, they also
look at old classics, and once a month a title chosen by their listeners
(by vote). Excellent podcast and a must-listen for anyone remotely
interested in strategy/tactical games (as a player or creator).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://5by5.tv/dlc">DLC</a></em> is the latest gaming show from Jeff
Cannata, previously from the discontinued
<a href="http://revision3.com/trs">TRS</a> and NLB (what is with the 3 letter
acronyms?). Here he joins comedian Christian Spicer and a weekly guest
(journalist, developer or sometimes just a friend) in a structured
discussion on current gaming news. Each episode follows a familiar
progression: first is News of the Week, where the latest game news is
discussed; then Playlist, talking about the games the participants
played this week; and finally Tabletop Time, looking at board games
(although this last section often feels like an afterthought, becoming a
Jeff Cannata monologue). I find this podcast the best source of gaming
news (despite it being up a week old) as the subsequent discussion is
usually quite enlightening and contains reasonable (unlike Internet
commenters!) and differing points of view. This show is also the most
professional podcast in this list and it shows - it is a high quality
production and both presenters are good speakers (no talking over each
other here), but it also contains a couple of minutes of advertising
(not much of a problem in a 90 minute show). While the News section is a
weekly must-listen, and the Playlist an interesting discussion of
current games, I usually find myself skipping Tabletop time.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://crateandcrowbar.com">Crate &amp; Crowbar</a></em> is a revolving group UK
game journalists having a chat about what they are playing while
drinking (alcohol), and sometimes a bit of bit news &amp; listener
questions. This is the only podcast where all the participants are
actually physically together in person, and can sometimes feel like
eavesdropping on a friendly work chat between knowledgeable gamers, with
a side competition in who can provide the most humorous quip. It tends
to require some knowledge of current games, and listeners should expect
some serious and often intellectual discussion on the nature of game
design and the role of games in culture (I never heard a gaming podcast
mention <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ludonarrative+dissonance">Ludonarrative
dissonance</a>
in their reviews before). There are also often entertaining stories on
notable moments in games (cool, or disappointing). They generally play
what ever is new that week in any genre, and if its something that
doesn’t interest me I’ll just fast forward a bit. They also answer
listener questions at the end and this can be a real highlight (who asks
these questions? other intellectual game journalists?).</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.spacegamejunkie.com/category/podcasts/">SpaceGameJunkie</a></em>
has only been on my listening list for a few weeks, but it is sounding
good so far. This podcasts differs from the other as it is the only one
made by fans rather than industry insiders (as far as I can tell).
Sometime this results in questionable production quality, but also with
what appears to be real interest for the games being discussed. As the
title suggests this podcasts focussed exclusively on space games
(although there seems to be a wide definition of that genre). The format
is a discussion about a single game between two gaming fans and one or
two people from the development team. There is usually an accompanying
YouTube video of the game being played. The chat is always friendly, but
unfortunately the devs often sound like PR people. The games covered are
often small and not well known. Sometimes they are in an early stage of
development and the podcast becomes a design session. The strong
impression is it is just a few people who want to talk about their games
and help promote them. A laudable goal and the result is worth a listen.</p>
