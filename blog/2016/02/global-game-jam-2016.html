<p>Another year, another massive Global Game Jam. This year <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/news/so-long-ggj16-and-thanks-all-fun">over 36000
people</a>
took part world wide. At the IGDA Kuala Lumpur site in Malaysia <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/igda-malaysia-game-jam">150
jammers completed 31
games</a>
(plus there were a few more uncompleted games and a whole <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/jam-sites/my-game-jam!">other local
jam site</a>). The
event has grown hugely in popularity over the years I’ve attended. At
the <a href="/blog/2013/01/ggj13-in-kl.html">2013 KL GGJ</a> there were only 5
small teams. For the second year in a row, the random team I joined
managed to produce a complete game - the 2-player tile-placement game
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/hex-cute">Hex-a-cute</a>.</p>

<p>Knowing the traditional late start, I arrived at the jam site on the
Glenmarie campus of <a href="http://www.kdu.edu.my">KDU</a> just after 9pm (to
avoid traffic). This seemed about right, individual jammers had just
started brainstorming ideas around the theme “ritual”. Although the
majority of people had come as part of a pre-formed team and thus were
receiving their site-enforced difficulty modifier. All pre-formed teams
had to obtain 3 game names from a <a href="http://www.videogamena.me">random name
generator</a> (in public, so no cheating) and
then base their game on both the theme and one of the generated names.
If you wonder what strange cultural mindset results in a jam site full
of games like “Alcoholic Bong in the Salad Kingdom”, “Communist Yeti
Girl”, and “Sensual Gnome in the Middle East” - now you know, they were
all from pre-formed teams with random names.</p>

<p>People without a pre-formed team all pitched their idea to the 40 or so
remaining individuals and then there was a vote on which ideas would
become games. A poll of the group determined that artists were the least
well represented skill set (surprising as there are usually less
programmers). The site organisers decreed 7 ideas would progress to
development as that meant 2 artists per team. I was quite impressed by
the pitches this year. Although most involved the ritual of monster
summoning (as did mine), the majority seemed realistic in scope (unlike
previous years). It seems that repeat participants are learning from the
problems of previous years, and sharing that knowledge.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj16/voting.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj16/voting_thumb.png" title="Votes on the pitched ideas" width="550" alt="Votes on the pitched ideas" /></a></p>

<p>For the first time there were also jammers in KL who had participated
previously at other sites (a couple travelling from Germany) - so we
could compare and contrast. Apparently pre-formed teams are common
around the world (despite being against the spirit of the event, as I
understand it), but the handicaps imposed on such teams in KL are not
often repeated. Nor is the pitching system used in KL a regular
occurrence (does anyone else do this?). Many jam sites have awards and
run competitions, but not in KL (to make the event more collaborative).
Also apparently at most sites jammers form teams and start very soon
after the theme is announced at 5pm. At the KL jam pre-formed teams may
start straight after the theme, but everyone else is lucky to get
started by midnight (so such teams complete their games in closer to 40
hours).</p>

<p>Voting finished around midnight and the teams formed. I joined a team
working on a monster-summoning tile-placement game with two other
coders, an artist and two designers. We quickly decided to simplify the
original idea from matching tiles with lines on them to matching flat
colours. Also we changed the theme from “cultists summoning
”Cthulhu“:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu” to something related to
indigenous peoples (although that got further confused with the monsters
and it was never certain if it was about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orang_Asli">Orang
Asli</a> or another culture - it
ended up just a vague indigenous reference). With the basic design laid
out we all got to work.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj16/team.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj16/team_thumb.png" title="The Hex-a-cute team" width="550" alt="The Hex-a-cute team" /></a></p>

<p>I can strongly recommend to all neophyte jammers that they aim low and
then try to build up (also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSsR419HBpQ">bring a
towel!</a>). Especially in
randomly formed teams, you will have little idea of how much can be
achieved until work has already begun. It is far more motivating over
the last few hours to be iterating and improving on a complete game than
struggling just to get something working. Our team took this advice and
by Saturday evening we played the first complete game. It was not what
we expected. We could see various strategies emerging in gameplay, but
over the course of a 40 minute game, rather more than the quick casual
experience we were targeting. Luckily we had time. After a few hours of
discussion on our goals, we worked in many tweaks to speed gameplay.
There was also time to work on the GUI and someone had the excellent
idea to put the basic rules next to the play area. By the finish the
game worked well (although still not really “casual”), looked great and
was something we all felt proudly about.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj16/pizza.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj16/pizza_thumb.png" title="KL Pizza Party" width="550" alt="KL Pizza Party" /></a></p>

<p>The jam finished with the now traditional KL pizza party. Everyone came
together to talk games and design - a great friendly occasion. Then came
the final game presentations. There was an impressive set of games this
year, most of which seemed playable (or at least they were carefully
demo’ed to suggest they were playable). Many were humorous (probably
enforced by the random name generator). A couple were absolutely
beautiful - local skill and tools are clearly improving. One complete
playable game worth a look (other than ours of course!) is <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2016/games/night-unicycle-quickening">Night of the
Unicycle - The
Quickening</a>,
a fast paced game of duelling unicorn unicyclists (well done, random
name generator!).</p>

<p>Thanks to all the other participants and organisers - well done to
everyone. You helped make an enjoyable 48 hours.</p>

<p>One last postscript, as I think this a funny photo. The location for
this year’s jam changed to the larger Glenmarie KDU campus. Absolutely
necessary to fit all the numerous jammers this year. The site was mostly
excellent - brand new and very well-equipped, they even provided some
PCs for jammers to use! Although there was one little downside. The
onsite shower facilities are shown in the photo below.</p>
