<p>Is it bad to find slaughtering orcs fun? I hope so considering the name
of this fun Tower Defense/Third Person Shooter hybrid is <a href="https://orcsmustdie.com/">Orcs Must
Die</a> (and it lives up to the name!).</p>

    <p><em>“Over and over and over and over and over<br /><br />
Like a monkey with a miniature cymbal<br /><br />
The joy of repetition really is in you”</em><br /><br />
Hot Chip - Over and Over</p>

<p>This years goals are <a href="/blog/2016/01/goals-5.html">the same as last
year</a>.</p>

<p>Wait, no, they are not! Last year one of my goals was to complete
<a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">Concealed Intent</a> and release it. Done</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>it is out (since August) on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150">Steam</a> and
<a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/store/concealed-intent">Humble</a>. There has
even been a 1.1 update. Finishing Concealed Intent has been a constant
target going back over four years. Now the goals will need to be ever so
slightly different…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Create and release a game.</strong> This new wording on the game
development objective is something that can be endlessly repeated.
One of the main learnings from Concealed Intent is the realistic
scope of any game I can make by myself. I intend to use this
knowledge to make smaller games - ones that can be started and
finished within a year. Or even less if possible!</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog on my websites at least 4 times a month</strong> Last year this goal
stated the posts should be on my personal website - a target missed
with just 18 entries there in 2016. However, during the year I
started a new blog, <a href="http://www.agamedevplays.com">A Gamedev Plays…</a>
(and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">associated YouTube
channel</a>).
Combined those two websites met the target easily - so I consider
that a success. This year I will not not be restricted to any
website (so this goal now also includes the <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">Jarrah Technology
website</a>).</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><strong>Exercise.</strong> With regular weights and running, I am just below the
peak strength achieved in mid-2015, and can now run faster than ever
before for 30 minutes without joint pain. Not bad. Especially on the
running side - I hope the old injuries are definitely in the past.
The more specific goals for the year are to again start lifting
personal bests and run without pain for an hour at my current 30min
pace.</li>
</ul>

<p>So far, so similar, but now time for something new.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Learn Spanish</strong> Around mid-year I started spending 10 minutes/day
online attempting to learn Spanish as there was I chance I would end
up living in a Spanish speaking country. That is now very unlikely
to occur, but I have kept up the lessons. According to the websites
I use, my vocabulary is around 1000 words (and my pronunciation is
awful). Now I’m beginning to learn grammar (the first time in any
language!). It seems a shame to stop now, so this goal is just to
maintain regular lessons and see how it goes.</li>
</ul>

<p>And that is it. Although there is one more thing to be said. In the
middle of this year I will be moving country. At the moment it is still
not certain where I will end up (although London or Australia are by far
the most likely). Previous experience of trans-continental moves show
they can be incredible destructive to productivity. Thus, there is a
good chance my plans will collapse under this event. It is also likely I
will need to find a normal desk job in the second half of the year.
Given this, I will be easy on myself if at the end of the year, I fall a
little short on the goals above.</p>

<p>Yes, no, yes, no - how hard can it be to run a fantasy kingdom? Very
hard, and also quite fun in the simple and innovative

    <p>Just over a year ago the small casual gaming group I play in started the
board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1">Pandemic Legacy Season

Just under a month ago, after nine game sessions, we finished. This is a
