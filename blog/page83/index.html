    <p>I run a couple of Rails websites

have a great deal of computing resources available to support two

will know that the first page view can take seemingly ages, but that
after that it speeds up. As I use <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Phusion Passenger

I investigated some of the config options and how they affected

    <p>Urgh, overconfidence is a killer. I have now completed the 50 online $2+0.20 heads-up tournaments I <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/11/how-to-make-1hour-playing-onli.html">previously
mentioned</a>.
You may remember my goal was to win 70. Well, I didn’t make it. The good
news is I won more than I lost - 52. The bad news is that with entrance
fees, a win rate of 55% is required to break even. I lost $6 and so
ended up with $66; a little disappointing.</p>

<p>It all started so badly. I’d like to think it was just variance - that
the luck of the cards means that sometimes you are just going to lose.
However, reading that goal-setting blog post and remembering those first
few games, I think I might have been overconfident. I improved a little
over time. If I played the first 25 like the second 25, then I would
have made a small profit, but still a long way from the 70% goal.</p>

<p>Like my first posting, I think the main problem is my attitude. While
playing this 50 I kept a record of whether I considered I played “well”
or “badly”, together with the final result. My definition of playing
badly included: not starting in an appropriate frame of mind; getting
disheartened during the match; chasing pots; or bluffing too much even
when the other player was betting back. Those are my main vices. Just
today I played a match where after I ground the other player down for 10
minutes, I went all in on the turn with a full house and then lost on a
2-outer as they made a slightly better full house on the river! Despite
still having a playable stack (around 30BB), I was tilted and busted
stupidly a few hands later. That was badly played. Playing well meant I
played mostly calmly the entire match, allowing a few small bad hands as
long as they were non-terminal. Notably, the maths of poker did not
count for much in categorisation. If both players went all in pre-flop
after just a few hands (a surprisingly common experience), then it was
considered well played if I was ahead at the start (the normal
situation). One game defied categorisation as the other player
disappeared after 2 hands and had to be blinded out. Thus there were 49
entries.</p>

<p>I played well 59% of the time. When playing well I won 72% of the time.
When playing badly I won only 20% of the time. Even allowing a bias
towards saying I played well if I won and badly if I lost, that is still
a big difference. Playing badly 40% of the time is way too high. If I
played well every match, as I should, then I would be close to my
original goal. So the goal for the next 50 is to win 30 (60), by playing
well 80 of the time. To that end, here is my beginner’s advice (from a
beginner to a beginner), which I will try to follow over the next 50:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decide before starting how many matches you want to play - many
times the “just one more” game was a bad loss.</li>
  <li>Only play if you want to win and can play for the 30 minutes or more
it can take.</li>
  <li>Don’t chase pots, especially if your opponent is betting back.</li>
  <li>Think about what your opponent has - remember 50% of the time they
have a better pre-flop hand.</li>
  <li>Start tight with small bets until you get an idea of your opponent.
If they are tight don’t bluff too much when they bet back (beware
even if they are loose and aggressive). However, be aware people’s
style changes with stack size.</li>
  <li>If you play a hand badly, don’t dwell on it, but do think about
these guidelines.</li>
  <li>If you lose badly, stop.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Yesterday was the 3rd Poker evening. It was held at Ian’s place and
seven people turned up: Me, Ann, Ian, Christian, Cristina, Pete and Ury.
We played three games and as has become usual, started by reducing
expectations on our ability. I didn’t take notes so my memories are a
little limited.</p>

<p>The first game was a standard £5 NLHE tournament, and I started in my
standard heads-up manner - aggressively. As people started betting small
amounts, I bluffed the first hand and then bet big on the turn in the
second with a flush draw, straight draw with two overcards. Then I
realised I was betting pot percentages, while others were making bets of
big blind. The game settled down a bit, but with the occasional big move
reminiscent of the first few hands. Pete went out first and rebought.
The numbers were steadily whittled down. Just after an hour Pete had a
run of great cards (at least the ones we saw) and knocked out the last
few people in quick succession. I was second.</p>

<p>For the second game we played with substantially smaller stacks to
accommodate Pete and Ury who had go in an hour. This seemed to make
everyone aggressive and as the blinds doubled when someone was knocked
out we were all quickly down to around 10 big blinds each. It seemed
like nearly every other hand someone was all-in. There was rarely an
obvious bluff - people just had good cards, often in fact the same good
cards (on at least 2 occasions the pot was split equally). I went all-in
against Ann on the first hand when there was a spade flush on the board - whoever had the higher spade would win. Knowing that Ann is quite a
cautious player, I thought I could scare her off the pot despite not
having a single spade. Ann knows I bluff so after an age of thinking,
called with her 9 of spades and I had to rebuy. The carnage continued
and Ian was out the next hand. Pete’s run of good cards continued at the
start, knocking out Cristina with KK vs QQ preflop. At the end Pete’s
luck ended and mine started with three great hands in a row to beat Pete
into second. The whole game lasted under 45 minutes - very quick.</p>

<p>Only Ian and I were available for the third game, everyone else had to
leave. Considering it was a heads up match, I don’t remember much other
than I finished my beers right at the start. I do recall that after
playing for a while I won a big all-in pot and thought I had crippled
Ian. Instead after matching chips we were equal with perhaps Ian
slightly ahead! Ian was grinding me down. I tried to tighten up, but it
didn’t work and I got annoyed at a couple of hands I definitely played
too weakly postflop. In the end I misread Ian’s body language thinking
he had nothing when infact he was trying to disguise having the nuts.
Ian won.</p>

    <p>I recently travelled to Tunisia for a holiday. Visiting the ancient
ruined Roman city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dougga">Dougga</a> was a
highlight. It is quite hard to reach as an independent traveller. First
you have to find the Tunis Northern Bus Station (out of the tourist
areas), go on a 2-hour bus journey to Teboursouk (the closest town),
from there you arrange a return taxi trip to the ruins. Once there
though, it is quite impressive. We had the place almost to ourselves for
a couple of hours - perhaps we should have arranged for a longer stay
with the taxi driver, but we had to catch the last bus back to Tunis!
Some of the best photos I took are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157611388103847/">here on
Flickr</a>.
In future I will put more photos up under that Flickr account.</p>

    <p>Now that I have a couple of sites up and running on the web, I thought
I’d talk about how I chose my hosting providers and how it’s going. For
those who just want the short version: I use
<a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> and am very happy with them. Read
on for more details.</p>

<p>When looking at potential hosts for my Rails web apps I took into
consideration price, speed/memory, reliability and flexibility. I
basically wanted something cheap, reliable and fast. I’ve been an
amateur sysadmin before (and at my first dotcom job was technically a
pro sysadmin), so I wasn’t scared of getting into the unix command line.
Thus support wasn’t important. Similarly for a small project, bandwidth,
email accounts and credit-card billing systems would not be used. I
wanted more than a hobbyist’s hosting site (even if that is exactly what
I am), but not costly, professional hosting.</p>

<p>My first thoughts were my domain name register,
<a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, or the host of this blog,
<a href="http://www.pair.com/">pair</a>. I know a number of people have issues with
GoDaddy, but I’ve always found them fine for buying domain names and I
can just ignore their constant upselling. However, I wasn’t sure about
their Rails hosting and a search only found bad stories (eg.
<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/godaddy_hosting_now_supports_rails.php">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/blog/2007/07/rails-on-godaddy.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.mcmoyer.com/2007/9/14/running-rails-on-godaddy-a-k-a-how-do-you-keep-a-geek-entertained">here</a>).
I’ve also been happy with the service Pair have provided with this blog
and associated static website. I didn’t find much online about their
Rails hosting and decided it would in any case be best to use different
providers for this blog and my Rails apps.</p>

<p>Next I took a look at some webpages specifically listing Rails web
hosts, such as on the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/RailsWebHosts">Rails
wiki</a>. Among the
massive listing there, special mention is made of
<a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a> and
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">EngineYard</a> on a couple of occasions.
Certainly, these two companies seem to be held in very high esteem in
the Rails community and host many well known Rails sites. However, they
are both quite expensive - aiming for the high-end market. Too expensive
for my goals or really anyone without funding. They are more
aspirational - it would be nice to one day need the services of such a
hosting firm.</p>

<p>I also found a couple of lists at
<a href="http://www.rubyonrailswebhost.com/">rubyonrailswebhost</a> and <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2006/01/01/rails-hosting/">Zen and
the Art of
Programming</a>. They
rate <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> and
<a href="http://www.site5.com/">Site5</a> highly and both hosts matched my needs:
dirt cheap (under $10/month) and with decent reliability according to
reviews. Before signing up I sent Antonio Cangiano at <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com">Zen and the Art
of Programming</a> (a decent Rails blog I now
subscribe to) an email asking if he had any updated advice since his
blog on hosting was nearly 2 years old. Antonio suggested a new name,
<a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a>. Slicehost use a virtualisation
system so that it appears to the hosted application that it has a whole
server to itself (albeit a fairly small server). This means that someone
else’s app can’t hog resources slowing down your app. With memory
intensive Rails apps this is very useful. They also have full command
line access - you basically start with a clean build and can
install/configure it how you like. While any “point and click” users
would find it daunting, this really appealed to me. They provide a
number of <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/">useful getting started
articles</a>, including some Rails ones, so
I was sold. They are more expensive than other hosts at $20/month for a
256MB, but I have been very happy with their service over the last 6
months.</p>
