    <p>This <a href="http://blog.ativiti.com/wheres-the-task-management-category-killer/">blog
article</a>
argues that current online todo list and project management tools don’t
meet people’s needs and are too complex. Judging by the comments of some
people at the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/10/london-hacker-meetup-6.html">London Hackers
Meetup</a>,
this is not an uncommon view. I agree too. This is why I’m trying to
steer a user-friendly middle-path between Queuesarus’ competitors - a
group it seems Ativiti intends to join (yeah, bring it on!).</p>

<p>So how is it going? Well the Beta testing suggests that the
functionality is nearly good enough, but that it is still not
user-friendly. I’m not sure what to do. While I knew some parts of the
system were difficult to understand, I had a plan for them. However,
there are problems with areas I thought were fine. As the blog says, it
is a hard problem and I haven’t seen it done well. More thought is
required, and advice is welcome.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last Thursday I went to the “London Hacker Meetup #6”. These events are
organised as a London analogue to the dinners held for <a href="http://ycombinator.com/&quot;">Y
Combinator</a> startups in the US, although
anyone could go along. Never having been to an Y Combinator dinner, I
can’t compare to the original, but I definitely found it an interesting
evening and more welcoming than the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/07/techcrunch-pitch.html">Techcrunch
Pitch</a> event.
It was held in the <a href="http://www.songkick.com">Songkick</a> offices in
Spitalfields (actually over the market) and drew a crowd of around 30,
mainly youngish guys in very casual clothing (there were I think 3
women). I felt quite old and conspicuous in my work shirt and trousers.
Luckily everyone was polite and friendly even after I told them I worked
at a bank.</p>

<p>There were four quick talks.
<a href="http://www.connectivelogic.co.uk/">ConnectiveLogic</a> demonstrated their
product to easily create concurrent programs without writing any
concurent code - interesting, but I’d have to have a play before saying
more. <a href="http://fuzzwich.com/">Fuzzwich</a> showed their online product to
easily create simple flash animations. It looked fun and having tried it
out since I can say it definitely works as advertised - give it a try.
Mary (can’t remember the rest of her name) spoke about her music
recommendation project, <a href="http://theperceptron.com/">The Perceptron</a>.
Finally, a guy presented his idea for a startup, then asked if anyone
was interested in joining him and applying to Y Combinator. I was
tempted, but thought it would be hard to commit to a company with
someone I didn’t know at all. Also, I’m more invested in
<a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queuesaurus</a> and would need a good offer to
move right now.</p>

<p>After the talks we decamped to the local pub. I spoke to a couple of the
Fuzzwich people for a while. They moved from San Francisico to London to
be near their customers. We discussed how to pay employers (not so
little they aren’t committed but not too much, they also said an options
“cliff” was standard - that is if you are sacked within the “cliff”
period, usually a year, then your options are cancelled). We also spoke
about motivation and starting a company, their advice was “do it!” They
seem like nice people. Later I spoke to a person who had an idea for a
startup; but not the technical knowhow to implement it. This seems like
a common problem, there seemed to be a few such people around. My last
conversation was with a guy I met at the Pitch event. He said that the
company that pitched had since shutdown - we talked a bit about founder
commitment and how important it is. He didn’t seem discouraged at all;
he is now interviewing other startups founders to see if they suit him
(definitely the right way round!).</p>

<p>I certainly left with the impression that there is still a great deal of
activity in the London startup scene, even as the financial IT world
significantly slows.</p>

    <p>It is done, or at least, the beginning is done. I have put the current
version of my program on the web, proceed directly to <a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queuesaurus
(www.queuesaurus.com)</a> and tame the work
beast! Please note, it should still be considered beta software.</p>

<p>So, what next? Well, I have a massive feature todo list for Queuesaurus
(soon to be transcribed to the web version of Queuesaurus in a valiant
attempt at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one%27s_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>) and
no doubt bugs will be discovered (if you find a bug or have a feature
request, add it to the “Queuesaurus Issues” queue). However, that is not
a proper answer to the question, I could keep improving Queuesaurus
nearly forever. Instead I need to know how far to pursue this or whether
to move onto other things.</p>

<p>During the last few months I have had numerous other project ideas, some
that could be a business and others that are little more than side
distractions. So far, only one has been pursued beyond thought (I’ll
blog about that later). A few times it has passed my mind to start
something new.</p>

<p>The original aims of Queuesaurus were to, at a minimum, keep working
until I had something usable and learn about setting up a web business.
I think I can just claim to have achieved the first goal, but not the
second. There is still a great deal to learn beyond the technical side.
I’m not going to leave my consulting contract just yet, nor am I ready
to advertise or properly release it, but I think it’s worth giving
Queuesaurus a bit of time to see how it goes. After that, who knows. I
also think I should head out to the occasional local tech event and get
the word out. The more people who try out Queuesaurus, the better it
will become and I’ll get a better idea of its potential.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Anyway give it a try!</a></p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A few people have asked me if I have given up on the project and startup
idea that was the original motivation for this blog. No, I have not. A
large rewrite and a lack of testing has slowed me down. There is a very
large list of new functionality and I could of course keep working on it
nearly forever before it is “finished”. However, my experience has
suggested it is best to release early and often after a minimum level
has been reached. My project has now reached that minimum level. There
is the occasional bug, new functionality to write and the GUI is still
awkward - but what needs to be done will be clearer with people
(hopefully) using it, or at least commenting on it.</p>

<p>So this would normally be where I put a link…</p>

<p>Unfortunately/fortunately, I am on holiday the next fortnight and to
announce it seems like tempting fate a little too much. Instead I will
just describe my idea, and in mid-September give the web address. I keep
a great number of todo lists around for work and most software
development workplaces have bug tracking or project management software.
It seems to me there is a middle ground between a simple online todo
list (of which there are many) and a complex project management system
(again, there are many of these). My goal is something that can be
easily used by one person or can handle groups of people working
together. Another goal is to make it easy to use for non-IT people as
long as they are familiar with the web (thus usable by a wider audience
than many of the issue tracking systems that focus on IT people). So
there’s the plan, soon you can compare theory to reality.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Back in May I decided it was time to learn to play golf. Since then I
have been to a golf school, 2 golf courses, a driving range and an
indoor video golf centre. I thought I would write briefly about them.</p>

<p><strong>The James Andrews School Of Golf</strong></p>

<p>I signed up for a 3 day residential training course with <a href="http://golfschool.co.uk/">The James
Andrews School Of Golf</a> as a holiday. I
greatly enjoyed the break. Although I can’t claim to be a good golfer at
the moment, I can say that I am a better golfer as a result of the
course as I saw my swing improve over the 3 days (considering I
consistently missed the ball entirely at the start). Indeed most of the
course focussed on the swing. The general format was swing practice,
putting/pitching practice, and then the swing again before lunch and
having the afternoon to ourselves. Nice course, good teacher, highly
recommended (although the food could have been better considering the
cost). I certainly left feeling prepared to tackle a proper course.</p>

<p><strong>World Of Golf</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately it took a while before I managed to get myself onto a
proper golf course, so in the interim I kept up my driving skills with a
couple of visits to <a href="http://www.worldofgolf-uk.co.uk/driving+ranges/sidcup">World Of
Golf</a>, a local
driving range. I never had to queue for a bay, itis £7 for 100 balls and
you can hire clubs, not much more to say. I still go regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Hobbs Cross Golf Course</strong></p>

<p>My first proper game of golf was at <a href="http://www.hobbscrossgolfcentre.com/">Hobbs
Cross</a>. in Essex. It seemed like a
friendly course, geared towards beginners. There was a 9-hole par-3 and
another more normal 9-hole. For the record I was 57-over for the full</p>
<ol>
  <li>There was a driving range, but the cafe was closed - take your own
food just in case. A good course and I’ll go back eventually (it’s a
good distance away from where I live).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Beckenham Place Park Golf Course</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.glendale-golf.com/course-7-beckenham-place.aspx">Beckenham Place
Park</a> is
probably the nearest course to my current abode. It is a cheap public
course (£50 for 2 and club hire), and is a bit harder than Hobbs Cross.
Aside from the golf, I was not greatly impressed: the hire clubs seemed
poor to me; the cafe was disappointing (salad in sandwiches is
apparently not often requested); there were many groups of kids
wandering around and the toilets were closed. On the golf side, quite a
few of the holes are uphill which causes me some problems. I’m in no
rush to return.</p>

<p><strong>City Golf</strong></p>

<p>I was given a voucher for a complimentary session at <a href="http://www.citygolfclubs.com/">City
Golf</a>, where you play golf inside,
hitting your balls towards a video screen. While this was ok for driving
practice, nothing else played as I would expect it. Putting was hopeless
and so was trying to get out of the rough - there was just no feel.
Although it was free to me, the costs seemed quite high. I doubt I am
their target market. I can’t imagine I’ll be going back anytime soon.</p>
