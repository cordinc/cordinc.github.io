    <p>Last weekend I finally saw the Tour de France live. I’m a fan of cycling
and have been to the Track World Championships, but never to the Tour.
Generally I find road racing uninteresting live - you wait around for
ages and then they go past very quickly. I made an exception for the
Tour since it is the biggest road race and there could be a good
atmosphere.</p>

<p>We arrived at Issy, a suburb of Paris, around 1pm. The tour was
scheduled to pass between 3pm &amp; 3:30pm on their way to the
Champs-Élysées. The hope was that this would avoid the crowds. A fair
assumption since the roads were deserted apart from the police. Settling
at a road side bar with a few drinks we waited. After an hour the crowds
started to build and cars began to pass us more often. Then came the
Tour caravan - a collection of advertising vehicles resembling parade
floats. I don’t have any photos of this as the crowds were 3 deep
(larger than for the cyclists!) and were desperately scrambling for the
trinkets thrown from the passing cars. We largely stayed in our seats.</p>

<p>By around 2:45pm the caravan had passed and the peloton was scheduled to
arrive soon after. Only they didn’t. The schedule was based on an
average speed of 38km/h, but the riders were obviously going much slower
and arrived around 4:30pm. It was a pleasant afternoon. I’m glad I went
and especially glad I didn’t go to the crowded end of the stage. I’d
recommend seeing it once, but I don’t feel any need to go again. Road
cycling is definitely a TV sport.</p>

<p>Below is a video of the peloton passing us. The winner Sastre (in the
yellow jersey) is in about 5th place, but there is clearly not much
racing going on. The overall results had been largely decided by this
point.</p>

    <p>On Thursday I went to the <a href="http://uk.techcrunch.com/2008/07/11/techcrunch-pitch-mini-wrap-up/">London Techcrunch Pitch!
Event</a>.
Not as a competitor - I just wanted to get an idea of the standard of
technology startups in London. I now know the standard is surprisingly
high and I have a lot of work to do if I decide to try joining them.</p>

<p>The format was first a series of 30 second pitches by firms that didn’t
quite make the grade for the later 5 minute talks - about eight of each.
Afterwards there was a vote by the audience for who was the best. My
vote went to <a href="http://www.tioti.com/">TIOTI</a> who were probably the only
one who had a product I would consider using. Although it was very close
with a few others including the winner
<a href="http://www.watzatsong.com/">WatZatSong</a> who had a good idea and a very
slick presentation. Only one of the talks I would consider bad (poor
idea and poor presentation), everyone else was good and some were very
impressive. In general the 5 minute talks were a lot better than the 30
second ones, perhaps because the longer talks were given to the more
promising firms, or perhaps because 30 seconds is a very short time to
get a point across.</p>

<p>The competition seemed to be open to firms looking for funding, from
£150K up to a few million. None required seed funding. Many were up to
their second round of proper funding. I think all had launched and some
had significant revenues. In short they all seemed at the mature end of
the startup range. Indeed there was a high incidence of grey hairs among
the presenters.</p>

<p>Many of the people there seemed to know each other (or at least they
went with friends). Before, after and sometimes during the talks, groups
were talking to each other. At times I felt like a tourist, which
strictly speaking I suppose I was. If I decide to become serious about
this startup thing then I have a lot further to go, both on the
networking side and the actual project side.</p>

    <p>Update: based on the work I detail here I have created my own
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/projects/tooltips.html">Javascript tooltip library based on
Prototype</a>.</p>

<p>Over a decade ago Borland had an IDE called Intrabuilder, which allowed
you to create websites in a Visual Basic like manner using Javascript on
the server. After leaving postgrad study I worked at a now defunct
dot.com called Electrolley for 9 months using this tool to create an
online grocery store. Serverside javascript was an idea well ahead of
its time. Indeed, javascript on the client side in 1997 was crap too.
Now <a href="http://www.prototypejs.org/">javascript is cool</a> and <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/06/rhinos-and-tigers.html">moving
forward</a>
(backwards?). With my new project, I need to return to Javascript and
the last couple of days have been a hard reintroduction.</p>

<p>I am using Prototype and Scriptaculous to make my website as easy to use
as possible. I also found some random code on the web to do tooltips -
it almost worked! Applying tooltips to Scriptaculous Sortable elements
leads to many problems, and I have just finished largely rewriting the
library.</p>

<ul>
  <li>After moving some sortable elements the tooltips of the moved
elements would be displayed underneath the unmoved elements. This is
because of the way <a href="http://www.boogdesign.com/b2evo/index.php/a/2007/06/05/scriptaculous_draggable_and_z_index">z-index stacking contexts are created in
browsers</a>.
In moving an element, Scriptacolous clones it and moves the clone,
inserting a new element when the element is dropped. This causes the
dropped item to be in a different z-index stacking context than the
other items. To get around this, the tooltips need to be drawn
outside the moved elements context. This can be done by cloning the
tooltip and then inserting it into the document at a point outside
the sortable elements’ container. I have explicitly put in the id’s
to which the tooltips is being attached, they should probably be
passed in (left as an exercise for the reader).</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_clone</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">tool_tip</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">cloneNode</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">container</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">).</span><span class="nx">insertBefore</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_clone</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">$</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">main_content</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When the tooltip needs to be hidden, just destroy the clone:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">Element</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">remove</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_clone</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_clone</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">;</span></code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>This also means the tooltip needs to be positioned absolutely, so
ensure you are using absolute screen x &amp; y coordinates.</li>
  <li>Dragging a sortable element over other elements results in a number
of mouse events firing as the elements are redrawn. Many of these
events are consumed by Scriptaculous and not passed on. Thus, the
tooltips hide and show functions may be called in any order,
resulting in spurious and permanent copies (since it is cloned) of
the tooltip all over the screen. To get around this just ensure
there is only ever once tooltip on the screen at a time, so at the
top of the show method put</li>
</ul>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">_clone</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="nx">hideTooltip</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It seems simple now I’ve fixed the problems, but it took a couple of
days to remember my old Javascript knowledge.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I was reminded recently that sometimes managers can wilfully ignore the
reality that they work with humans rather than machines. Some examples
from my past workplaces:</p>

<ul>
  <li>At a large well-known consultancy a manager used Microsoft Project
to estimate the elapsed time of a project at 6 weeks. I thought that
was impossible given the estimates for individual tasks in the
project (which I had a part in determining). The manager assured me
it was all fine because he just put the tasks into Project and that
was the date that came out. I asked to see the Project data. It
turned out that he had assumed that all people in the project would
work on the project for 5 days a week, no holidays or time off.
Problem was the project started on the 1st of December! He had
ignored Christmas, New Years and all the holiday time that people
had already booked. In the end the project was several weeks late
according to the original finish date. However, after taking the
holidays into account the project was on time, but the client
thought we were hopeless anyway because even after pointing out his
error the manager had still shown the client his original
unrealistic date!</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li>At a different firm it was generally accepted that a rota was
required to fairly apportion weekend work. The manager would assign
each weekend to a team member in turn. So who would do the first
weekend, just a few days away? Well, the person who was currently
out on holiday for the next couple of weeks of course!</li>
</ul>

<p>And just to show it is not always the managers. I was doing a short,
tactical project for a couple of financial markets’ traders (consider
them very important users). One Monday I deliver the project and they
are immediately unhappy - “unworkable and obviously wrong” they say. I
return to my desk and work on their fixes. On Tuesday I give them the
next version - “what are you thinking, worse than before” they say. I
sit down with them and they give me a 10 minute lecture on how they see
it working. I leave with a good understanding of what they want. For
Wednesday’s version they say, “perfect, why couldn’t you do this the
first time”. Only thing was I just gave them Monday’s version again!</p>

<p>Of course my lips are sealed on my stupid mistakes.</p>
