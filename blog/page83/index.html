    <p>It is done, or at least, the beginning is done. I have put the current
version of my program on the web, proceed directly to <a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queuesaurus
(www.queuesaurus.com)</a> and tame the work
beast! Please note, it should still be considered beta software.</p>

<p>So, what next? Well, I have a massive feature todo list for Queuesaurus
(soon to be transcribed to the web version of Queuesaurus in a valiant
attempt at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eat_one%27s_own_dog_food">dogfooding</a>) and
no doubt bugs will be discovered (if you find a bug or have a feature
request, add it to the “Queuesaurus Issues” queue). However, that is not
a proper answer to the question, I could keep improving Queuesaurus
nearly forever. Instead I need to know how far to pursue this or whether
to move onto other things.</p>

<p>During the last few months I have had numerous other project ideas, some
that could be a business and others that are little more than side
distractions. So far, only one has been pursued beyond thought (I’ll
blog about that later). A few times it has passed my mind to start
something new.</p>

<p>The original aims of Queuesaurus were to, at a minimum, keep working
until I had something usable and learn about setting up a web business.
I think I can just claim to have achieved the first goal, but not the
second. There is still a great deal to learn beyond the technical side.
I’m not going to leave my consulting contract just yet, nor am I ready
to advertise or properly release it, but I think it’s worth giving
Queuesaurus a bit of time to see how it goes. After that, who knows. I
also think I should head out to the occasional local tech event and get
the word out. The more people who try out Queuesaurus, the better it
will become and I’ll get a better idea of its potential.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Anyway give it a try!</a></p>

    <p>A few people have asked me if I have given up on the project and startup
idea that was the original motivation for this blog. No, I have not. A
large rewrite and a lack of testing has slowed me down. There is a very
large list of new functionality and I could of course keep working on it
nearly forever before it is “finished”. However, my experience has
suggested it is best to release early and often after a minimum level
has been reached. My project has now reached that minimum level. There
is the occasional bug, new functionality to write and the GUI is still
awkward - but what needs to be done will be clearer with people
(hopefully) using it, or at least commenting on it.</p>

<p>So this would normally be where I put a link…</p>

<p>Unfortunately/fortunately, I am on holiday the next fortnight and to
announce it seems like tempting fate a little too much. Instead I will
just describe my idea, and in mid-September give the web address. I keep
a great number of todo lists around for work and most software
development workplaces have bug tracking or project management software.
It seems to me there is a middle ground between a simple online todo
list (of which there are many) and a complex project management system
(again, there are many of these). My goal is something that can be
easily used by one person or can handle groups of people working
together. Another goal is to make it easy to use for non-IT people as
long as they are familiar with the web (thus usable by a wider audience
than many of the issue tracking systems that focus on IT people). So
there’s the plan, soon you can compare theory to reality.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Back in May I decided it was time to learn to play golf. Since then I
have been to a golf school, 2 golf courses, a driving range and an
indoor video golf centre. I thought I would write briefly about them.</p>

<p><strong>The James Andrews School Of Golf</strong></p>

<p>I signed up for a 3 day residential training course with <a href="http://golfschool.co.uk/">The James
Andrews School Of Golf</a> as a holiday. I
greatly enjoyed the break. Although I can’t claim to be a good golfer at
the moment, I can say that I am a better golfer as a result of the
course as I saw my swing improve over the 3 days (considering I
consistently missed the ball entirely at the start). Indeed most of the
course focussed on the swing. The general format was swing practice,
putting/pitching practice, and then the swing again before lunch and
having the afternoon to ourselves. Nice course, good teacher, highly
recommended (although the food could have been better considering the
cost). I certainly left feeling prepared to tackle a proper course.</p>

<p><strong>World Of Golf</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately it took a while before I managed to get myself onto a
proper golf course, so in the interim I kept up my driving skills with a
couple of visits to <a href="http://www.worldofgolf-uk.co.uk/driving+ranges/sidcup">World Of
Golf</a>, a local
driving range. I never had to queue for a bay, itis £7 for 100 balls and
you can hire clubs, not much more to say. I still go regularly.</p>

<p><strong>Hobbs Cross Golf Course</strong></p>

<p>My first proper game of golf was at <a href="http://www.hobbscrossgolfcentre.com/">Hobbs
Cross</a>. in Essex. It seemed like a
friendly course, geared towards beginners. There was a 9-hole par-3 and
another more normal 9-hole. For the record I was 57-over for the full</p>
<ol>
  <li>There was a driving range, but the cafe was closed - take your own
food just in case. A good course and I’ll go back eventually (it’s a
good distance away from where I live).</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Beckenham Place Park Golf Course</strong></p>

<p><a href="http://www.glendale-golf.com/course-7-beckenham-place.aspx">Beckenham Place
Park</a> is
probably the nearest course to my current abode. It is a cheap public
course (£50 for 2 and club hire), and is a bit harder than Hobbs Cross.
Aside from the golf, I was not greatly impressed: the hire clubs seemed
poor to me; the cafe was disappointing (salad in sandwiches is
apparently not often requested); there were many groups of kids
wandering around and the toilets were closed. On the golf side, quite a
few of the holes are uphill which causes me some problems. I’m in no
rush to return.</p>

<p><strong>City Golf</strong></p>

<p>I was given a voucher for a complimentary session at <a href="http://www.citygolfclubs.com/">City
Golf</a>, where you play golf inside,
hitting your balls towards a video screen. While this was ok for driving
practice, nothing else played as I would expect it. Putting was hopeless
and so was trying to get out of the rough - there was just no feel.
Although it was free to me, the costs seemed quite high. I doubt I am
their target market. I can’t imagine I’ll be going back anytime soon.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Yesterday was the second Poker evening I have organised. This time the
turnout was a little smaller: me, Ann, Amanda and Ury. Like last time we
played two Texas Hold’em tournaments, but the structure was a little
different. As Amanda was a complete beginner we decided to split into
pairs for heads-up tournaments for the first game. A decision with which
I was happy as this is what I mainly play during my occasional forays
online. Ury and I played each other, while Ann and Amanda went over the
basics. The second game was all four of us. Below are the games as I
remember them.</p>

<p>In the first game, I had the best of the early exchanges and built a
decent lead. Then came a hand where I had K5o; as the small blind I
3-bet and Ury called. The flop came K54o, Ury made a small bet, I went
all-in and Ury called. I was confident when he turned over K9, but when
the 9 came on the river I went from a bit ahead to way behind. I brought
myself back to par over the next 4 hands, with 3 all-in semi-bluffs (ace
high or a Q-high flush draw after the flop). Ury called me on one, my A3
caught trip 3s. The game went on as Ury slowly lost ground with poor
initial hands until forced in by the rising blinds on 10-8s (he said
that was the best starting hand he had since my run of semi-bluffs), but
beaten by my A2o with a pair of 2s. In all we played an hour and a half
with only 4 showdowns.</p>

<p>The main game started in a similar manner to the heads-up games; big
bets winning the pot without showdowns. At this point I seemed to get a
reputation as a bluffer judging by the table banter. So to answer Ury’s
question after pushing him off a pot with an all spade 9,10,J flop - I
had Q7, and open-ended straight draw with an overcard, not a complete
bluff. Ann was then so sure I was bluffing when there was a possible
straight on the board, she went all-in against me with the comment “I
know what you are pretending to have.” Ann then became the first rebuy
in our home games. The action came quickly after that. Ann busted Ury
and he bought in again right on the time limit. Amanda lost a couple of
big hands and was forced to go all-in. Ury and I joined the pot, which I
started betting big after the flop with an overcard, open-ended straight
and flush draw. Ury “ummed and ahhed”, complaining that we should do
just enough to bust Amanda, but finally called. Sensing weakness, I
continued to bet big and Ury agonised over the call. Then I went all-in
and Ury took an age to call, but finally won with two-pair against my
pair of kings. I was crippled with barely a big blind, and I was the big
blind! Without looking at my cards I went all-in 4 times in a row. Then
it was just Ann and Ury to finish. They seemed to get a little bored and
soon were all-in. Ury won on the better starting hand.</p>

<p>Again this was a lot of fun. I thought the small group may be a problem,
but it worked out very well. Also, changing the format of the games is
something worth trying again.</p>

    <p>Last weekend I finally saw the Tour de France live. I’m a fan of cycling
and have been to the Track World Championships, but never to the Tour.
Generally I find road racing uninteresting live - you wait around for
ages and then they go past very quickly. I made an exception for the
Tour since it is the biggest road race and there could be a good
atmosphere.</p>

<p>We arrived at Issy, a suburb of Paris, around 1pm. The tour was
scheduled to pass between 3pm &amp; 3:30pm on their way to the
Champs-Élysées. The hope was that this would avoid the crowds. A fair
assumption since the roads were deserted apart from the police. Settling
at a road side bar with a few drinks we waited. After an hour the crowds
started to build and cars began to pass us more often. Then came the
Tour caravan - a collection of advertising vehicles resembling parade
floats. I don’t have any photos of this as the crowds were 3 deep
(larger than for the cyclists!) and were desperately scrambling for the
trinkets thrown from the passing cars. We largely stayed in our seats.</p>

<p>By around 2:45pm the caravan had passed and the peloton was scheduled to
arrive soon after. Only they didn’t. The schedule was based on an
average speed of 38km/h, but the riders were obviously going much slower
and arrived around 4:30pm. It was a pleasant afternoon. I’m glad I went
and especially glad I didn’t go to the crowded end of the stage. I’d
recommend seeing it once, but I don’t feel any need to go again. Road
cycling is definitely a TV sport.</p>

<p>Below is a video of the peloton passing us. The winner Sastre (in the
yellow jersey) is in about 5th place, but there is clearly not much
racing going on. The overall results had been largely decided by this
point.</p>
