<br/><br/>
<p>The past weekend was <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam 2013</a>.
A gaming event where various teams create games in just 48 continuous
hours. It is not a competition; there are no prizes. The teams are
supposed to be formed at the event (not pre-formed) and the theme for
the games is announced at the start. This is to ensure the games are not
prepared in advance - they actually took just 48 hours to build. The
teams create their games at organised locations around the world and
there is a generally friendly atmosphere. In Kuala Lumpur, the event was
held in the quite plush library of <a href="http://gamedev.kdu.edu.my/">KDU University
College</a>. The bookshelves were taped off,
but there was still plenty of space and seating.</p>

<p>I only heard about this event a few hours before it began, so didn’t
participate. However, the location was open to the public at the end of
the 48 hours, when the finished games would be presented. At KL there
were 5 teams creating games around with the theme being the sound of a
heartbeat. Here are pictures of the teams presenting their games (click
on the image to go to their game page on the GGJ website).</p>

<p>I was quite impressed by the games considering how long they had to
develop them. Getting anything going in that timeframe is an
achievement. They put my productivity to shame. Although I suspect
looking around the room a few people were only awake due to caffeine and
sugar. Bath and bed were probably in the near future for most of them. A
couple of the games looked particularly good. I could see them going on
an app store as simple games with a little more polish.</p>

<p>Most of the participants were students of Game Design &amp; Development at
KDU (only 2 women though, so the standard male-female ratio in computing
continues here). Furthermore, there appears to be an active game
development community in KL. I had feared that most game development
would be sucked south to Singapore (where I know there are a couple of
studios). However, this seems to not be entirely the case. With a
university course, an active <a href="http://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a> chapter and at
least one studio which turned up to see the games too, I hopefully won’t
feel isolated.</p>

<p>It was also interesting to note that all the games were developed using
Unity3D. I think the free Unity tool really helps overcome many of the
barriers in writing modern games. I started writing simple text and
sprite games as soon as I learnt to program as a teenager in the
mid-80’s. Most of the motivation for wanting to code came initially from
wanting to make games. These primitive attempts were not too far removed
from the commercial games of the time in look and feel. It was clear how
one could write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckie_Egg">Chuckie
Egg</a> given the time and
motivation. However, after
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">Doom</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a> I
think the perceived difficulty in creating a decent game greatly
increased. It would be nice to think that tools like Unity and events
like the Game Jam, help encourage people to program by making it seem
again possible to create decent games.</p>
