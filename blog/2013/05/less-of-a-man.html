<h4>Less of a man</h4>

<p>I am now less of a man - a bit of me is missing. Three weeks ago when
walking to the shops the right side of my abdomen was aching. Nothing
too bad. The next day the ache was still there. Checking Google
suggested it wasn’t
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis">appendicitis</a> as the ache
was too high, but most of the other possibilities were also unpleasant.
I went to the local GP and promptly bounced to a local Accident &amp;
Emergency. After waiting a few hours so I could complete the required 6
hour fast for surgery, I had an emergency appendectomy. When I woke up,
my shaved stomach had 3 small holes and a missing appendix.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/appendectomy.png" alt="Appendectomy Results" title="Appendectomy Results" /></p>

<p>The surgeon described my appendix as “mucky” and “within 24 hours of
bursting”. The histology report backed this up. A burst appendix is a
serious condition, but removing it intact is just an “intermediate”
operation. Luckily it was found before rupturing as I thought acute
appendicitis caused severe pain and considered not bothering a GP.
Apparently my appendix was in an unusual position high up the abdomen.
This is why I felt no significant pain at any point - it was being
shielded by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecum">cecum</a>. Get your
long lasting abdominal pain checked out - especially if you still have
an appendix!</p>

<p>I also felt no pain after the surgery. Partly this is because the
procedure was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery">laparoscopic</a>. Only
three small incisions a centimetre or two across were made. One for a
camera to see what was happening. The others for instruments to move,
cut and remove the appendix. Now they are barely visible. Very
impressive. It all went smoothly according to the surgeon. He even
provided a recording from the inserted camera. The procedure took
exactly a few seconds over 30 minutes. The surgeon also offered a
“medical certificate”. Is this like a school participation certificate -
well done for participating on an appendectomy! I didn’t need it.</p>

<p>Some other notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>When describing possible procedures, the nurse said that the
decision on whether to do a laparoscopy was based on whether the
patient was “skinny” enough. I asked if I was skinny enough - the
nurse hesitated, umm’ed and ahh’ed, then said it was up to the
surgeon. Cue many “fat boy surgery” jokes.</li>
  <li>If I was borderline “skinny” before, now the decision would be a
little easier. I have lost 4kg in 3 weeks - from not eating for 2
days and then being on a restricted diet for the following 2 weeks.</li>
  <li>I was in a private Malaysian hospital and the care was very good.
Diplomats and partners get health insurance provided by the UK
government up to the same standard as the NHS (so I had a shared
room, etc). The total cost for 3 days in hospital plus emergency
surgery was £2500. I believe this is comparable to internal NHS
costs (as the patient pays nothing) and much cheaper than the US.</li>
  <li>The first question I was asked at the hospital was about how the
bill would be paid. I regularly heard “do you have an insurance
card?” It was all a bit surprising for someone who has only
experienced healthcare in at least partially nationalised systems
(UK and Australia). Right next the the Emergency triage nurse is a
payment station (with credit card scanner). To leave the post-op
ward I had to walk past a Payment Office (and agree to pay the bill
if the insurance firm didn’t). I can imagine it would be very
intimidating for the uninsured.</li>
