<p>Available on
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/roman-architecture-video/id341652916">iTunesU</a>
with a <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/history-art/hsar-252">course website</a>.</p>

<p>Having visited a number of ancient Roman towns and tried to determine
how and why particular buildings were constructed, this series on Roman
architecture was a must watch. It is a complete set of lecture
recordings from the Spring 2009 Roman Architecture course at
<a href="http://www.yale.edu/">Yale</a>. Similar to Yale’s <a href="/blog/2009/12/clcv-205-introduction-to-ancie.html">Ancient Greek
History</a> course, this
has been released as part of the <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/">OYC</a> program,
which has gone sadly quiet the last couple of years (perhaps overtaken
by the larger MOOCs).</p>

<p>There are 24 lectures presented by Professor Diana Kleiner, each around
75 minutes in length (available as high &amp; low quality videos, audio-only
files and transcripts). I strongly recommend watching the high-quality
videos in preference to any other format. Professor Kleiner makes
extensive use of photos (apparently many of her own) and diagrams while
lecturing. Production quality is very high throughout and Professor
Kleiner is a clear and interesting speaker.</p>

<p>Most of the lectures form a chronological survey of Roman buildings from
the late Republic through to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great">Constantine</a>.
Lectures often involve a particular theme in Roman buildings of the
time, which is illustrated by few representative examples. Most of the
buildings studied are in Rome, with a few
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii">Pompeiian</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostian</a> and other Italian
structures thrown in. There are also a couple of lectures on the
provinces. Surprisingly,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> is barely mentioned.
I didn’t notice much in the way of architectural theory, the course
seems more based in art and history. There is the occasional mention of
“the language of buildings” and “dematerialising the form”, but in
general it is possible to enjoy the lectures without a technical
background. Required information like the archetypal layout of a Roman
town, villa, temple or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermae">baths</a> is
explained in the lectures. After a only few lectures a student should be
able to spot a bathhouse in ruins or differentiate between Greek and
Roman temples.</p>

<p>The course also includes a few lectures on Roman art styles - focusing
on mosaics and wall art. At first this seemed a digression. However, as
time progressed it became clear that the Romans imagined new building
styles in art and then later built them in reality after working out the
appropriate techniques and technology. Over time buildings became larger
and more baroque as the benefits of concrete (often clad in brick)
became clearer - domes, octagons, arches and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediment">broken
pediments</a> appeared. Apart from
examining buildings to see how they were used, built and fit into
architectural trends there are also many interesting historical tidbits.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a> is named after a
nearby “colossal” statue (now gone). Buildings completed during the
reign of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius">Claudius</a> often have an
intentionally rough-hewn appearance. Professor Kleiner also provides a
travelogue of areas she clearly knows very well - next time I’m in Rome
I will definitely try out one of her 4 favourite
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelato">gelato</a> places.</p>

<p>This is a great course on Roman buildings and well worth the time. It
makes me wish I could have studied something like this at university.
Even the major assignment looked interesting - design a Roman town!</p>
