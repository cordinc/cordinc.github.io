<h4>Gamification</h4>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> is a hot topic
at the moment as people try to use the games to engage people for
various purposes. This isn’t particularly new. At high school in the
80’s we were regularly told to play supposed teaching games (“make
learning fun!”) while the teacher caught up on paperwork. The maths and
science games were generally considered crap (stronger students found it
too easy, weaker students declared it uncool). The economics games were
more popular - a stockmarket game and an economy management game.</p>

<p>Part of the economics games’ success was due to appearing more practical
and related to the outside world. However, most interest came from
competition - the games were set up to encourage players to compete
against classmates and even other schools. The aim of the stockmarket
game was to take $10,000 and through buying and selling stocks at the
closing price every Wednesday, build the largest fortune possible. Every
player’s standing was published each week compared to other students in
the class, school and state. The goal of the economic management game
was to have the largest GDP among the players after 15 years controlling
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy">fiscal</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy">monetary</a> policy. Each
school nominated a team to attend a state championship (I was on the
team that came just outside the top placings at that championship).</p>

<p>These games certainly stimulated interest, but perhaps not so much
learning. Winners tended to be the ones who gamed the game. They played
within the rules, but knowingly or otherwise, they took advantage of the
simplified reality they modeled. The stockmarket winners always had a
high risk strategy. They bought stocks going up fast (transaction costs
were ignored). Most people with this plan lost money, but with so many
players a few would do extremely well. Students with a more steady
approach made small profits, finished a little above average and were
ignored as the higher performing riskier results were feted by the
teachers. Probably the exact opposite of what should have been taught.</p>

<p>In the economy management game, we quickly learnt that the time horizon
was all important. Keeping the economy steady and safely growing
throughout the competition was a recipe for a mediocre finish. The
winning strategy was a steady economy for most of the time, but then
engineer a massive unsustainable boom right before the end of the game.
Best would be if this boom would peak in the last year, so the
inevitable subsequent deep depression never occurred in game time. At
the state championship my team pumped the economy too late. The winning
team executed the plan with the best timing. I find it hard to believe
this cynicism was the organiser’s intention. Although given subsequent
events in various countries’ economies, maybe they were making a strong
critique of politics.</p>
