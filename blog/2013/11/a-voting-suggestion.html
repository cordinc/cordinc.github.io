<h4>A Voting Suggestion</h4>

<p>Like millions of others I watched the entertaining Paxman vs Brand
interview with great interest. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Paxman">Jeremy
Paxman</a> is deservedly known
as a tough interviewer, regularly savaging experienced politicians. He
is the interviewer that asked an evasive UK minister the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwlsd8RAoqI">same question
12 times</a>. Here he is
overshadowed by the comedian/actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand">Russell
Brand’s</a> eloquence, humour
and anger.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3YR4CseY9pk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>When Brand talks about the disconnect between politicians and the
populace I think he’s right. When he talks about revolution I have to
disagree, not because his preferred replacement society is distasteful,
but because it is unlikely to result from revolution or be stable if it
did (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm">Orwell’s Animal
Farm</a>). However, what he said
about voting was very interesting.</p>

<p>Russell Brand has apparently never voted. This is because he thinks none
of the options available are worth a vote. Paxman finds this a problem.
So do I, but in a different way. The purpose of voting in the UK is to
capture the desires of the population towards which party should govern.
Most constituencies only give a voter a choice of two realistic options,
in safe seats there is only one option (hopefully that is the one you
want!). It is likely that a valid vote comes down to choosing the least
of two evils. Brand is saying he chooses neither evil. A view with which
I have some sympathy and I suspect many others do too.</p>

<p>The situation is worse in Australia where it is illegal not to vote
correctly. This translates into it being a fineable offence not to turn
up to a voting station on election day, since it is a secret ballot and
no one knows what is actually on your ballot paper. This has led people
with views similar to Russell Brand to suggest intentionally spoiling
your vote or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_vote">donkey voting</a>
as a protest. However, little attention is paid to these invalid votes
as people rationalise that they are due to stupidity.</p>

<p>In the “2010 UK General Election the turnout was
65”:http://www.ukpolitical.info/2010.htm. How many of the 35 that didn’t
vote are like Russell Brand, and how many didn’t care? How many of the
65% only voted out of obligation, because it is supposed to be the right
thing to do, but still sympathise with Brand? How many of the invalid
votes in Australia are a protest and how many are real errors? I’d like
to know.</p>

<p>Leaving aside questions on the voting or political system, here is a
simple suggestion to find out.</p>

<p>Add an official “None of the above” option to the bottom of all ballot
papers.</p>

<p>The “None of the above” votes could be ignored for the sake of deciding
a winner, but should be reported alongside the candidate totals. It is
important they are publicly reported. They would serve as an indication
of the democracy’s health. A low percentage of “none” votes suggest all
is well. A high percentage and the system has problems. Either the
candidates are not meeting the electorate’s desires or the voting system
as a whole is not working. As any management consultant will tell you,
the first step to solving a problem is measuring it.</p>

<p>I suspect the level of “none” votes would be disturbingly high, and this
is the main impediment to implementation. Politicians would be
embarrassed and their mandate weakened by a high level of “none” votes
in their constituency. It would take a person confident in their support
or egoless to happily to initiate such a change to the system. I’m not
sure these are common traits among current politicians. Still a little
embarrassment is a small price to quantify growing apathy and maybe
prevent the government sleepwalking into revolution (as Russell Brand
hopes). Counting “none” votes would provide the information in a public,
unambiguous and non-partisan manner.</p>
