<h4>Kickstarter Report</h4>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Kickstarter.html">Kickstarter</a>
    
<br/><br/>
<p>The <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> website allows people to
pledge money towards the completion of various projects (games, movies,
products, or lots of other ideas). Usually the project organisers give
something in return and keep in communication with backers. I joined
last September specifically to back a certain project (see the first
project below). Since then I have backed 10 more projects. My only rule
(so far) is never to back a project at a level which includes physical
goods - I don’t need more stuff.</p>

<p>It appears to be an emerging tradition to detail the result of backing
Kickstarter projects. As I haven’t backed a new project in nearly 3
months, and many have finished, it seemed a good time to reflect on my
experiences. In order of when I pledged, my backed projects are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">Project
Eternity</a>
<em><span class="ongoing 14, Apr due 12, Sep pledged"></span></em> - Me and
nearly 74,000 of my mates backed this little computer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">RPG</a>. It is one of
the more successful Kickstarters, and is the reason I joined the
site. It is being built to a similar design and by a similar team to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planescape:_Torment">Planescape:
Torment</a> - that is
enough of a sales pitch for me, I pledged enough to get a copy on
release. Since being funded, the project team sends weekly updates
on their progress. I am fairly comfortable waiting for this game.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/10x10room/conclave">Conclave</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Feb due 12, Sep pledged"></span></em> - This
project was backed on a a whim when it appeared unlikely it would
reach its target. Now I understand that total pledges tend to surge
in the final day, as it did in this successful project. It is a
HTML5 RPG game where the first 10 missions are free (<a href="http://www.playconclave.com/">playable
here</a>). The team delivered all they
promised, largely on time. I have played through about half the
current game and it is a decent enough distraction for a couple of
hours. No regrets here.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035580424/blackspace-plan-dig-defend-survive">Blackspace</a>
<em><span class="unsuccessful 12, Oct pledged"></span></em> - The only
project I backed that did not reach its funding goal. This is a
computer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">RTS</a> game
when the player builds and defends facilities on asteroids. I had a
very similar idea and was keen to see how theirs’ looked.
Unfortunately, little progress has been made (if any) since the
funding failure - a pity.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/sir-you-are-being-hunted">Sir, You Are Being
Hunted</a>
<em><span class="late 13, Jul due 12, Nov pledged"></span></em> - A very
cool looking “tweedpunk”
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">FPS</a> game where
you are hunted by robots dressed like English country gentlemen. The
game is in alpha and available on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>. It is technically running
late, but since the current version is playable and the
oversubscribed kickstarter resulted in many stretch goals, I’m not
worried.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1473965863/sui-generis">Sui
Generis</a>
<em><span class="ongoing 14, May due 12, Nov pledged"></span></em> - A very
impressive and ambitious tech demo for this computer RPG led me to
back it. There were a number of original ideas planned for the game
and I deemed it worth a try. Since then communication has been
sporadic, but gameplay videos show progress. I just doubt this can
be finished in the next 6 months, even another year seems like a
stretch to me. Hopefully the team won’t run out of money or descope
too heavily. Perhaps they could license their engine to other
developers.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core">Fate Core</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Feb due 13, Jan pledged"></span></em> -
Another massively oversubscribed Kickstarter for a pen &amp; paper RPG.
There were so many stretch goals achieved on this one the value for
money became too good to pass up, even for people with only a
passing interest. Most of the backer rewards have been delivered (a
couple of the later stretch goals remain), and the quality seems
very high.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/enworld/rebuilding-en-world">EN
World</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Mar due 13, Jan pledged"></span></em> -
Before this Kickstarter I was aware of the <a href="http://www.enworld.org/">EN
World</a> website and considering joining to
help find local RPG groups (I didn’t join because it turns out
Facebook is the way RPG’ers connect in Malaysia). Then the site was
hacked and went to raise money to resurrect the site offering a ton
of pen &amp; paper RPG rewards for backers. Now the site is back (and I
joined, but mainly for the news) and the high-quality rewards
distributed (so many I haven’t had the opportunity to go through
them all yet!).</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2005963869/jeff-cannatas-new-show">Jeff
Cannata</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Apr due 13, Mar pledged"></span></em> - For
many years I watched Jeff Cannata as one of the 3 hosts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Totally_Rad_Show">The
Totally Rad
Show</a>. It was a
free, fun and informative podcast. When he went to Kickstarter to
raise money for a new (although similar) podcast, I felt he deserved
some money from me for the hours of entertainment already provided.
Even better, my mate Jeff has now delivered the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CannataJeff">Newest Latest
Best</a> podcast. It lacks the
chemistry of TRS, but is still very good and I happily watch it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/achtung-cthulhu-the-ww2-keepers-and-investigators">Achtung
Cthulhu!</a>
<em><span class="delivered partially 13, Aug due 13, Mar pledged"></span></em> -
Cthulhu mythos adventures during World War 2. This pen &amp; paper RPG
was an easy sell to me. The original products from the Kickstarter
have been delivered, with the numerous stretch goal rewards still to
come. The quality of the books exceeded my expectations - very
impressive. I have also started playing in a AC! game and can
strongly recommend it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1281758745/professional-mp3-background-loops-for-role-playing">RPG Background
Loops</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Aug due 13, Apr pledged"></span></em> - This
set of 80 background loops (each 10 minutes long) for RPG games was
backed on a whim. They are fine, but I’m not sure when I will get to
use them.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/545820095/weird-wars-rome-savage-worlds">Weird Wars
Rome</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Sep due 13, Aug pledged"></span></em> - Like
Achtung Cthulhu, an easy sell with a combination of Cthulhu mythos
in an Ancient Rome environment. Unfortunately, I have been
unimpressed with the quality of the delivered book - much lower than
the other Kickstarters I’ve backed. Disappointing.</li>
</ul>

<p>So after 10 projects backed successfully, only one is (forgivably) late,
one is a concern, and one had a disappointing result. I consider that a
good result and wouldn’t be apprehensive about backing more.</p>
