<p><a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> mining is a method of turning
electricity into money. That aphorism percolated around my mind for some
time until it dawned that I don’t currently pay the full cost of
electricity. Unfortunately, while that situation has existed nearly a
year, it will end in a month. Cursing my sloth, I decided to experiment
with mining Bitcoins on my PC, and see how much profit can be made from
spare electricity.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is the most popular and valuable form of crypto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency">digital
currencies</a>. That is, a
form of money that exists only in digital form and is “created” through
the solving of cryptographic problems (known as “mining”). There is no
government or bank backing Bitcoin - so if there is a problem it is
largely down to the community to look after itself. However, the
problems solved by “mining” are actually checks on Bitcoin transactions,
thus it is quite hard to hack the currency itself (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24871444">hacking banks that
hold Bitcoin balances</a> is
another issue entirely). From its origin in 2009 Bitcoin has continually
grown in presence and value - at the time of writing it is <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/">US$228 to
the Bitcoin</a>.</p>

<p>So I put my ageing desktop to work. Three years ago it was a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/01/building-a-new-pc.html">top end
gaming box</a>,
now it is middle of the road. Especially the Nvidia graphics card which
is utilised heavily in mining calculations. After downloading a <a href="https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer">mining
program</a> and joining a <a href="https://www.btcguild.com/">mining
pool</a> (which combines members’ efforts and
shares the proceeds), my PC was dedicated to its task. After 72 hours of
continuous mining I accumulated 0.0004 Bitcoins - just under 8 US cents.
It was actually worse than that as the pool only pays out in units of
0.01 Bitcoins, so it would have taken mining 72 more days before
receiving anything. Not really worthwhile.</p>

<p>The pool’s combined computing power increased 10% over just the 4 days I
was watching, and apparently this is consistent with growth in total
power devoted to Bitcoin mining. Thus the amount earnt by a miner with
fixed power (like my PC) should decrease at the same rate (over
10%/week) - a rapid decline. Bitcoin mining is increasing exponentially
and as the supply is released at a fixed rate, only more powerful mining
rigs now earn back their costs. The most powerful miners are special
built <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC
machines</a>,
normal PCs can’t compete. It may be after electricity and purchase costs
even the new purpose built equipment can’t compete either! It seems only
the manufacturers are profiting - just like the gold rushes of old.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency, just the most well known and
developed. There are many others (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">list of some is
here</a>). Some use
a different type of calculation for different purposes, for example
adding inflation or making it harder to use specially built miners. I
did the same experiment (same machine, same time period) with two lesser
known and less liquid currencies: <a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> and
<a href="http://feathercoin.com/">Feathercoin</a>.</p>

<p>If I mined continuously for 100 days at late October 2013 difficulty and
market prices, the result would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin -&gt; 0.013 btc = US$2.60</li>
  <li>Litecoin -&gt; 5.2 ltc = US$10.40</li>
  <li>Feathercoin -&gt; 224 ftc = US$15.68</li>
</ul>

<p>All of which are probably less than the cost of electricity used. I
doubt anyone is going to get rich unless they buy high end machines or
specialist equipment - and take some large risks.</p>

<p>The experiment is now over.</p>
