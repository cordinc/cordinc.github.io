<p>This is the story of the 5-year
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign I
played in while at high-school. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/dd-campaign-history-part-1.html">Part 1 of the
story</a>
follows the ever-changing party through a series of unconnected dungeon
crawls. Now after about a year of play, the group has settled down into
a bunch or regulars around level 5 under the old first edition D&amp;D
rules. Having gained significant powers, money and notoriety they are
becoming noticed by local rulers.</p>

<p>The party consisted of 5 characters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Bandance - a pyromaniac evil wizard, often getting in arguments with
the rest of the party</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Ugarit - a fighter</li>
</ul>

<p>The party sailed into Karameikos on their return leg from the primitive
southern isles they recently explored (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dread">Isle Of
Dread</a>). Before heading
back to their home in the northern borderlands a week’s march to the
north, they planned to spend a few days in the large civilised city -
enjoying its delights and spending their recently acquired gold. They
quickly found themselves surrounded by the city guardsmen and required
to present themselves to the local Duke (technically their liege, as
their hometown was just inside his territory). He had a proposition. A
distant ally of the Duke required some irregular soldiers to deal with a
number of hostile nomads raiding his lands. If the party agreed to help
the ally he would pardon a number of treasonous offences they committed
in the course of their earlier adventures (aiding certain hostile
northern Elvish tribes). The party agreed and went to join the foreign
army as it assembled. Thus started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Desert_Nomads">Master of the Desert
Nomads</a>.</p>

<p>Upon arriving at the assembly point the party realised they were late
and joined a bunch of stragglers on their way to join the army. However,
after a few days and many bruising skirmishes with various monsters, the
party became separated from the larger group. Increasingly lost in river
marshes and hunted by an evil force, I realised the party had a problem.
The adventure was too hard for the characters’ level. I had been using
my character, Bandance, as a backstop, but this wasn’t enough. When
Kur-Tas prayed to his war-god I had an idea. Kiri-Jolith himself
appeared and offered the party help. The party received a staff of
healing and resurrection (only usable by a lawful cleric) and in return
they needed to destroy a certain evil artefact at the gates of hell. The
quest was distant; it would be many years of game time before it was
complete. The staff was of immediate use. An immensely powerful item -
once a month it could heal someone to almost full heath and also
instantly resurrect a dead person if they were of good standing with
Kiri-Jolith. Thus both the front line fighters (Talin &amp; Ugarit) could
fight the death once a month with essentially no penalty. It was like
adding an extra fighter to the party. After this point there were a few
jokes about how often Talin died - I think he got upto around 9 deaths
by the time the game faded away.</p>

<p>With the fear of death quickly receding from their minds the party
slaughtered their way out of the marshes and joined a merchant caravan
crossing the desert. After crossing the desert they met up with some
friendly nomads. Here they learnt that their army had been defeated and
that the enemy nomad army was held together by the power of the Master,
an evil priest from the nearby land of Hule. The party resolved to
defeat the army by travelling to Hule and assassinating this “Master”.</p>

<p>On the way to the mountain pass to Hule they fought a number of tough
battles - most notably at an abbey guarding the pass to Hule full of
evil doppelgangers (pretending to be good priests). The party’s
naturally suspicious demeanour served them well and the deceit was
quickly uncovered. I think it was around this point that the person
playing Ugarit left the campaign after personal differences with some
other players. I vaguely remember (probably apocryphally) that after the
player left, Ugarit went down nobly fighting a rearguard action as the
rest of the party escaped the abbey and headed into the mountain pass.</p>

<p>Now down to 4 characters, the party transitioned to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Death">Temple of
Death</a> adventure (which
began in the pass). Easily getting through the pass and then staying
hidden while crossing Hule, the party came upon the Master’s temple
headquarters without much difficultly. They then spent some time
observing the site and its surrounds. Finding a hidden passage into the
complex and (correctly) guessing that the Master would be at the top of
the temple, the party moved quickly to the climax. After defeating the
Master and then escaping by flying away, they began their return home.</p>

<p>The return was most notable for an argument. By now my character,
Bandance, was causing serious friction within the party. As I knew the
details of every encounter, Bandance didn’t participate much in the
discussions of what to do (so as not to give anything away). In combat
he stayed back and blasted fire-based spells at opponents, and ran at
the first sign of more serious trouble (he was not in good standing with
Kiri-Jolith and thus could not be resurrected by Kur-Tas Kai’s staff).
He would demand a larger than fair share of the treasure and generally
caused problems. By the time the game reached Hule, it was clear he
would have to go, but it never seemed like the right time. The extra
firepower a second spellcaster brought was very handy. However, in the
end the party made the decision I couldn’t.</p>

<p>In the first town the party reached after leaving the desert, Bandance
and Greymarel had an argument in a tavern over a magic item (I can’t
remember exactly what it was). The rest of the party all quickly
supported Greymarel and it escalated fast. I had Bandance jump out the
window and run into the market crowds. The party didn’t give chase - I
wouldn’t have let them catch them if they had, he was too useful as a
villain. From here on, every time there the party heard of a mad, evil
wizard the comment was “is it Bandance?” Whether or when, he would
return and seek vengeance was a recurring discussion, as was teasing me
that my character had got whooped.</p>

<p>The party was now down the three members, and quickly realised that a
new member was required. A new player was found, but he wouldn’t be able
to play until after the holidays - another month or so. In the meantime
the characters travelled back to Karameikos collected their rewards and
new orders. All the players were by now fantastically rich by local
standards with tens of thousands of gold each. I was concerned they may
want to settle down rather than adventure so reminded them of their duty
to the Duke and their quest for Kiri-Jolith. I needn’t have worried;
they were keen to hit the road. The Duke pointed them in the direction
of the Isle of Dawn where an ongoing war between his allies the
“Thyatian’s”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyatis and the opposed
“Alphatian’s”: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphatia had reached
deadlock. Perhaps they could help out?</p>

<p>The trip to the Isle of Dawn took about a month’s worth of realtime -
very handily meaning the journey’s completion matched up with the start
of our new player. On the way the party generally messed about with
freeform play through various cities. Drinking, wenching and brawling
were the order of the day. They also spent a few days vanquishing a mad
mage in his inverted tower.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/rpg/Inverted_Tower.pdf"><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/IT_Preview.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Upon arrival at the Isle of Dawn the party met up with Raven, a human
fighter. Over 7 feet tall and with spikes covering his armour, he became
instant friends with the characters and joined the party. I’ve always
found it difficult to arrange a decent story for why a new player joins
a party. Here there was no attempt. More a case of “hey, you look cool,
what to adventure with us?”. Oh well, it worked out ok. Thus after two
years of play the party was back up to 4 characters, all around level 7.</p>

<p>Next up the party does a little soldiering, but can’t stop thinking
about how to complete their dangerous quest for Kiri-Jolith. <a href="/blog/2014/01/dd-campaign-history-part-3.html">Part 3 is
