<p>After completing a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Scala
course</a>
on <a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> in November, I was ready to try
another. Since I have an interest in astronomy I signed up for the <a href="http://duke.edu/">Duke
University</a> <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/introastro">Introduction to
Astronomy</a> course. After
eight weeks of lectures and assignments it has just finished.</p>

<p>Whenever there is an astronomy documentary on TV, I usually tune in for
at least the first few minutes. Normally I turn them off fairly quickly
as most are aimed too low or just go too slow. The last one I watched
contained about 15 minutes worth of information in it’s 60 minutes run
time. There was no similar problem with this course. While it started
gently with positional astronomy and Newtonian physics, it quickly moved
on with a week each on planets, stars, stellar evolution, relativity,
galaxies and cosmology.</p>

<p>While many of the facts in the roughly 3-4 hours of lectures per week
were not new to me, the course also covered how those facts are
mathematically determined. Thus while a documentary my say something
like “after 10 billion years the Sun will start to expand”, this course
goes further. It presents the maths to calculate the amount of energy
released by nuclear reactions in a star’s core; how quickly the fuel for
these reactions is exhausted and how the pressure inside the star
changes at this point (including quantum effects like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure">electron
degeneracy
pressure</a>).
The maths stops just short of calculus (thus many formulas are presented
without derivation), so high school level is adequate to understand
everything presented.</p>

<p>There was an assignment every week requiring usage of the maths
presented to solve various problems. This is where the course let itself
down. The first assignment was hard, had a one week deadline and did not
inform the student where they were going wrong. After close to 16 hours
of effort I submitted on time and as the deadline passed received my
grade of 95%. Although I was quite proud, I did not have the time to
continue with the course if the future assignments continued in the same
fashion. The hours were not reasonable, especially for a course that
advised spending 6-8 total hours/week. However, it seemed that many
other people complained, so all further assignments had a 3 week
deadline, allowed multiple submissions and gave instant feedback. Still
assignments normally took me around 6 hours - so the course was an
unexpected time sink. Furthermore, the lectures and marking scheme often
contained mistakes that impacted assignment questions. It is extremely
frustrating to try solving a problem, getting feedback that it is wrong
and spending time trying to work out the error when it is in fact a
mistake caused by the lecturer! I soon learned to wait and only start
assignments after they had been available a week (by which time the
errors had been spotted and fixed).</p>

<p>A very interesting and informative class - unfortunately marred by
assignment errors and required more time than expected.</p>
