<p>Over last last weekend was both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day">Australia
Day</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaipusam">Thaipusam</a>. I went to both and
saw how they are celebrated here in KL in different ways.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/Flag_of_Australia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Australia Day appears to be the premier event in the local diplomatic
community. The Australian diplomatic mission is one of the largest in
town and they aim to impress with their national day celebrations.
However, it wasn’t like any Australia Day event I’ve been to before. For
a start the invite said lounge suit. My memories of Australia Day are
t-shirt optional (because there is a pool) with a BBQ followed by
fireworks and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_J_Hottest_100">Hottest
#100</a>. The event
here is far swishier. It was held in a large exhibition hall, with
projection screens and unobjectionable Australian music playing.</p>

<p>My first impression was of a school ball. Not helped by the first food
station encountered being a chocolate fountain. Although after that the
comparison fails, with a large array of excellent food options
available, including Waygu beef,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamington">lamingtons</a> and a whole fresh
tuna flown in specially that day (morning in Australia, evening in KL).
All presented on little bite-sized dishes so it was easy to try a wide
range of dishes. The audience appeared to be largely the KL diplomatic
community with some local VIPs. Speaking to many of them, they were
deeply impressed with the event and the cost implied. It seems the
Australians set the bar high and dare other diplomatic mission to try
topping it. With austerity all the rage in the rest of world, I don’t
think anyone else makes the attempt.</p>

<p>Thaipusan is a Hindu festival from southern India, where followers make
offerings to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan">Murugan</a>. This may
be in the form of a pot of milk or the hair from a freshly shaved head
or even piercing the body with needles and hooks. In Malaysia, the
holiday is held at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Caves">Batu Caves</a>
with over a million visitors during the 3 day event.</p>

<p>We visited on the first night and rarely have I seen so many people. The
caves were packed shoulder to shoulder, as were the stairs upto the
caves and the assembly area. Around that was a large expanse of food
stalls, trinket shops, shrines, head shaving areas and more. All rammed
with more people. Gratifyingly, the large red crescent blood donation
area was also completely full. It was a bit overwhelming. There was loud
drumming, people hooked (literally) into decorated canopies, and colour
everywhere (mainly yellow). It was all quite good natured.</p>
