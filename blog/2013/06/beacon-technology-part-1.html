<p>After deciding to leave <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/02/rio-tinto-rtd.html">Rio
Tinto</a> in 2000
my job search was initially half-hearted. It was late in the year and
not many jobs were being advertised in the run-up to Christmas. My plan
at this stage was just to see what was around before starting a proper
job search in the new year. However, the recruitment agent that put me
in <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/electrolley.html">Electrolley</a>
happened to cold-call. With a fortnight I accepted the first job
offered. I never regretted the fast move to the small independent
consulting shop <a href="http://www.beacon.com.au/">Beacon Technology</a> (now they
are part of a larger group).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/beacon.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>The interview was not particularly onerous. I got all ready and went to
meet a co-founder of the small 30-person company. It turned out in a
previous job he worked with the founders of Electrolley and had already
checked up on me. Since my references were good, the interview was more
a friendly chat. The closest to a hard question came when the co-founder
said he couldn’t pay me what I was on at Rio Tinto and offered a
slightly lower sum. I suggested I would be happy to accept the lower
amount now if after six months it was reviewed. We were both happy with
that compromise and I started the new year at Beacon.</p>

<p>Beacon Technology was started by two workmates as a consulting shop, I
believe after they were made redundant. The company soon acquired a key
client by developing a large system for an insurance consortium. By the
time I joined the steady money from this work paid for around 30
employees. Half worked on the steady, but “unsexy” insurance product;
about a quarter worked on short-term development consulting projects; a
couple of people worked as systems admins for a managed hosting business
(the main clients were insurance companies); and, the rest were support
(managers, assistants). I joined the smaller consultant developers team.
Considering the time (early 2000) much of our work was for dotcom
companies who had problems finding developers. The more senior people
(mainly the founders) did some software development process consulting.</p>

<p>Beacon was a strong proponent of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process">Rational Unified Process
(RUP)</a>. The
company was even the authorized Rational reseller for Western Australia.
Not much marketing was done, but there was a steady stream of interest.
Some of this resulted in consulting work, some in development work and
every few months a course was held. All developers needed to know and
use the RUP (and most of us went on the training course too). Although
the managers took a very practical approach towards the very extensive
and detailed process (an important point often missed by clients and
others using the RUP). Use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Software">Rational
Rose</a> modeling system
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language">UML
diagrams</a> was
effectively mandatory, but then it was mad not to use them as the
company had developed such an impressive set of tools and plugins around
them. Their tool to generate code from Rose models was particularly good
and better then the inbuilt version (I suggested Beacon could sell it,
but the owners weren’t keen on that idea). The core ideas
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_and_incremental_development">iteration</a>)
and documents (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case">use cases</a>) were
always kept. Apart from that it was all optional as long as you had
justification for the decision. Parts of the process were happily
dropped as deemed necessary on a project-by-project basis. Beacon was
also the first placed I worked with proper testing. The testers had to
be happy with anything the developers produced and they definitely
tested well.</p>

<p>The company’s focus was on practicality and a “get it done” attitude.
This was something I learnt starting from my first project. At the time
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dotcom boom</a> was
reaching its peak and there was a good pipeline of development work for
various “ideas” people and bricks’n’mortar firms desperate not to miss
the boat (and prove they did “get the Internet”). Interestingly while
the boom started turning to bust just a few months after joining Beacon
(March 2000), the dotcom work didn’t start drying up until the end of
the year. I first worked on a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business-to-business">B2B</a> ecommerce site.
I think it was specifically for hotels. Another relatively new hire
acted as project leader with me being the only other person on the team.
He was seen as an old hand, having done consulting development work for
over 15 years. Beacon had no age discrimination - they also hired an
over 40+ guy who had just graduated with a Computer Science degree after
a first career as an itinerant English teacher and surfer in South
America.</p>

<p>I was a little arrogant after getting
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/electrolley.html">Electrolley’s</a>
website running largely by myself and then working among the PhDs at Rio
Tinto R&amp;TD. I went from being one of the least educated in the
workplace, to being one of the most educated. I thought I knew exactly
what I was doing, but got a rude awakening. My new project leader taught
me the benefit of experience with a practical outlook. If I complained
about some poor code someone else had written, he would ask if it
worked. If there was a problem with it he would ask how I planned to fix
it. At one point I had a plan to create a monumental generic data-driven
bootstrapping config system. The project leader said it sounded
ambitious but let me try writing it on my own time. A fortnight later I
came to tell him the technical reasons it wouldn’t work without making
the situation worse. I got the impression he knew how it would end
before it started and just wanted me to see the hard way that simple
solutions often work best. From him, I learnt that the main job was
fulfilling the customer’s needs and after that had been achieved we
should focus on architectural purity and beautiful code. Both are
important, but complete and correct functionality is foremost. We could
also (and often did) refactor after knowing what was required.</p>

<p>There was some quite awful external code to complain about in the B2B
project. It had been mandated that we use a B2B system sold by a large
US firm. The client had purchased this system before working out what
they needed and so hired us to add all the functionality that the system
did not provide. I saw this “buy first, then work out what to do with
it” attitude twice among Beacon’s clients and once elsewhere - I can
only assume some salespeople are incredibly persuasive because I just
don’t understand it. Some of the functionality requested required us to
hook deeply into the purchased system’s code and we worked out a way
replace the system’s code with ours (by playing around with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classpath">classpath</a>). To do this
properly and legally we needed the system’s source code, but the US firm
was reluctant to give it to us. While negotiations for the source
continued, we decompiled it so we could get started. We mightly cursed
the decompiler. The result was an awful mess of spaghetti code, long
rambling methods with no comments and meaningless names - just bad code.
After battling through and completing the project the US firm finally
gave us access to their source. Then we did mightly praise the
decompiler. The decompiled code matched perfectly the code supplied to
us - even down to the “x1”, “x2” variable naming scheme.</p>

<p>After the B2B site, I worked on a website selling alcoholic drinks. My
task was creating the payment gateway. It took the credit card details
and communicated with the bank to ensure correct payment. The difficulty
was that the client wanted to be able to handle thousands of
transactions per hour and the gateway had a little bug that caused
sporadic slowdowns. A set of multithreaded payment queues solved the
issues and we successfully tested the system well past the desired
throughput. When the site went live, one of Beacon’s owners was the
first person to put an order through (and on his personal card). I was
very nervous, but it worked fine. There were also no payment problems
for the next 100 or so orders that occurred before the site went bust 3
months later.</p>

<p>After that I worked on adding functionality to an existing system for a
bloodstock auctioneer. I never even knew such a business existed until
starting work on the project. Bloodstock auctioneers arrange the sale of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoroughbred">thoroughbred racehorses</a>,
usually through a few large auctions held annually. The value of such a
horse is determined largely by its genetic potential as demonstrated by
its results and its ancestors results. In fact a horse is bordering on
unsalable if it is not possible to show its lineage back to the original
three thoroughbred stallions brought to England from Arabia in the 18th
century. Thus it is vitally important when selling to have a large
database of thoroughbred family trees and racing results. The auction
catalogue would detail the horses’ results (which the seller usually
knew) and the notable results of ancestors (which the seller usually did
not know). Beacon had produced a system the previous year that given a
set of horse to be auctioned, looked up their details and ancestors in a
database and then produced the auction catalogue in both PDF and HTML
for publication. For a few months I adjusted the rules determining what
counted as “notable” and prettied up the output according to the
client’s wishes. It was easy work as the existing code was beautifully
written and easy to modify.</p>

<p>When I had been at Beacon about 8 months I reminded the owners our
agreement to review my salary. They apologised for forgetting and
arranged a date to discuss it. To prepare I looked around the other
developers at the firm. I explained the situation to one who I thought
was equivalent in skill to me, and asked if he would let me know the
rough range of his salary as I would ask for about the same. He stated a
range where the top end was just below my current salary. I was shocked,
but had no reason to disbelieve him. I suggested he might be able to
earn a bit more elsewhere. He replied that Beacon was the best placed he
had worked and he didn’t want to go elsewhere. When it came time to meet
with the owners, I said any amount they suggested would be fine - and
meant it. They offered a 33% pay raise. I accepted feeling a little
guilty. Luckily the questioned workmate never asked the result of the
meeting and I never talked about salary again at Beacon.</p>

<p>Thus ended my first year at Beacon. The company was nearing 50 employees
and had expanded onto a second office floor. There was always work to do - no <a href="http://glossary.tenrox.com/bench-time.htm">bench time</a> at this
consulting shop. I was quite confident and happy about my time there and
ambitious to do better. The second year was not so happy.</p>
