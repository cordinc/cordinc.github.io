<h4>Ramadan in KL</h4>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadan</a> is the Islamic month of
fasting, where followers refrain from eating during daylight hours. As a
very important part of their faith and culture, I have seen many
otherwise non-observant Muslims perform the fast. When living in
Australia I only knew of Ramadan from TV or books. In Britain I had
workmates and friends fasting, but most of the country remained
unaffected. Now I’m in Malaysia, a multicultural majority Muslim country
with large non-Muslim minorities. How does Ramadan work here?</p>

<p>Kuala Lumpur (and Malaysia in general) is food obsessed - and rightly
so. There is an abundance of cheap, tasty food with Chinese, Indian,
Thai and Malay influences. There are resturants and food stalls
everywhere. Anywhere there is a walk of more than a few minutes to get
food is glaring gap in the market soon addressed by a new roadside food
stall. Quality is uniformly high, I have yet to hear of anyone getting
sick at even the dodgiest popup stall. Eating out is very common. There
seems to always be a few people in each resturant from opening to late
closing.</p>

<p>Ramadan started this year in mid-July and ran to early August. Thus 61%
of the Malaysian population that is Muslim could not eat between 6am and
7:30pm. Walking through a outer suburban shopping area at lunchtime the
affect was clear. Of the 11 food places I walked past on the way to my
gym, 8 were closed. The remainder were fairly empty. One of them hadn’t
put out half its seating. In the city more places are open, probably
only a quarter are closed at lunchtime. Although everywhere is quieter
with less business. A couple of fast food places (while open) used the
time for renovations.</p>

<p>The law in Malaysia says it is actually illegal for a Muslim to eat
during daylight hours in Ramadan. It is also illegal to serve a Muslim.
This means anyone who looks Muslim to local eyes (which means Malay or
Arab) will find it nearly impossible to be served regardless of their
religious status. Similar laws exist outside Ramadan for halal food and
alcohol.</p>

<p>As dusk approaches pop-up take-away food stalls and special markets
open. There are hugely more stalls than normal (double at least) and
they appear even in areas none were previously (for example a curry puff
stall started outside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronas_Towers">KLCC twin
towers</a> - I doubt that
would normally be allowed). They all sell food to be taken home by
people leaving work and do brisk business.</p>

<p>One night we went out for dinner aiming arriving at 7pm to beat the
perceived fast breaking rush (reservations are almost never required).
We were too late. The first half dozen places we went had no free
tables. They were full of people patiently waiting for the alloted time
(this was in KLCC). We eventually found a Taiwanese resturant that
appeared to have an order-or-leave policy.</p>

<p>Ramadan ends with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr">Hari Raya</a>
(known as Eid in most of the world). This is a multi-day public holiday
that has been described to me as having equivalent cultural and
religious significance as Christmas has to Christian cultures. Here in
Malaysia it is celebrated with feasts (of course) and open houses. This
is where various people put on free lunches to anyone who wishes to eat.
There are a lot of them. Politicians and local services (the nearby
police station held one) are almost required to provide one, but many
normal people hold them too. It is all open, public and friendly. It is
quite different to the private family only Christmas meals to which I’m
familiar. Many locals have stories of visiting other countries and
turning up to shocked friends’ Christmas lunches unannounced as they
thought it was similarly open.</p>
