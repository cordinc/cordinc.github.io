<h4>MITx: A Global History Of Architecture</h4>

<p>Nearly <a href="/blog/2011/01/a-global-history-of-architectu.html">3 years ago I
wrote</a> about
receiving the textbook “A Global History Of Architecture” in return for
the use of one of my photos of Pompeii. When I discovered the
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> course given online by one of the authors and
using this textbook, I had to signup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Global-History-Architecture-Francis-Advisor/dp/0470402571/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293707766&amp;sr=8-2"><img src="/assets/posts/global_history_of_architecture.jpg" alt="A Global History Of Architecture" /></a></p>

<p>The couse is called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-4-605x-global-history-architecture-884">A Global History Of
Architecture</a>
(yes, the same as the textbook), available through
<a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a> and instructed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jarzombek">Mark
Jarzombek</a>. EdX is another
of the online university course providers, similar to the previously
discussed <a href="/blog/tag/Coursera.html">Coursera</a> although with a different
(but strangely overlapping) set of universities involved. Other than
graphic design, there is very little difference between EdX and
Coursera; the manner of instruction, facilities and testing are all
largely the same. A student should just signup wherever they find
interesting courses.</p>

<p>At 12 weeks this is very long for an online course - 8 weeks of lectures
regularly interspersed by 4 weeks with just an exam. The exams barely
qualify as such. None took me more than 20 minutes (the notes suggest an
hour) to complete the various multiple choice and categorisation
questions. Each lecture week includes over 3 hours of video instruction
(cut up into roughly 10 minute segments) with mini-tests. However, these
videos are not specially made for EdX. They are actual university
lectures from MIT - the back of the original students’ heads can
sometimes be seen. The lectures are the jewel in this course. Professor
Jarzombek presents well and is clearly talking on topics that greatly
interest him.</p>

<p>While the topic is nominally architectural history, it is more a general
history of the world illuminated with architectural examples (more <a href="/blog/2011/07/a-history-of-the-world-in-100.html">A
History of the World in 100
Objects</a> than <a href="/blog/2013/09/hsar-252-roman-architecture.html">Roman
Architecture</a>). There is
also regular and interesting discussion of trade flows and migration
patterns through history and how these promoted the interchange of ideas
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memes">memes</a> I suppose). The course
suggests many civilisations rose and fell with changing trade routes.
For instance, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Empire">Khmer
Empire</a> centred on modern day
Cambodia rose on the southward movement of trade between Europe and
China due to climatic changes around 600-1400AD. With the rise of the
Mongols the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_route">Silk
Route</a> re-established itself
and sea based trade diminished along with the fortunes of the Khmer.
However, before this happened Indian stonesmiths and architects brought
their religions and architectural styles to the booming region. Another
example is that statues of Buddha only began to appear once Buddhist
monks traveling along trade routes from India to China encountered the
Hellenistic (and statue producing) societies in central Asia (remnants
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire">Alexander the Great’s
empire</a>). This occurred
centuries after the religion was founded.</p>

<p>The course starts with the beginnings of human society and takes two
weeks before reaching the first towns and cities of the Middle East.
This sets the scene for the nature of the lectures - most time is spent
on art, religion, trade and the way people lived. Then this background
is used to explain the reasons why, how and where certain buildings are
constructed. The mechanics of various religions are particularly
important as most buildings that survive over 1000 years (or were
written about) held some religious significance. There is also regular
discussion of how buildings model certain ideas. The columns of Greek
temples supposedly represent forest groves; the peaks of Hindu temples
model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meru">Mount Meru</a>; the palace
at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis">Persepolis</a> is a giant
meeting ground (like an ancient convention centre). Sometimes this idea
can be quite abstract. Etruscan temples (which along with Greek temples,
influenced the Romans) were supposed to model the movement of birds
flying through the air.</p>

<p>There is also some discussion of how buildings change over time. Many
buildings change usage over time. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon">Parthenon</a> has been a temple,
church, mosque, ruin and tourist site over its 2500 year history. Other
buildings grow in importance and are thus modified. Egyptian temples
grew in power by adding new parts to the building. Churches and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa">stupas</a> generally can’t be
expanded, so instead sites that became more important just built more
churches and stupas.</p>

<p>This is a thought-provoking rush through human history from the first
societies to colonialism. The course presents history via the forces
acting on cultures, unlike the standard tick-tock of historical events.
An interesting perspective and certainly worth a viewing of the
lectures. You also might learn a little about architecture.</p>

<p><em>Sandu Jayasinghe @ 2016-09-10</em> - hey i signed up for the course this year and am kind of nervous about it. I was hoping u to enlighten me on how tough the course and the exams are. as im already a university student and hence won’t have much time to spend on the online course. thanks</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-09-10</em> - Hi, I don’t remember the assessments being particularly hard in this course. There were weekly tests consisting of multiple choice or categorisation questions. They generally took me half the time they were supposed to take. Same with the final exam. The main issue is finding the time to watch the videos and other materials. I remember that being many hours per week. Anyway, all that was over 3 years ago, it may have changed since then. In any case good luck!</p>

<p><em>Sandu Jayasinghe @ 2016-09-11</em> - thanks a lot for the information and for replying. it was helpful</p>
