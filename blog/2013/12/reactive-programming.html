<p>Following on from <a href="/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Functional Programming in
Scala</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> is the more advanced
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">Reactive
Programming</a>. <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive
programming</a> is a style of writing
concurrent event-based asynchronous programs and appears to fit nicely
into Scala’s functional programming model. It is claimed this paradigm
is essential for large scale high performance systems - and my working
experience backs this (although my experience is not with any systems
that describe themselves as “reactive”, instead they were just bespoke
or 3rd party asynchronous event-driven libraries).</p>

<p>Over 7 weeks the course is taught by 3 lecturers: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky">Martin
Odersky</a> (Scala’s creator);
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/headinthebox">Erik Meijer</a>; and,
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/rolandkuhn">Roland Kuhn</a>, lead
developer on the <a href="www.akka.io">Akka</a> reactive library. starting with
some more advanced Scala techniques including the introduction of
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44965/what-is-a-monad">monads</a>, the
course quickly moves onto handling asynchronous computation with
futures, promises and observables. The last three weeks introduce
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actors</a> for concurrency. Each
week there is around an hour or two of video lectures and all but the
last week included a programming assignment (taking a few hours to
complete). Production quality is high.</p>

<p>This course demonstrated both the best and worst parts of online
courses. The well presented material is very interesting and probably
very useful for me professionally. I have downloaded all the lectures so
they can be periodically reviewed and spent some time ensuring I learnt
the concepts. So far, so good - I am happy to have participated.
However, the assignments were another story. Firstly, the assignments
were badly specified. For all but the last week (I guess the organisers
had learnt by then), I had to reread the assignment many times before
even starting. I would usually also have to read the FAQ (why does an
assignment have a separate FAQ!) and check the forums (full of people
similarly confused) for discussions on the gaps in the specification.
The whole thing seemed a little haphazard.</p>

<p>The assignments were also dumbed down. After the first week there were a
number of complaints the assignments were too hard. Hence the due date
for all assignments was extended by a week and a student could submit an
unlimited number of attempts using the best result (instead of the
original maximum of 5 attempts). As a result students no longer needed
to write tests for their code - they could rely on the automatic grader
to test for them (doing so before would likely use too many submissions
before finishing).</p>

<p>I did the course to learn advanced Scala, not to obtain credentials. On
this measure it succeeds. However, MOOC credentials will always be near
worthless if students know that with a little moaning they can have the
course made substantially easier. I imagine the lecturers’ motivation
must be to get as many students through the course as possible. From my
experience, the most popular and most highly completed courses are the
easiest. The only two “difficult” courses I have started (this one and
<a href="/blog/2013/02/introduction-to-astronomy.html">Introduction to
Astronomy</a>), were made
considerably easier after a single week. Dropping coursework to the
lowest common denominator may be great for passing huge numbers of
students, but it won’t do the reputation of these online courses any
good.</p>
