    <p>I want to talk about this blog. Yes, it has been said <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001282.html">Meta Is
Murder</a>, and I
generally agree with that post. However, I originally started this blog
to motivate myself in my personal software development and learn about
internet publishing. This post will be about the latter (in the form of
this blog) and a later post will deal with the former.</p>

<p>Since the first post 20 months ago on February 5th 2008, there have been
71 posts on this blog. An average of 3.5 per month. There has been a
single comment and a single trackback (although there have been many
spam versions of both, but I deleted them). I also set up Google
<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Analytics</a> and
<a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">Adsense</a> to track visits. At first very
few people visited the blog - 20 visitors in the first months, 3 of whom
were me! Since then the number of visitors has slowly increased. As of
midnight yesterday there have been a total of 14,000 unique vistors
resulting in 19,000 page views. The below statistics are for the last
month.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/meta/blogstats.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>The most popular blog posts are the technical ones. Around 55% of the
traffic comes to 3 pages: <a href="/blog/2008/03/installing-sphinx-ultrasphinx.html">Installing Sphinx &amp; Ultrasphinx on
Windows</a>; <a href="/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-">Multiple
Attachments with Validations In Rails with
Paperclip</a> with-vali.html; and, the
<a href="/projects/tooltips.html">Prototype Tooltip Library</a>. The rest of the
top ten are also all technically based. People mainly find these pages
through Google - a full 76% of visitors originate from a Google search.
Note my specification of Google, all other search engines combined
account for 1% of visits.</p>

<p>One month stands out as particularly exceptional. After publishing
<a href="/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-with-vali.html">Multiple Attachments with Validations In Rails with
Paperclip</a> I sent an
email to the <a href="http://railsenvy.com/">Ruby Envy</a> guys and they made a
positive mention of the article (that was a real buzz). The result was
immediate, noticeable and unfortunately short lived. The blog went from
around 40 visits a day to over 300 in a single day. This is the only
promotion of the blog I have done.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/meta/rubyenvy_boost.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>So how much money does advertising on the blog generate? Not much. I
have made a total of £3.09 through 20 clicks on ads. This is a Click
Through Rate of 0.11, which is about right as I’m told one should expect
a rate around 0.1. Last month was the best month ever - making £0.81.
Long may that continue. At that rate I will be able to cash out the
money earned in just under 6 years (minimum balance of £60 before
actually being paid any money).</p>

<p>The short lesson is write technical articles that are easily found
through Google and self-promote.</p>

    <p>I recently listened to a <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/">Software Engineering
Radio</a> podcast on <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2009-08/episode-142-sustainable-architecture-kevlin-henney-and-klaus-marquardt">Sustainable
Architecture</a>.
It was an interesting listen despite much of it being given over to
discussion of well known and generally good software architecture
practices, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling">loosely
coupled</a> design. It also
spent a little too much time on defining software architecture -
everyone defines terms to suit their own needs.</p>

<p>However, the podcast did raise a couple of good points that anecdotally
feel right and I hadn’t heard before. It talked about an option space
when designing software systems. That is, that there are a number of
ways to design and implement a system. Many developers come up with one
way to build a system based on the requirements; then stop designing and
start building. This podcast advises looking at multiple ways to solve
the problem, thus allowing a determination of which parts of the system
will be hard to change or replace at a later date. How costly a decision
is to change should be a major determinant of which direction to take.
The podcast suggests the result will be easier to change in response to
unknown future demands while at the same time not requiring possibly
unnecessary effort in the present (to handle these unknown future
changes). Interesting.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I have been thinking hard about threading in a Java project of
mine, and it definitely requires a great deal of hard thinking. When I
started working with Java there weren’t any native threads, so it was
just easier to make everything single threaded as the performance gain
was minimal. However, as time has passed more and more of my code both
at work and home has needed to work multi-threaded. As I learn more
about Java threading, I realise how wrong I was doing it before - a
cycle repeated a few times in the last 12 years. It was only after
reading the great book <a href="http://jcip.net/">Java Concurrency In Practice</a>
a few years ago that I realised that in Java “locking is not just about
mutual exclusion; it is also about memory visibility.” I can only hope
that this is the last such cycle, but realise it’s probably not.</p>

<p>Talking to other developers there seems to be a standard progression in
Java multi-threaded programming skill:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Just write single threaded programs</li>
  <li>Write multi-threaded programs by marking everything synchronized</li>
  <li>Use wait() and notifyAll() to build up “threadsafe” collection
classes</li>
  <li>Realise your “thread-safe” collection classes aren’t particularly
thread-safe and try using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable domain
objects</a> with
stateless controllers to work around the problem</li>
  <li>Trust in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?">Java API concurrent
utilities</a>
java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html, with its collections,
locks and executors</li>
  <li>Realise that these classes don’t solve all the problems and start
thinking hard about all the issues in your code</li>
  <li>Become very scared about Java threading</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the next step may be using another language that doesn’t allow
shared state. <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/242">Scala uses an Actor
model</a> to asynchronously pass
messages between threads. There is no shared memory so no threading
problems. This sounds like a good way to go, but I still work in Java
for most of my programming (not many Scala or Erlang jobs around!).</p>

<p>This whole situation reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">memory
management</a> in C<span class="underline"></span>. There were simple rules to follow to reduce
memory leakage, but the problem was hard to completely solve (especially
to a newbie programmer) and normally your program still leaked. I
remember leaning heavily on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Purify">Purify</a>. Then Java
came along with its automatic memory management and the problem largely
disappeared. Developers could focus on the business logic of their code
rather than housekeeping. Hopefully a similar thing will happen with
Java threading.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Technical.html">Technical</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>For a recent project I had to connect to two different read-only web
services. Both were from commercial vendors providing very similar
information (which I aggregated). One API was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>
based the other used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>. The REST
interface took me a few hours to write, the SOAP one took days!</p>

<p>For the REST interface I had to send requests to a URL that somewhat
indicated what I was attempting to do - eg
http://example.site/contracts/123 to get the details of contract with id 123. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> was returned and using a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML">SAX</a> parser
constructed my internal objects. In total it took 340 lines of my code
to handle the entire web service. Easy!</p>

<p>Using the SOAP interface required me to download their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language">WSDL</a>
and then construct a model of their domain objects - I used <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/">Apache
Axis2</a> (not Apache Axis though, that is an
old and unmaintained project that does the same thing - a confusion that
cost me some time). Unfortunately the WSDL was wrong and the model
didn’t generate properly. I had to dive into the 2000 line WSDL file to
find and fix the error - and it was near unreadable! Try looking at a
commercial WSDL file some time. After some trial and error the model was
right and when surrounded by copious error handling code it could be
sent and data received from the service. It took 810 lines of my code,
plus hundreds more in the generated model. Urgh. At this point one might
suggest it was just a problem caused by a dodgy service provider.
However, I have since added a third read-only web service to the
project. It is also SOAP based and just as difficult to get running
properly - apart from having to modify the WSDL since theirs was correct
from the start.</p>

<p>I also have experience from the other side, providing a web service.
Using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> I added a REST interface
to my existing website by just providing XML views of the data. While
working at a bank a SOAP interface to an existing legacy system was
required, it took a great deal of fiddling and trust in our IBM
development tools to get it working after a couple of days.</p>

<p>The experience reminds me of an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/29/oreilly_amazon/">interview on The
Register</a> where
Tim O’Reilly suggests that SOAP is a standards first specification
created without reference to how it would be used in the real world
(because at the time the spec was created there weren’t any people using
it). SOAP definitely feels like an overengineered solution. The kind of
thing I would have loved earlier in my career when suffering from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System
Syndrome</a>. Over time
I am becoming increasingly appreciative of simplicity in code.</p>

<p>For me, there is now no comparison. SOAP just doesn’t seem to work well
in any place I’ve seen it tried. My first choice for web service API
will have to be REST.</p>
