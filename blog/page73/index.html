  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I have been thinking hard about threading in a Java project of
mine, and it definitely requires a great deal of hard thinking. When I
started working with Java there weren’t any native threads, so it was
just easier to make everything single threaded as the performance gain
was minimal. However, as time has passed more and more of my code both
at work and home has needed to work multi-threaded. As I learn more
about Java threading, I realise how wrong I was doing it before - a
cycle repeated a few times in the last 12 years. It was only after
reading the great book <a href="http://jcip.net/">Java Concurrency In Practice</a>
a few years ago that I realised that in Java “locking is not just about
mutual exclusion; it is also about memory visibility.” I can only hope
that this is the last such cycle, but realise it’s probably not.</p>

<p>Talking to other developers there seems to be a standard progression in
Java multi-threaded programming skill:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Just write single threaded programs</li>
  <li>Write multi-threaded programs by marking everything synchronized</li>
  <li>Use wait() and notifyAll() to build up “threadsafe” collection
classes</li>
  <li>Realise your “thread-safe” collection classes aren’t particularly
thread-safe and try using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object">immutable domain
objects</a> with
stateless controllers to work around the problem</li>
  <li>Trust in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/index.html?">Java API concurrent
utilities</a>
java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html, with its collections,
locks and executors</li>
  <li>Realise that these classes don’t solve all the problems and start
thinking hard about all the issues in your code</li>
  <li>Become very scared about Java threading</li>
</ol>

<p>I think the next step may be using another language that doesn’t allow
shared state. <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/242">Scala uses an Actor
model</a> to asynchronously pass
messages between threads. There is no shared memory so no threading
problems. This sounds like a good way to go, but I still work in Java
for most of my programming (not many Scala or Erlang jobs around!).</p>

<p>This whole situation reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_management">memory
management</a> in C<span class="underline"></span>. There were simple rules to follow to reduce
memory leakage, but the problem was hard to completely solve (especially
to a newbie programmer) and normally your program still leaked. I
remember leaning heavily on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Purify">Purify</a>. Then Java
came along with its automatic memory management and the problem largely
disappeared. Developers could focus on the business logic of their code
rather than housekeeping. Hopefully a similar thing will happen with
Java threading.</p>

it is time to try another historical model (my first was <a href="/blender/tutorials/tozeur_sculpture/index.html">a sculpture in

  <div class="content">
    <p>For a recent project I had to connect to two different read-only web
services. Both were from commercial vendors providing very similar
information (which I aggregated). One API was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>
based the other used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>. The REST
interface took me a few hours to write, the SOAP one took days!</p>

<p>For the REST interface I had to send requests to a URL that somewhat
indicated what I was attempting to do - eg
http://example.site/contracts/123 to get the details of contract with id 123. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> was returned and using a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML">SAX</a> parser
constructed my internal objects. In total it took 340 lines of my code
to handle the entire web service. Easy!</p>

<p>Using the SOAP interface required me to download their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language">WSDL</a>
and then construct a model of their domain objects - I used <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/">Apache
Axis2</a> (not Apache Axis though, that is an
old and unmaintained project that does the same thing - a confusion that
cost me some time). Unfortunately the WSDL was wrong and the model
didn’t generate properly. I had to dive into the 2000 line WSDL file to
find and fix the error - and it was near unreadable! Try looking at a
commercial WSDL file some time. After some trial and error the model was
right and when surrounded by copious error handling code it could be
sent and data received from the service. It took 810 lines of my code,
plus hundreds more in the generated model. Urgh. At this point one might
suggest it was just a problem caused by a dodgy service provider.
However, I have since added a third read-only web service to the
project. It is also SOAP based and just as difficult to get running
properly - apart from having to modify the WSDL since theirs was correct
from the start.</p>

<p>I also have experience from the other side, providing a web service.
Using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> I added a REST interface
to my existing website by just providing XML views of the data. While
working at a bank a SOAP interface to an existing legacy system was
required, it took a great deal of fiddling and trust in our IBM
development tools to get it working after a couple of days.</p>

<p>The experience reminds me of an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/29/oreilly_amazon/">interview on The
Register</a> where
Tim O’Reilly suggests that SOAP is a standards first specification
created without reference to how it would be used in the real world
(because at the time the spec was created there weren’t any people using
it). SOAP definitely feels like an overengineered solution. The kind of
thing I would have loved earlier in my career when suffering from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System
Syndrome</a>. Over time
I am becoming increasingly appreciative of simplicity in code.</p>

<p>For me, there is now no comparison. SOAP just doesn’t seem to work well
in any place I’ve seen it tried. My first choice for web service API
will have to be REST.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>This week I met up with some old colleagues. While talking about what we
were all doing now, one person who still worked at the place we worked
together mentioned that there had been a change in software
architecture. Thus all my old code would be rewritten. This news got me
thinking. I’ve been writing software commercially for nearly 12 years
and most of my code is no longer used. Three years of work is gone due
to my employers going bust. Another 3 and a half years worth was (or
will be) rewritten after changes in platform architecture. Two more
years of work was retired after completing the purpose for which it was
written. One employer from years ago still uses 2 years of coding work -
just last month I crossed paths with one of the users who did acceptance
testing (he remembered me after 5 years, although neither of us could
remember the other’s name) and he said they were still very happy with
it. So about 70% of my work, measured by time, is gone and no longer of
any use. Is that normal?</p>

<p>I’m not sure what is the appropriate comparison. Engineers and
architects build structures that last for many years. I have known
people who assisted building houses, power stations, and gas pumping
stations. All of which still stand and should for decades to come.
However, these are physical things, so are obviously physically harder
to construct. Creating software is a thought driven logical process.
Perhaps a better comparison is with other professionals dealing with
abstract concepts like accountants, lawyers, analysts, etc. Much of
their output is transactional in nature: calculating this year’s
corporate accounts; writing or checking a contract; or, producing a
report. While such work may exist for some time, its utility drops
greatly once the reason for its creation has passed. I suppose this is
analogous to code still existing in sourcecode repositories long after
it no longer runs. In which case still having 30% of my work useful is
probably a good record.</p>

<p>However, I don’t find the comparison to other abstract workers wholly
compelling. Software developers seem to fall in between them and
engineers. We think abstractly for a living, but produce something, even
if it is just logic, that has utility beyond the point of its creation.
Some computer programs have been running for decades - otherwise there
couldn’t have been such an issue around
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K</a>. Even in the
faster moving consumer software world code can hang around. Just today I
used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a> command window - probably
some very old code hanging around there.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to think about my profession is that it is a
discipline of engineering which works with logic and thus allows the
perception that its artefacts are easily replaced (even if in reality
that often is not the case). Also it is a fairly new profession and as
such it is developing and changing rapidly, which also encourages code
to be replaced with updated, more modern, versions. As for my record,
when I mentioned the figures to my old colleagues they didn’t think it
was strange or exceptional in any way. That is probably just modern
commercial software development.</p>

    <p>I was recently listening to a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/audio/2009/jul/21/tech-weekly-podcast-develop-video-games-eidos-braben">podcast from a game developers
conference</a>,
and there was a great deal of conversation around open world games like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)">GTA</a>. That
discussion made me think about the difference between a storyline (be it
from a book, movie or game) and the world in which it’s set. When a
story is set somewhere other than the familiar every day world, the
perceived richness of that world can make a big difference to
satisfaction in the story. Think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of the
Rings</a>, where there
is a strong impression that there is history to Middle-earth (read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion">The
Silmarillion</a> to see that
is exactly the case) and many interesting things are occurring just out
of reach of the plot.</p>

<p>The first two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(series)">Matrix</a>
movies are another example. The first Matrix movie was quite linear (as
many prophecy movies tend to be). Neo was led from scene to scene to
fulfil his destiny. The world around Neo was the same as our own except
for two organised opposing groups who knew the secret of the matrix.
There wasn’t much room for manoeuvre. Despite what people thought of the
second Matrix’s plot, its world was far richer. Neo has some choice in
his actions, there are portals or otherwise strange locations and rogue
or independent programs roaming the matrix. It is no longer black versus
white, there are many other actors on the stage.</p>

<p>When I used to run D&amp;D games some advice I was given was to make the
world seem as open as possible, even if you were trying to subtly guide
the players in one direction. The story can be thought of as a train,
starting at the caboose and ending at the engine. A linear story/game
would have the protagonists/players just travel through each carriage in
turn. In a more open environment they may travel by climbing over the
carriage roof or skipping carriages by walking past them at a station or
travel backwards for a bit. In a completely open environment they could
decide not to go to the engine at all, leave the train and do something
else. A world in which that last option appears possible and realistic
is much more interesting, even if the actual story is linear.</p>
