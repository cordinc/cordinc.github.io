    <p><strong>Possible Spoilers Below</strong></p>

<p>Last night I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurt_Locker">Hurt
Locker</a> for the first
time. I was looking forward to it. I had heard so many reviews and it
had won 6 Oscars. However, to put it politely, I didn’t like it. I
consider it well below average. Both the major and minor characters are
unbelievable and fit neatly into standard movie stereotypes (“he’s a
maverick, doing dangerous things - but he gets results!”). The scenarios
in which the characters find themselves seem unlikely. One character
carjacks a local and travels across Baghdad, then runs back to the base.
At another point, 3 characters search for enemy bombers in the
backstreets by themselves and unknown to their support. Coming to a
three-way junction, they split up! The script is often heavy-handed,
letting the audience know exactly what they are supposed to be thinking.
For instance, when confronted with a possibly involuntary suicide
bomber, the interpreter repeatedly reminds us “he’s a good guy”. Once is
required, maybe twice to stress the point. However, the many repetitions
beyond that are just clunky. At once crucial point we are told “he has 4
children”. Are we perhaps supposed to empathise with him?</p>

<p>The plot is quite episodic. This got me thinking. It might be that the
story’s ambition was neutered by making it a movie in the first place.
The story has potential and maybe many of its problems (heavy
handedness, stock characters) could be solved by taking longer to tell
it - much longer. It is very hard to fit a complete interesting story
with detailed real characters into the 2 hour timeframe of a film. I
doubt even extending the running length to 3 hours, the extreme end of
theatrical releases, would give enough room to properly tell Hurt
Locker’s story. Perhaps it should be a TV series.</p>

<p>I remember a time not long ago when the 4 or 6 hours of a mini-series
were the longest storylines around. Now there have been quite a few TV
series with continuous storylines. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Babylon 5</a> was the first I remember, but
since then there have been the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire">The
Wire</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos">The
Sopranos</a> among many others.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Kill">Generation Kill</a> told a
similar story to Hurt Locker more successfully over 7 hours. After
watching these, other TV shows with their “everything resolved in 40
minutes” episodes seem inferior (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Dr
Who</a> is suffering from this at
the moment). I am not suggesting film is inferior in general, just that
it has its limits and most of the best films don’t try to do too much.
For great characters and great stories the extra time afforded by TV
pays great dividends.</p>

    <p>Having crated a basic low-poly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha">mecha</a> model in <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/1_model/index.html">a previous
tutorial</a>,
it is now time to liven up the model by texturing it. The application of
materials and textures is the hardest part of modelling for me, and I’m
not entirely happy with the result. My artistic abilities need some
work. However, the general technique is still worth noting. The tutorial
will show how the mech model was made to look as below. Later tutorials
will show how to rig the model and animate a walk cycle.</p>

    <p>I decided to move away from historical models for this tutorial. I chose
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha">mecha</a>, a walking robot, as an
exercise in texturing, rigging and animation. The idea is to first
create a low-poly model so that most of the visual detail is in the
textures applied. Then a walk cycle will be animated using bone rigging
to aid further animations. The result will be the sort of model that
could be used in a simple game. As there are quite a few steps in
achieving all of this, the tutorial has been split into four parts. This
first part creates the base model. Following posts will cover texturing,
rigging and animating.</p>

Podcasts</a></p>

<p>‘Buildings of Ancient Rome’ is another of the consistently good <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open
University</a> short podcasts. This one describes
and details the histories of certain buildings (mainly temples) of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Ancient Rome</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Flaminius">Circus
Flaminus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largo_di_Torre_Argentina">Largo
Argentina</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum">Roman Forum</a>. Thus it focuses
on a few quite small (and, apart from the Forum, less well-known) areas
of ancient Roman ruins. The format is a series of 5 short video
documentaries (although iTunes only lists 4 videos on its iPod page, it
then lists all 5 on the Mac/PC page). The videos are available in a
640x360 format or a smaller iPod optimised format. They range from 2
minutes to 15 minutes in length, and transcripts are also available.</p>

<p>The videos are made entirely of pictures of the temples/buildings being
discussed in their current state (with the very occasional floor plan).
The audio comprises details of the buildings and their history. There
are no reconstructions or interviews. The information comes think and
fast - dates of construction (and sometimes destruction), architectural
notes, interesting events in their history and how it is thought they
were used. It can be hard to orientate yourself - a little knowledge of
Rome’s history and layout helps immensely. Interesting, but not
introductory.</p>

    <p>The last few days before the UK election saw the image below circulating
around the city. I saw it first on <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com">FT
Alphaville</a>. I find this image incredibly
annoying. Not because the message is necessarily wrong. There is a
strong case to be made that the Labour’s party’s rhetoric on their
ability to manage the UK economy is in no way matched by their actual
management of the economy (although it’s debatable whether the Tories
would have been any better). Instead, it is because the image is using a
misunderstood part of the financial world to produce a misleading graph.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/boom-to-bust.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/boom-to-bust.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The image is a graph of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index">FTSE
100</a> stock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_index">market
index</a> of the largest
companies listed on the <a href="www.londonstockexchange.com/">London Stock Exchange
(LSE)</a>. It is a UK version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500">S&amp;P
500</a>. Like other share indexes
it is often quoted on the news in absolute terms as well as the absolute
rise or drop over some time period. For example yesterday the FTSE 100
closed at 5123, a drop of 138 points. However, to compare movements the
absolute point value should not be used. This is because the index is
calculated as the change relative to some reference date. Calculated
from this base, the larger the index, the larger point move required to
be equivalent to a move at a smaller index move. A 2% move when the
index is at 5000 is 100 points, when the index is at 2000 an equivalent
move is 40 points. As the index gets larger, point movements will
naturally become larger for no difference in activity. Thus the graph
above is misleading because it exaggerates the more recent point moves
at a larger index level compared to the earlier moves.</p>

<p>It is the percentage move that is important. If the graph showed
percentage moves the 1987 crash would appear much larger and the recent
crashes smaller. To better show the relative moves, I found a graph of
the <a href="http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=^FTSE#chart3:symbol=^ftse;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">FTSE using a logarithmic scale on
Yahoo</a>.
As can be seen below the recent boom and bust don’t seem as large, but
they are still there. So the same message could have been sent with a
less misleading graph.</p>
