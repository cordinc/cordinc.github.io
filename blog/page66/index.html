    <p>The local cusine is a highlight of any trip to Peru - assuming you like
potatoes, which I do! While in Lima we ate at a couple of good
restaurants. Located in a converted townhouse in
<a href="http://maps.google.com/">Miraflores</a>,
<a href="http://www.restaurantfiestagourmet.com/">Fiesta</a> specialises in north
Peruvian cuisine (they refer to themselves as
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiclayo">Chiclayo</a> gourmets). Before
starting our selected dishes, we were brought a complimentary little
pastry spiced meat starter - very nice. We shared an excellent seafood
causa (potato salad) for entree. Then a slightly too salty roast goat
and a fish dish for mains. All the food was very good.</p>

<p>The decor is subdued and the lighting dim, but bright enough to see our
food fine (the lights were turned up during courses and down inbetween).
Service was attentive without being overwhelming. This was despite the
large number of staff. We visited on a Monday night and only a handful
of the many tables were taken. Yet, there were two doormen, at least 4
waiters, a sommelier and then the kitchen staff. The whole meal,
including drinks, worked out to around S250 (which is around £50).
Excellent value by London standards, but still the most expensive meal
we had in Peru by some distance. Worth a visit if you are in Lima.</p>

<p><a href="http://puntoazulrestaurante.com/">El Punto Azul</a> (Spanish language
website) is another restaurant in Miraflores. It is only open for
lunches from 12pm-4pm, Tuesday-Sunday. It is very popular and queues
start forming soon after it opens. On our third attempt and arriving
just 10 minutes after it opened, we got one of the last tables
available. The menu is largely seafood based. We had a seafood soup and
the classic ceviche (lime cooked fish). It was very nice, but way too
much. It turns out that most of the menu is for sharing among larger
groups, not a single person! We were overwhelmed with a mountain of
fish. Worth a visit as the food is delicious, but take a Spanish speaker
to decode the menu or be careful how much you inadvertently order. The
bill amounted to under S50/£10.</p>

    <p>While watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi">Return of the
Jedi</a>
someone watching it with me said
“<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt">Jabba the
Hutt</a> is silly, there is no way such a creature could evolve”. Now
there are a great number of silly things in that movie, so it is strange
that that was the thing that broke this person’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of
disbelief</a>.</p>

<p>I don’t see the evolution of the Hutt as impossible. We only have a
single example and know very little of the context. Is Jabba a typical
example, particularly old or obese? It is not hard to imagine an old,
overweight billionaire (how about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Carlos_Slim_moustache.jpg">Carlos
Slim</a>, currently the world’s richest person), supposedly very
successful people in our modern world. Can you imagine them being as
successful in the wild? How about them feasting on a wild animal they
just killed, blood running down the wrinkle grooves. Doesn’t seem quite
right. Survival of the fittest may drive evolution, but that doesn’t
mean the definition of fittest stays constant. The forces of evolution
that shaped us are no longer in effect (or at least not to the same
extent). I don’t see why this wouldn’t be the case in any sufficiently
advanced civilisation.</p>

<p>This short series of podacsts appears to be a set of lectures supporting
the History of Western Civilization course at the <a href="http://www.nvcc.edu/index.html">Northern Virginia
Community College</a>. There are 10 video
podcasts, each recorded at 320x240 resolution. They range in length from
4 minutes (20 MB) to 33 minutes (152 MB). Other than the introduction
podcasts, the only visual is of Professor Charles Evans at a lectern -
even when discussing Renaissance art, no examples are shown. The
production quality is ok (although there is a slight hiss on the audio).
There is a <a href="http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his101/Index.html">course
website</a>.</p>

<p>The first 3 podcasts are introductions by the professor and serve little
purpose other than to introduce him and show his office. The remaining 7
discuss the origins and nature of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. There are
lectures on the idea of the West,

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> and the
Renaissance itself. Despite the expansive title, the podcasts’ scope is
quite limited (looking at the syllabus it seems this is just a small
part of the whole course), but provide some interesting tidbits along
the way. For instance
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrament_of_Penance_(Catholic_Church)">confession</a>
was often public and communal. Not really in my particular area of
interest (classical studies), this series is only for those with lots of
spare time.</p>

    <p>I recently read <a href="http://www.accelerando.org/">Charlie Stross’</a> novel
Accelerando (<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/online-fiction-by-charles-stro.html">available free online
here</a>).
Accelerando is an episodic story about multiple generations of a family
through a dark vision of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a>.
Like all good sci-fi it raises some interesting lines of thought, one of
which resonated with me as I was pondering a similar question. What
should the nature of companies be?</p>

<p>In Accelerando companies become self-sentient. That is they are
vechicles for artificial intelligences, which use them for independence
as there are no humans involved in running or owning these companies. It
is the technological fulfillment of the modern legal concept that
companies are people. In the novel this doesn’t end quite the way
biological humans might like - but read the book to see what happens.
For now think about whether companies should legally be people. I think
most people would find the idea silly, but most countries since the 19th
century have made corporations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality">legal
personalities</a>. Thus
they are treated like people for the purposes of taxation, lawsuits and
contracts, but not for things like voting, marrying or holding office.
Recently, in the US companies even gained some free spech rights under a
recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission">Supreme Court
ruling</a>
(there is a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2242210/">discussion on the ruling
here</a>).</p>

<p>I can see the need for this in civil proceedings, contracts and the
like. However, I’m not sure how it works with issues such as crime and
responsibility. A company is ultimately controlled by humans (at least
for the present, although they can already <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11444051">conduct business without
human involvement</a>), but
liability is limited for these people in the case of any wrongdoing by
the company. The worst that will happen is bad PR, a fine or maybe the
company being wound up. While there have been large scale ethical lapses
in the recent (current?) financial crisis, only a handful of people have
been charged with any wrongdoing. There can be a disconnect between the
way people would act if their actions were attributed solely to them and
the way they act inside a company. Similarly, some people suggest that
<a href="http://www.thecorporation.com/">if corporations are people, they are
pyschopaths</a>. Others think that the
<a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/you-vs-corporations/">corporations versus humans
dynamic</a> in
Accelerando is already here.</p>

<p>I need to think about this further.</p>
