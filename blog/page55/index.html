    <p>After joining Knowledge-based Systems at Rio Tinto R&amp;TD, my first task
was working on the MineSim project. This was a very successful
application to simulate minesites. To do this a user would define the
topology/geology of a mine, the equipment/personnel available and the
goals to pursue. The program would then simulate the mine minute by
minute. New blocks would be blown when ready, little loaders would muck
out the ore from the block and large trucks moved round the mine,
picking up ore and driving back to the dumps.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/electrolley.html">Electrolley</a> I
worked at <a href="http://www.riotinto.com/">Rio Tinto</a> in their Research and
Technical Development division. I had wanted a job there for sometime.
Many of my honours classmates and one of my ex-lecturers (the one I
originally wanted as my honours supervisor) worked there. I had
interviewed with them during my PhD, but was rejected as the position
was for a more practical programmer and they saw me as too theoretical.
After a few months at Electolley I was contacted saying a position more
suited for my skills had arisen and asking if was I still interested.
Soon I was being interviewed again.</p>

<p>The interview process was the most arduous I’ve ever encountered. First
there was an interview by a couple of managers. Then another interview
by the entire team I would be joining. A panel of nine people arrayed in
front on me. During this part they asked me to give an impromptu 15
minute presentation of my ex-PhD topic. A quizzing on its practical
applicability followed. By this stage I have been onsite two hours and
they said it was time for the next stage. I was taxied into the city and
given a battery of psychometric tests. There was a logical reasoning
test (well-above average), vocabulary test (average), Myers-Briggs test
(INTP, as always) and another test I’d never heard of before to check my
work aptitude. Nearly 5 hours in total and I was completely drained.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/Rio-Tinto-logo-main.jpg" alt="Rio Logo" title="Rio Logo" /></p>

<p>I got the job and after a few months I heard that it didn’t really
matter what the tests said. Half the team (including the manager) knew
me from uni or honours, so unless I had a breakdown the job was always
mine. To prove the point I was told the results of the psychometric
tests. Apparently the unknown test had indicated I was completely
unemployable and unable to work in a team. They ignored it and hired me
anyway.</p>

<p>The Rio Tinto R&amp;TD team in Perth was in beautiful purpose built building
near Curtin University. It was designed to be like a village - a central
street walkway acting as a street with trees and benches (all inside).
Off the walkway came the open plan office space. There was also a large
reception, board room, library, large eating area and kitchen. No
canteen, but I never heard of anyone in Perth having a canteen. It was
set on landscaped grounds with more than enough parking and there was
tons of natural light. A very pleasant workspace. The only problem was
the abandoned building and the emptiness.</p>

<p>The complex was built to house over 300 staff, but never housed more
than 55 people while I was there. There was another entire building with
workshops unused and locked up. Most of my colleagues spread themselves
out over 2 desks. A couple of months before I started there was over 200
people on site. Most desks were taken and the workshops full of
engineers. However, many were made redundant or transferred around the
time of my interview. Four small teams were left (plus admin staff).</p>

<p>I was in Knowledge-Based Systems. We were supposed to focus on applying
machine learning techniques (like expert systems) to mining problems.
Although most of our time was spent writing mine simulations, linear
optimisation systems (basically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm">simplex
method</a> with a large
number of variables and a nice GUI) or training tools. There was another
team of more “practical” software developers working with early web
technologies. On the non-computer side was a team of mathematicians and
engineers doing various consulting tasks and a small team focused on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics">Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD)</a> in
smelters.</p>

<p>With just 1st class Honours I was clearly one of the least educated
people in the building. Their was a distinct academic bias. Most of the
senior managers had PhDs, as did probably a third of the staff. People
generally had time to think - although that may not have been a good
indicator for future prospects. There were often discussions of very
scientific topics and opinions were always well informed. Here I learnt
the more theoretical side of software engineering with regular arguments
on what process or pattern was best in a certain situation. Later I
learnt the more practical side.</p>

<p>While I was there the place had an eerie atmosphere. All non-managers
openly believed that we would all be made redundant sooner rather than
later. Everyone knew the intimate details of the redundancy policy. It
was very generous so staff turnover was low as people waited for their
inevitable payout. I remember hearing a couple of anonymous shouts of
“make me redundant now!”. There was a bit of black humour around the
situation. When the head of the global technology division changed we
joked about him being an evil leprechaun (he had an unfortunate staff
photo) who would sack us all. We were right!</p>

<p>The site was also extremely safe. All sites in Rio Tinto apparently
followed the same safety precautions. Thus our research office building
took safety as seriously as a mine site. There was a sign at the
entrance proudly displaying there there had been no lost time due to
injury for over 600 days (not sure the actual number, but it was years).
Towards the end of my time there the counter reset after a morning was
lost when a minor traffic accident resulted in a checkup at the doctors
(they were fine). We had a safety manager who trained us all on the
safety precautions. Every month he would tour the site for safety
violations and hand out cautions - normally for overly large stacks of
paper or dirty mugs. I felt a little sorry for the guy, there wasn’t
much for him to do. He previously had a similar job at a mine, which
must have been much more interesting. Although it was impressive how
after I casually mentioned my fingers ached a little one day to see how
serious it was taken. I was visited by an outside ergonomics expert who
recommended my desk be lowered a few centimeters. That afternoon it was
dismantled and rebuilt! The expert was right, the new desk was much
better.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/rio_mug.png" alt="My Rio Mug" title="My Rio Mug" /></p>

<p>I sat with two colleagues is a small area of desks partitioned off
between a reception desk and the General Manager’s office. The area was
partitioned into thirds, each section with 2 desks, 2 PCs, etc. We took
one section each. It was a good little spot. The partitions went up to
eye level, and there was only one place to enter the area. The
partitions were also setup such that to reach the back thirds a visitor
would need to make a couple of 90 degree turns. Furthermore large pot
plants had been placed at strategic points to block sightlines into the
area. The basic affect was that we could tell when someone was coming
towards us, but they couldn’t see what we were doing. Knowing the person
who sat furthest from the entrance (an aspiring DJ), I don’t think this
setup was unintentional. For the same reason none of the three of us
could see eachothers’ screens. I had two PCs, but only ever used one, a
decent second hand computer (from someone recently made redundant -
Pentium2 with a 17” CRT, good for the late 90’s). One of the other guys
had 2 PCs and bright blue <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_Indigo">Silicon Graphics
Indigo</a> machine for a 3D
modelling project he did - very cool.</p>

<p>As a small office in a global company we traveled often to various
mining sites around the world. I only went once, to an Australian gold
mine, which I will write about later. Others went around the world. The
one place I would have like to have visited was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasberg_mine">Grasberg mine in
Indonesia</a> - a very large
gold and copper mine up a tropical mountain. There was some talk of
sending me there to run a training course, but I didn’t act keen and the
timing wasn’t good with my other projects. In retrospect I should have
volunteered.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua_(province)">Irian
Jaya</a> is a place that most foreigners (or even Indonesians) do not
get a chance to visit. There were always good stories about visits.
During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis">Asian financial crisis in
1997</a> one
colleague visiting there managed to run up an enormous 5 digit expenses
bill - he occasionally told snippets of the story of his few days living
the high life. Management were aghast, but I had the sense they were
slightly impressed with the ability to spend so much when the local
currency was so cheap.</p>

<p>Soon after I declined the trip to Grasberg one of our staff visiting the
mine was threatened with a spear when some locals bust into the onsite
offices. I think it turned out to be a dispute over a pig, but
management was greatly concerned as there is a low-level insurgency in
the area (over independence from Indonesia). No one from our office ever
went there again.</p>

<p>Working at R&amp;TD was fairly pleasant on a day-to-day basis. It was small
enough for us all know eachother, and there was a slight siege mentality - us versus the off-site management wanting to shut us down. Everyone
got a mug with their name (or nickname) printed on it when they started
work. This stopped the problem everywhere else about disappearing
mugs/cups. I still have mine 12 years later. When an eclipse occurred we
all headed outside for the afternoon to see it. There was a social
committee which arranged various regular small events. I was actually a
member or the committee for a while. I arranged the Christmas Party
river cruise right before I left. In fact I didn’t go to the party I
organised, it didn’t seem right as I quit and left a few weeks before
the event.</p>

<p>I also tried to get involved in the company superannuation/pension plan.
They had elections for staff representatives on the plan’s board. I
thought it would look good on my resume. Most of the people I worked
with acted bemused when told I was running. My campaign was fairly weak,
consisting mainly of writing a blurb for the company magazine (As did
all the other candidates). In the end I think I got about 20 votes, not
even half the people I worked with. The winners got thousands of votes.</p>

<p>After I had been at Rio just over a year, the work starting slowing,
senior management swapped jobs and a review was announced. It seemed
like the end was nigh. I knew the redundancy policy very well (as did
everyone) and until I had been there over two years I would receive very
little. It seemed unlikely I would make it that far or be promoted. It
is best to jump than be pushed so I looked around. Finding a job in the
dotcom boom was not too hard, and I left after 18 months at Rio. A few
months later all but a handful of my ex-colleagues were sacked and the
facility shuttered. My timing was just right.</p>

<p>My last memories of working at Rio were having competitions with the
aspiring DJ next to me over who could leave earliest. He won by leaving
at 3pm, walking past the General Managers office and saying goodbye
before walking out. I didn’t have the balls to top that even though I
had quit. On my last day we all went to the pub for lunch. I left about
4pm, my manager and most of his team were still there (and stayed late
into the night). He teased me for leaving “early”.</p>

</ul>

<p>So after nearly 7 years on EGB technology teams I have moved on. Not out
of banking (at least not yet), but when the opportunity came to try a
different business area I jumped. This is despite being able to earn
more money if I stayed in my EGB niche. There are two related reasons
for leaving: the industry and technology are both changing to the
detriment of developers.</p>

<p>When I started in 2005, EGB trading was already on an upswing that
lasted through 2009. I’m not sure when this upwards trajectory began,
but the people around me considered it normal. Business was good
throughout the mortgage and banking crisis of 2008. When times are good
and the desks are making good money some of it is reinvested into
technology. There was a lot of optimism and this translated into banks
wanting the fastest and smartest trading platform. We got to rewrite
systems. Increasingly business was relying on technology - it was
becoming trade-by-wire. It seemed that there was much further to go.
Algorithmic trading is big in equities, why couldn’t it be big in fixed
income too. There was huge potential for writing interesting code.</p>

<p>This environment no longer exists. It was only when the European debt
crisis began to bite in 2011 that things trended downwards, but then
they went down fast. There is a great deal less ambition among the fixed
income desks. Most traders seem happy just to not be losing money -
something many are not achieving. Some banks are shutting down their
bonds desks. As a natural consequence there is less to spend on
technology and little desire to do more than maintenance. Flow volume is
king, and as far as technology development is concerned, that is not
hard. Thus less developers are required and the work is less
interesting.</p>

<p>Combined with this is the creeping commoditisation of bonds technology.
When I started ION provided mainly gateways, little tools and their
message bus. Over time they have climbed up the product stack. Now they
also sell pricing engines, autoquoters, autohedgers, risk engines,
position servers - nearly everything a bank needs to trade cash bonds.
The quality is fine too. Their applications won’t do everything a desk
requires, but it will do most of it and the desk’s technology team can
add the remainder quickly. Not all banks will use vendor systems (many
don’t like Ion or see advantage in bespoke systems), but enough will to
affect the market for EGB technologists.</p>

<p>Thus, once again, less developers are required and the work is less
interesting. I don’t see the situation changing until the market
improves - and I don’t see that happening soon. So I thought it time to
try a different business area.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Goals.html">Goals</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Just 12 months ago I said I hoped to achieve the below by the start of
this year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Result:
achieved.</strong> - 48 posts in 12 months, so this target was easily
surpassed.</li>
  <li><strong>Only have 2 programming projects going at the same time. Result:
achieved.</strong> - I did this to the letter of the goal, but there were a
couple of abandoned projects along the way. On the plus side, I did
a couple of successful little projects to teach myself game coding
(see <a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/">my blender page</a>) and now I’m
working on a larger game demo to test out some ideas.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete 2 Blender models. Result: partial.</strong> - I did two, a
<a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/lamp">Roman lamp</a> and a
<a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/spaceship/index.html">spaceship</a>.
However, I originally planned to do two completely different (more
complex) models. This difference occurred as I needed to learn the
new Blender 2.5 interface, and then wanted to focus on game models
rather than historical models.</li>
  <li><strong>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: maybe.</strong> - I
bought a new computer and it is quite large. Apart from that I have
less, but when included it is about even.</li>
  <li><strong>Run 5km in 27 minutes. Result: not even close.</strong> - My foot problem
has not abated all year. A few abortive runs midyear quickly led to
a reoccurrence of the injury and further rest. Only now do I seem to
be back to normal - but I’m yet to properly test it.</li>
  <li><strong>Work less, travel more. Result: achieved.</strong> -
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/11/north-cornwall.html">Cornwall</a>,
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/10/turkey.html">Turkey</a>,
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/04/andalusia.html">Andalusia</a>,
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/02/tenerife.html">Tenerife</a>, plus
some other little holidays.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain general Ruby and Scala skills. Result: partial.</strong> - I’ve
done some Ruby, but no Scala.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the coming year I have decreased the number of goals, mainly because
there are a few big ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Never more than
4 a month. Historically this shouldn’t be a problem, but I also
don’t want it to become a time sink.</li>
  <li>Complete the game demo and send it out for comments. If the feedback
is not disastrous start working on a full game. This is my main goal
now. I’d also like to do one other project over the year (probably a
simple website).</li>
  <li>Be able to run. I just want my foot to be completely better so and I
can run without concern, speed is not important.</li>
  <li>Decrease net ownership of physical goods, as always but especially
relevant considering the next goal.</li>
  <li>Leave the UK. Recent events mean this will probably be my last year
in the UK. It took months to organise my move here. I expect a
similar effort this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus as a nice to do, if I have time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain general Blender, Ruby and Scala skills - same as last year.</li>
</ul>
