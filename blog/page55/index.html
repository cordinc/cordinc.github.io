    <p>For a game idea I needed a model of a spaceship. Having learnt from
previous tutorials, the main goal of this tutorial is to properly
texture a simple model for game engines. Instead of having multiple
materials for the mesh and textures applied to just a few faces, there
should be a single material for the entire mesh and textures should be
images applied to all the faces. Also normal maps should not be black
and white, but a special colour scheme. Thus setting up UV mappings and
proper normal maps is critical.</p>

<p><a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/spaceship/index.html">The continuation of this post is a set by step tutorial detailing my
methodology</a>.</p>

<p>This podcast is a single 41 minute (16.6MB) audio-only interview. In it
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Ward-Perkins">Bryan Ward-Perkins</a> of
the <a href="http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford University History Department</a>
answers questions about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decline_of_the_Roman_Empire">fall of
Rome</a>. He has
written a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Fall-Rome-End-Civilization/dp/0192807285/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1313173173&amp;sr=8-1">book on the same
topic</a>.
The podcast is well produced.</p>

<p>Bryan Ward-Perkins contends that the Western Roman empire “fell” rather
than declined, and that the transition was quite nasty for the
previously Roman people. This is despite the newcomers (mainly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germanic_peoples">Germanic</a> tribes) often
trying to imitate Roman culture. The fall occurred over different
timespans in different parts of the empire. In Britain the collapse was
very fast and deep, while in Italy it took a couple of centuries for
complex society to fade away. After this time it is hard to tell what is
happening in Western Europe (hence the name
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_(historiography)">Dark
Ages</a>). This is not only because there is a paucity of literary works
from this time, but also less archaeological evidence. People owned
fewer things and new stone buildings were rarer. The use of small coins
declined as trade diminished and anything other than the local market
disappeared. For instance, in Britain producing pottery seems to have
gone from a specialised profession to something done ad hoc by the
people who needed it (rather than buy pottery from a market). Society
became less connected and complex as the middle and lower classes
dissolved into either the few extremely rich people or the vast poor
peasants.</p>

    <p>What is your earliest memory? Are you sure?</p>

<p>I always thought my earliest memory was laying on a folding bed and
feeling the ground shake, so I ran outside to the garden next to a large
rock. This was in Australia, but wasn’t the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/01/life-on-a-building-site.html">house in
Leeming</a>
we moved to sometime in 1979 (because I know we were there by the time I
started school). Thus it must have occurred sometime in 1978 or 1979. I
always assumed it was 1978. However, using the power of the Internet, I
looked it up. Here is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquakes_in_Western_Australia">list of the earthquakes of note in Western
Australia</a>.
Not many and only one of around the right time. The <a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/25962/20040718-0000/www.seismicity.segs.uwa.edu.au/seismicity_of_western_australia/wa_historical/cadoux.html">Cadoux
earthquake</a>
was at 9:48 on the morning of 2 June 1979 and was strong enough to be
felt in Perth, 180km away. This seems way too late, I thought we had
moved to Leeming by then. I couldn’t find when the Leeming house was
built, but we were definitely living there by 1980 as that was when I
started primary school at
<a href="http://www.oberthurps.det.wa.edu.au/">Oberthur</a> and I have a few
memories of that time. I also went to pre-primary at Oberthur while in
Leeming, but I don’t know for how long.</p>

<p>So is the memory correct? I know there was an earthquake, but was it at
the same time as the folding bed and rock? It is possible the memory is
accurate. If I did less than 6 months pre-primary, it could have been
just before we moved to Leeming. Or maybe I’m conflating two different
memories. The memory is more vivid than others from around the same
time: visiting our house in Leeming when it was being built; hearing
that the class mouse had died in pre-primary; and, seeing the changing
light display on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Brewery">Old Swan
Brewery</a> as part of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAY_%2779">Perth Sesquicentennial</a>. Those
memories are more static, like they are really memories of a photo (but
as far as I know there are no photos of these events). Perhaps they are
memories of memories. The rock/earthquake memory has movement and
context. There also exists a photo of me next to the rock from around
that time. Maybe a long time ago the memories of various things got
merged. I’m not sure anymore.</p>

or the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/">BBC website</a> or the
<a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/system_pages/holding_area/explore/a_history_of_the_world.aspx">British Museum
website</a>.</p>

<p>Originally broadcast on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/">BBC radio</a>, A
History of the World in 100 Objects is an epic series attempting to
describe all human history via the stories of a 100 carefully selected
objects from the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a>. The
complete list of objects is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/british-museum-objects/">available
here</a>.
There are 100 episodes (one per object), each around 14 minutes long and
6.5 MB in audio only MP3 format. They are all produced to an
exceptionally high standard. More information on each object is
available online at either the BBC or British Museum websites and many
can be seen on display at the museum.</p>

<p>Each episode is presented by Neil MacGregor (the Director of the British
Museum) and introduces the object before proceeding to it’s historical
context. Sometimes this is the method of its creation or it’s usage or
it’s passage through time. For instance, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/f7two-a7R-6OhPFDbJOmIA">episode
90</a>
details a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_(jade)">jade Bi</a>
originally crafted in the bronze age, but now with a poem carved into it
by the Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor">Qianlong
Emperor</a> around 1790AD,
is used to illustrate “Exploration, Exploitation and Enlightenment” in
the 18th century. Sometimes there is also a discussion of the object’s
meaning to modern viewers, like the homosexual scenes displayed on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Cup">Warren Cup</a> in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/D6XhBBXCTPy-tLxOUvy-FQ">episode
36</a>.
The objects are from across the world and time although cultures that
left objects of a more durable nature and written histories feature more
regularly. Hence most of the objects are from Europe and Asia. while
there is a single object from Australia. The cliche may be that the
victors’ write history, but this series suggests history is written by
those who actually manage to write it at all - especially if written in
stone or metal.</p>

<p>Despite most human-made objects being created in the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/06/quantifying-history">last century or
so</a>,
the chosen objects are distributed reasonably evenly over time. It takes
35 objects to reach 1 AD and another 21 objects to reach 1000AD. The
object’s are presented in chronological order, but organised into a
groups of 5 by a theme describing the broad brush stroke of history at
that point in time. The first theme is “Making Us Human” (2,000,000 to
9000BC) and the last “The World of Our Making” (from 1914 to present).
Inbetween there are topics like “The Beginning of Science &amp; Literature”
(1500 - 700 BC), “The Rise of World Faiths” (200 - 600 AD) and “The
First Global Economy” (1450 - 1600 AD). It would take a particularly
indifferent listener not to find a couple of interesting stories among
the series.</p>

<p>There are far too many objects to discuss them all, but here are some I
found noteworthy. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/TnAQ0B8bQkSJzKZFWo6F-g">Object
#15</a>
is an early writing tablet detailing beer rations for workers. It seems
writing is likely to have started for the utilitarian purpose of
accounting, only later being used for fiction. A jade axe made in Italy
but found in Britain (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/ZRfYPmVMSgmqZyFEY8VRJA">object
#14</a>)
and a Minoan bronze (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/eU0DV7kOQ5inxmklD__YIw">object
#18</a>)
made with materials from the Middle East, demonstrate that long distance
trade routes existed over 3000 years ago. Then there are the cultures
previously unknown to me, like the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche">Moche</a> (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/HA8I9FqZTCuAZJQLFflqNg">object
#48</a>)
and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huastec_people">Huastec</a> (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/nhxe3gAeQ3KW5746ILnGmA">object
#69</a>).
This was even the case within Europe with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotharingia">Kingdom of
Lotharingia</a> (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/4jY66b8hQumUbeudll4R_w">object
#53</a>),
precariously squeezed between early France and Germany (and soon
swallowed by them). There are also pottery shards from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilwa_Kisiwani">Kilwa,
Tanzania</a> (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/1HzhZH2YTMWUgqXXFvhAeQ">object
#60</a>),
evidence of medieval cities and trading posts along the east African
coast. The series ends with a credit card (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/npZ_CaB-T4CbBfJ7qRs17w">object
#99</a>)
and a solar powered lamp &amp; mobile phone charger (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/lvsof-uPTpeh-VRmmywHIw">object
#100</a>) - a good choice for the current world and an optimistic look towards the
future respectively.</p>

    <p>After honours I was offered a government scholarship to study for a PhD.
This was the standard way of financing postgrad study, all the other PhD
students in the <a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/">UWA CS department</a> had the
same scholarship. I started the PhD in January 1996, but by September
1997 I had deferred the scholarship, started looking for a job and
unofficially quit my studies. The official end came 6 months later when
the scholarship was rescinded and a letter arrived saying “don’t ever
come back” (I paraphrase). I don’t regret that year and a half. I learnt
a great deal about logic, a little bit about programming and
substantially more about the world outside of computer science - all
paid for by the Australian taxpayer (thanks guys!).</p>
