website</a>.</p>

<p>Originally broadcast on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio/">BBC radio</a>, A
History of the World in 100 Objects is an epic series attempting to
describe all human history via the stories of a 100 carefully selected
objects from the <a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/">British Museum</a>. The
complete list of objects is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/british-museum-objects/">available
here</a>.
There are 100 episodes (one per object), each around 14 minutes long and
6.5 MB in audio only MP3 format. They are all produced to an
exceptionally high standard. More information on each object is
available online at either the BBC or British Museum websites and many
can be seen on display at the museum.</p>

<p>Each episode is presented by Neil MacGregor (the Director of the British
Museum) and introduces the object before proceeding to it’s historical
context. Sometimes this is the method of its creation or it’s usage or
it’s passage through time. For instance, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/f7two-a7R-6OhPFDbJOmIA">episode
90</a>
details a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi_(jade)">jade Bi</a>
originally crafted in the bronze age, but now with a poem carved into it
by the Chinese <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qianlong_Emperor">Qianlong
Emperor</a> around 1790AD,
is used to illustrate “Exploration, Exploitation and Enlightenment” in
the 18th century. Sometimes there is also a discussion of the object’s
meaning to modern viewers, like the homosexual scenes displayed on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Cup">Warren Cup</a> in <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/D6XhBBXCTPy-tLxOUvy-FQ">episode
36</a>.
The objects are from across the world and time although cultures that
left objects of a more durable nature and written histories feature more
regularly. Hence most of the objects are from Europe and Asia. while
there is a single object from Australia. The cliche may be that the
victors’ write history, but this series suggests history is written by
those who actually manage to write it at all - especially if written in
stone or metal.</p>

<p>Despite most human-made objects being created in the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/06/quantifying-history">last century or
so</a>,
the chosen objects are distributed reasonably evenly over time. It takes
35 objects to reach 1 AD and another 21 objects to reach 1000AD. The
object’s are presented in chronological order, but organised into a
groups of 5 by a theme describing the broad brush stroke of history at
that point in time. The first theme is “Making Us Human” (2,000,000 to
9000BC) and the last “The World of Our Making” (from 1914 to present).
Inbetween there are topics like “The Beginning of Science &amp; Literature”
(1500 - 700 BC), “The Rise of World Faiths” (200 - 600 AD) and “The
First Global Economy” (1450 - 1600 AD). It would take a particularly
indifferent listener not to find a couple of interesting stories among
the series.</p>

<p>There are far too many objects to discuss them all, but here are some I
found noteworthy. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/TnAQ0B8bQkSJzKZFWo6F-g">Object
#15</a>
is an early writing tablet detailing beer rations for workers. It seems
writing is likely to have started for the utilitarian purpose of
accounting, only later being used for fiction. A jade axe made in Italy
but found in Britain (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/ZRfYPmVMSgmqZyFEY8VRJA">object
#14</a>)
and a Minoan bronze (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/eU0DV7kOQ5inxmklD__YIw">object
#18</a>)
made with materials from the Middle East, demonstrate that long distance
trade routes existed over 3000 years ago. Then there are the cultures
previously unknown to me, like the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moche">Moche</a> (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/HA8I9FqZTCuAZJQLFflqNg">object
#48</a>)
and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huastec_people">Huastec</a> (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/nhxe3gAeQ3KW5746ILnGmA">object
#69</a>).
This was even the case within Europe with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotharingia">Kingdom of
Lotharingia</a> (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/4jY66b8hQumUbeudll4R_w">object
#53</a>),
precariously squeezed between early France and Germany (and soon
swallowed by them). There are also pottery shards from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilwa_Kisiwani">Kilwa,
Tanzania</a> (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/1HzhZH2YTMWUgqXXFvhAeQ">object
#60</a>),
evidence of medieval cities and trading posts along the east African
coast. The series ends with a credit card (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/npZ_CaB-T4CbBfJ7qRs17w">object
#99</a>)
and a solar powered lamp &amp; mobile phone charger (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/lvsof-uPTpeh-VRmmywHIw">object
#100</a>) - a good choice for the current world and an optimistic look towards the
future respectively.</p>

    <p>After honours I was offered a government scholarship to study for a PhD.
This was the standard way of financing postgrad study, all the other PhD
students in the <a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/">UWA CS department</a> had the
same scholarship. I started the PhD in January 1996, but by September
1997 I had deferred the scholarship, started looking for a job and
unofficially quit my studies. The official end came 6 months later when
the scholarship was rescinded and a letter arrived saying “don’t ever
come back” (I paraphrase). I don’t regret that year and a half. I learnt
a great deal about logic, a little bit about programming and
substantially more about the world outside of computer science - all
paid for by the Australian taxpayer (thanks guys!).</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Joel Spolsky has often <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/21.html">blogged his opinions on Software
Architects</a>. Those
people who design whole software environments and their tendency to
become astronauts (that is divorced from the realities on the ground). I
have a great deal of empathy with his view. Grounded architects may have
some use in large companies to set a general technical direction and aid
communication among independently working teams. In smaller groups there
is no need for them, yet they often appear. Recently I have worked on
small teams of 5-10 developers with 10-20 tasks that need to be done
immediately. At these workplaces there has been a focus on getting
things done and we have all handled our own design, relying on
professionalism to keep us all moving in the same direction. So luckily
I have avoided Software Architects for many years, but my luck is
running out - I have just encountered people ready for take-off.</p>

<p>I have some empathy for the architect - just a little. I used to have
designs on being an architect. I wanted to do things the “right way” (in
quotes because it is always a matter of opinion, with many caveats). For
a technical person it seems like the place where you can have the most
influence. It is also part of the informal software development career
path, on which I was once travelling. However, as I enjoy programming I
would help code my solutions. Thus I encountered the problems that occur
when abstract perfection meets messy reality. Solving the problem has to
come first - to paraphrase Jeff Atwood the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/12/it-came-from-planet-architecture.html">architecture should be
framed in the context of the
problem</a>.</p>

<p>Now I think the first priority should be solving the clients’ problem.
For the last 6 years or so I have chosen workplaces that emphasise
“getting things done”, especially since timescales are always tight. One
can make the argument that it takes time to do things right and we
should take that time. That is true, and if that is hugely important you
should probably work someplace else. Where I currently work, our
original project was to create a complete European government bond
trading platform in around 3 months. The market opportunity was fading
fast and costs were increasing. If an extra year was taken to produce a
technically beautiful solution the result would be useless as the
investment wouldn’t be recouped in a reasonable timeperiod. Corners had
to be cut and they were, but we delivered on time. Now when time allows
we can refactor the system into a better state.</p>

<p>The current architect wannabees I have encountered are ranting that the
reason they can’t get their job done is that our environment is crap
(despite being part of the team that created that environment). It needs
to be ripped up and started again the “right way”. They produce eloquent
arguments for beautiful service-oriented architectures. While I agree
that their vision is better than our reality, it in no way reflects our
reality. Worse, they are not very good coders, and they use our “wrong”
but working environment as their excuse for their messy, buggy code.
When given the chance to rework something from scratch without
dependencies on other components they still produce buggy, messy,
unreliable code that no one wants to use and took 4 times as long as the
original working version. This has happened not once, but twice! As a
result, we are further from the right way as we have to cover the other
person’s unfinished work and fight their new code, leaving us less time
for refactoring. Yet still they continue, it will all be better if we
just do everything their way. Personally, I’d rather just solve the
problem at hand - which at the moment includes them!</p>

<p>Just had to get that off my chest.</p>

    <p>The worst question you can ask a PhD student is “tell me about your
thesis”. Or at least, that was the joke among the postgrad students at
the <a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/">UWA CS department</a> in the mid 1990’s.
I took this seriously and prepared an explanation of my thesis that I
thought most people could understand (assuming some small knowledge of
logic). I only ever used this explanation once many years ago (at a job
interview for Rio Tinto R&amp;TD). So it is about time I explained it again
before I forget it all. For reference I did not complete my PhD,
dropping out after 18 months.</p>

<p>The provisional title of my thesis was “Using Nonmonotonic Logic to
extend Inductive Logic Programming”, and the research proposal is
<a href="/assets/posts/uni/phd_proposal.pdf">here</a>. The idea was to have
computers learn logical rules in a more natural manner than the existing
systems. First some background on each of the two terms in the title.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-order_logic">First-order Logic</a> is
what most people mean when talking about logic. It involves formulas
like <code class="highlighter-rouge">flies(X) &lt;- bird(X)</code> (all birds fly), which if you also have
<code class="highlighter-rouge">bird(Tweety)</code> (Tweety is a bird) implies <code class="highlighter-rouge">flies(Tweety)</code> (Tweety can
fly). One issue with First-order Logic is that it assumes perfect
knowledge. That is, it assumes that everything is known and correct.
Thus it is monotonic - it is not possible for any future information to
invalidate any previous implications. It can’t handle the situation
where in addition to the knowledge above, we later learn that Tweety is
a penguin and that penguins don’t fly. This new information invalidates
our old implication that Tweety flys and is not allowed. Instead you
have to know from that start that birds fly unless they are penguins.
However, Ostriches don’t fly, nor do dead birds or birds with broken
wings. With a little bit of thought many more exceptions to the rule
“birds fly” can be imagined, and the rule becomes unwieldly.</p>

<p>In real-world problems there can be many exceptions or inconsistent data
(noise), so First-order Logic can be problematic for machine learning.
There are ways around this though. Often it is used in self-contained
well-understood domain with few exceptions. However, many systems
instead use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-monotonic_logic">Non-monotonic
Logic</a>, which allows
new knowledge to contradict old beliefs. Many Non-monotonic Logic
constructs seem so intuitive it is hard to imagine thinking without
them. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_world_assumption">Closed-world Assumption
(CWA)</a> says that
if something is not known it must be false. When reading a train
timetable with a train at 8am and the next specified train at 9am, you
are using the CWA when you assume there is no train at 8:20am. Similar
is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negation_as_failure">Negation As Failure
(NAF)</a> (indeed it has
been proven they are logically the same) where if something can’t be
proven true then it must be false - sounds like a few university
researchers I knew. If you have used
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>, then you should be
familiar with NAF. The logic I was mainly working on was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_logic">Default
Logic</a>, which allows rules
to be true by default assuming there is some justification. This allows
exceptions in a compact and natural rule system.</p>

<p>Given the rules resulting from the learning system would be in a
Non-monotonic Logic, the next step is to describe how those rules are
learnt. The example above where it was implied that Tweety could fly is
an example of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductive_reasoning">Deductive
Reasoning</a>. Deduction
is the process of using some rules and some background facts to imply
new facts. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_reasoning">Inductive
Reasoning</a> is the
reverse, deriving rules from facts. So if you know Tweety is a bird and
that Tweety flies, then you might derive the rule that all birds fly.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_logic_programming">Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP)</a> is just
the term for computer programs that perform this process with the
resulting rules as logic system. They take a set of background knowledge
and sets of positive and negative examples and try to create rules that
cover as many of the positive examples as possible while covering as few
of the negative examples as possible. This is a computationally
expensive process, computers only got powerful enough to do this for
non-trivial datasets in the late 80’s, so when I studied in the mid 90’s
the field was just getting started and becoming known.</p>

<p>My thesis attempted to marry the two concepts. There had been a few
attempts at this before, but the best known ILP systems at the time
didn’t handle exceptions or noise very well. Thus part 1 of my work was
to construct an ILP learning system that output a Non-monotonic logic.
This was about as far as I got, implementing some theoretical results
from another researcher (with minor improvements). Part 2 was handling
exceptions and noise better by flipping rules. That is, if the evidence
against a rule became too strong the system should flip it to the
reverse rule. I also looked at weakening the “strength” of a rule over
time. All rules have the same applicability in non-probalistic logics.
By “strength” I mean how long I keep a rule in my output theory before
modifying or flipping it in the presence of negative examples, or even
ignoring exceptions/noise if the rule is particularly “strong”. I didn’t
come up with anything meaningful here, I just thought it might be
useful. Although I have been told this became a hot research topic in
the years after I quit (under the term “forgetting”, I think).</p>

<p>This may sound like it was mainly a coding project, maybe because that
was where my interests lie. Most of my time should have been spent doing
maths to prove my work was correct as it was a very theoretical field.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Memories.html">Memories</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Over 10 years ago I did <a href="http://www.courts.dotag.wa.gov.au/J/jury_duty.aspx">jury duty in
Australia</a>. While
researching the legalities of writing about my experience, 90% of the
pages returned from a Google search were about how to avoid jury duty. I
can understand the sentiment. Dodging it was my first thought upon
receiving the letter announcing my random selection. However, work was
slow and my employer was ok with me being away for a week, so I decided
not to fight the summons.</p>

<p>I turned up at the District Court in the Perth CBD on the allotted day.
The couple of hundred jury candidates for that week were corralled
together and given a talk on our responsibilities and how the system
worked (just the standard stuff like there are 12 jurors on a case and
not to talk to anyone about your case). We were then told to wait until
our name was called and we left in groups of around 30 or so. There was
not much talking or socialising - it didn’t seem that most people were
happy to be there. I was called into the third group to depart. We went
into a courtroom and told the case was an assault and who the main
participants would be (so we could excuse ourselves if we knew any of
them). Then potential jurors were called to the stand, but about half
were rejected by the lawyers before they got there. No questions or
reasons were given for the rejections. The lawyers didn’t event look at
the jurors, they were head down in paper - presumably our details. My
name wasn’t called by the time twelve jurors were chosen, so I and the
remainder were led out of the court and back to the waiting room. I was
called into another group after a short wait, this was for a sexual
assault where most of the people involved had the same surname. I was
called but rejected and quite happy about it. After another short wait I
was called to a drug case, selected and not rejected. I was a juror.</p>

<p>It was supposed to be a 3 day case, but we started late on the first day
and finished early on the last day. Also, we (the jury) spent probably a
third of the time out of the court as the lawyers argued points of law.
The basics of the case were that the police were looking for a lost cat.
While searching they looked through the window of a house and saw what
looked like hydroponic equipment - it was also the house the cat was in.
They called in a special squad, entered the house (let the cat out) and
found the remains of a large marijuana cultivation operation. While no
actual cannabis was present, there were the remains of hundreds of
plants. All this was recorded on film, including the arrival of the
defendant who asked what was happening at his house. The defendant gave
a tour of the house on tape and talked (somewhat reticently, but without
being overly pressured) about how he grew drugs there, albeit with
little detail beyond describing what we could see.</p>

<p>The procecution case rested heavily on his video confession. They then
showed proof that the defendant actually owned the house, followed by
evidence that it was a drug factory producing commercial quantities of
cannabis. Finally, they said that even though no drugs were found, the
law allowed that all the used equipment was good enough for conviction
on the current drug cultivation charges. The defendant claimed personal
use for a wasting illness, though there was no mention of why he needed
so much. Then we had to decide. There was no overacting or histrionics
like in TV or the movies. Most of the time neither lawyer looked at us -
then were looking down at the notes the entire time, even when
questioning witnesses. Both lawyers were just doing their job. The only
time the process seemed to deviate from the banal, judging from the
lawyers slightly increased excitement level, is when they would ask for
us to be removed from the room. Or, maybe that was just me being
intrigued by what I was missing.</p>

<p>I don’t remember the details about any of my fellow jurors. They were a
bunch of average people, no one really stood out as unreasonable. When
we got in the room we first did an anonymous vote - about eight or nine
of us (including me) voted guilty. After the vote we talked and it
seemed no one was particularly keen to convict, but some people looked
harder than others for a reason not to. At first the question was
whether growing marijuana should be a crime at all. The scale of the
operation won that argument fairly quickly. No one believed the personal
use story. However, if there was only a couple of plants I think he
would have been found innocent as the majority of us backed this view.
Next there was the argument he was a patsy. Conspiracy theories
abounded. I had some sympathy with these - the case wasn’t quite right
and the constant requests for us to leave the room had made us all feel
we were missing something. The defendant did not come across as a smart
or rich man, yet had a second house full of drugs. There must have been
other people involved. Also where did all the drugs go? The operation
was supposedly shutdown a few days or few weeks before the police found
it. Some people even thought the cat story was a bit fishy and the
police were in on the whole thing.</p>

<p>In the end the video won all arguments. The tape had no edits as far as
we could tell, and showed the defendant from the time he first
encountered the police. After some identification, warnings about
getting a lawyer then without any more coercion than a few strongly put
questions, he completely confessed. We watched it a couple of times,
then the holdouts agreed to convict. There may have been a group of
people involved, but the defendant was definitely one of them. The
decision took a couple of hours. When we presented our verdict to the
court the judge thanked us and said that the result was completely in
keeping with the evidence presented to us. So what was the evidence not
presented to us? We were led out of the court building immediately and
didn’t see the sentencing.</p>

<p>I never saw or spoke to any of the other jury members again. I checked
the papers for a few days afterwards to see what happened, but couldn’t
find anything that seemed like my case. My main memory of the experience
was boredom. We spent most of the three days waiting. The case itself
was interesting, but the lawyers belaboured their points. I assume they
wanted to be certain we understood what they were saying. The whole
thing could have been done in a couple of hours if succinctness was
prioritised. Still, if that was a stereotypical jury experience I
wouldn’t have an issue doing it again.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is: never admit guilt on camera!</p>
