<p>What is your earliest memory? Are you sure?</p>

<p>I always thought my earliest memory was laying on a folding bed and
feeling the ground shake, so I ran outside to the garden next to a large
rock. This was in Australia, but wasn’t the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/01/life-on-a-building-site.html">house in
Leeming</a>
we moved to sometime in 1979 (because I know we were there by the time I
started school). Thus it must have occurred sometime in 1978 or 1979. I
always assumed it was 1978. However, using the power of the Internet, I
looked it up. Here is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earthquakes_in_Western_Australia">list of the earthquakes of note in Western
Australia</a>.
Not many and only one of around the right time. The <a href="http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/25962/20040718-0000/www.seismicity.segs.uwa.edu.au/seismicity_of_western_australia/wa_historical/cadoux.html">Cadoux
earthquake</a>
was at 9:48 on the morning of 2 June 1979 and was strong enough to be
felt in Perth, 180km away. This seems way too late, I thought we had
moved to Leeming by then. I couldn’t find when the Leeming house was
built, but we were definitely living there by 1980 as that was when I
started primary school at
<a href="http://www.oberthurps.det.wa.edu.au/">Oberthur</a> and I have a few
memories of that time. I also went to pre-primary at Oberthur while in
Leeming, but I don’t know for how long.</p>

<p>So is the memory correct? I know there was an earthquake, but was it at
the same time as the folding bed and rock? It is possible the memory is
accurate. If I did less than 6 months pre-primary, it could have been
just before we moved to Leeming. Or maybe I’m conflating two different
memories. The memory is more vivid than others from around the same
time: visiting our house in Leeming when it was being built; hearing
that the class mouse had died in pre-primary; and, seeing the changing
light display on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Brewery">Old Swan
Brewery</a> as part of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAY_%2779">Perth Sesquicentennial</a>. Those
memories are more static, like they are really memories of a photo (but
as far as I know there are no photos of these events). Perhaps they are
memories of memories. The rock/earthquake memory has movement and
context. There also exists a photo of me next to the rock from around
that time. Maybe a long time ago the memories of various things got
merged. I’m not sure anymore.</p>
