<h4>Life on a building site</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>I grew up on a building site. Not literally, but effectively. For a
decade of my youth a building site was always just a short walk or bike
ride away. We were one of the first families to move into the suburb of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeming,_Western_Australia">Leeming</a> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia">Perth</a>, which
developed from just a few houses to several thousand over the years we
were there.</p>

<p>In the late 1970’s Perth expanded into several new suburbs that had
previously been farmland or bush. One of these was Leeming. Ours must
have been within the first dozen houses built in the suburb. When we
moved in, the house next door was under construction - every other side
was bush. There were a few houses around the corner and several on
Gracechurch Crescent, although most of those were display houses. Over
time the land was cleared, blocks marked out and buildings would rise.
The bush over the road was turned into a park. The foreign cliche is
that Australians have kangaroos jumping down their streets. It is
virtually never true, Australia is a very urbanised country and
kangaroos generally don’t like cities. I never saw kangaroos on the
street, but there were some in the bush over the road as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goanna">small
goannas</a>, snakes and spiders. I
remember a goanna eating the strawberries in our front garden. Apart
from the spiders (which were everywhere), these animals slowly
disappeared.</p>

<p>The building sites that replaced the bush were much more fun for play.
All the local kids knew the rhythm of a new build. We could run around
the original sparse bush, but when the land was cleared and flattened
the games were paused. Then a concrete pad was laid to act as a
foundation for the house which offered a few minutes of interest. We
returned to the site while the walls (2 layers of brick with a small air
gap between them) were erected. This was the best time on site. We could
run round the rooms, hide behind half built walls in games of chase or
something more violent (cops &amp; robbers, throwing tennis balls at each
other). Also there would be bits of metal or broken bricks to
investigate or throw around. Normally there was a large pile of yellow
sand for the cement mixer that was useful for making sand castles and
the like. A few kids liked making tunnels in the piles of sand using
detritus from the build as supports. I help make some of these, but
never went inside, I was a little too claustrophobic. I heard a few kids
around Perth died when such tunnels collapsed, but there was never a
collapse in our area (that I knew about). When the walls were complete
the roof went on. The sand would disappear to be replaced by piles of
tiles. I can only assume the builders knew a few would be broken after
school hours. Once the roof was finished, the windows and doors quickly
went in. That was the end of the site for play. No one I knew broke the
windows or into a house - it always seemed easier just to move onto the
site next door. Lastly someone would move in and we would see if any new
kids were around. A couple of times we went and knocked on the door and
asked if there were any children who wanted to play.</p>

<p>As time passed the distance to new sites grew ever larger, corresponding
with lessening interest in playing on them. A few years into school I
had to travel to the other end of Leeming to find a site (there were
some big ones over there - retail buildings, schools, a large road). I
didn’t do this often. Although I remember one friend, Stephen, who had
just moved to the area and like to explore the sites, so I kept my hand
in. By the mid 80’s we moved out of the area and I haven’t played on a
building site since.</p>
