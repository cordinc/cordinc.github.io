</ul>

<p>Calculating the price of an EGB bond has to be fast. A big bank may have
400 or so European bond obligations and the quotes need to be
recalculated quickly when the market moves. It is possible to recover
from incorrect prices on D2C markets, with their negotiable RFQs.
However, if an executable D2D quote is wrong then the trader will likely
lose money.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>By fast I mean determining all the actively quoted prices and sending
them to the market in around 50 milliseconds. Fast enough that humans
can not be involved in the pricing system in any direct manner. Other
instruments, like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market">FX</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock">equities</a> have even lower latency
requirements (they need to be faster), but they don’t need as much
calculation. This is an ever decreasing target, when I started on EGB
desks in 2007 the equivalent figure was around 125 milliseconds. It
depends entirely on the relative speed of the other banks on the D2D
markets. There are three rough categories of EGB pricing speed. The
fastest couple of banks can get their prices updated quickly enough that
they can make money off the slowest handful - a process known as latency
arbitrage. The majority of banks sit safely inbetween these two
extremes, neither profiting from the slower banks nor losing money
(except to mistakes). Of course over time banks improve their systems
and the speeds needed to be safe or profitable only increase. I have
worked for banks that at various points have been in all three
categories and a significant proportion of my time has been spend
analysing and improving EGB pricing speed. At the moment I would guess
50ms pricing would definitely be safe, towards 100ms is danger territory
and below 10ms could be profitable.</p>

<p>It is vital to detect when the yield curve moves and reprice
appropriately. For EGBs the yield curve is driven by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurex#Interest-rate_derivatives">German bond
futures</a>
traded on the Eurex market in Frankfurt. These futures are derivative
contracts to deliver a specified German government bond at a future
date. There are a number of them categorised by the maturity of the bond
to be delivered. The Schatz delivers a bond with a remaining maturity
around 2 years in the future. The Bobl delivers a 5 year bond, while the
Bund returns a 10 year and a 30 year bond for the Buxl. The contracts
last 9 months and new futures contracts are created every 3 months. So
there is always a current contract with the correct tenor. Every quarter
the futures used in the yield curve are converted to the current
contract. The point every quarter where the new futures take over from
the old contracts is known as the “futures roll”.</p>

<p>For example at the moment there are three <a href="http://www.eurexchange.com/trading/products/INT/FIX/FGBL_en.html">Bund futures
contracts</a>
available for trading - expiring in December 2011, March 2012 or June 2012. This month the December contract will expire and be replaced with
a September 2012 contract. When the December contract matures those that
are short will have to deliver German bonds maturing in roughly 10 years
to those with long positions. The contract will list a basket of bonds
which may be delivered. The cheapest of these is known as the Cheapest
To Deliver (CTD) and is always the one which is actually delivered.
Normally the CTD does not change during the length of the contract, but
a basket is specified to make it hard to manipulate the futures price.</p>

<p>There are also Italian Government bond futures, but I haven’t heard of
these being used for pricing, just hedging. Even if they were used for
pricing I can’t imagine it would be for anything other than Italian
bonds, whereas the German bond futures affect the entire Euro bond
market.</p>

<p>The Schatz, Bobl and Bund futures are the most liquid instruments on the
European yield curve and so are used for the 2, 5 and 10 year points.
The relatively new Buxl contract is increasingly used as the driving
point at the long end of the curve. Although there is some question over
its liquidity, so some places may use swaps or a specially computed
point instead. Below the 2 year mark Euribor futures are used to drive
the curve - although I haven’t dealt much with the short end. I’ve seen
curves with other instruments like swaps, but for EGB pricing the German
bond futures are always the dominant drivers. If a future changes value
then the curve adjusts slightly and the bond prices are recalculated.</p>

<p>Bond prices are determined using a spread off the yield curve at the
point corresponding to the bond’s maturity. The size of the spread is
determined by credit risk plus liquidity or other terms. Some banks may
have a yield curve for each Eurozone country despite them having the
same currency and central bank. Visualising these country curves better
capture the credit risk of each country and a quant once suggested it
also aided pricing. The German curve is the closest to the idealised
curve, as it is the safest country. Other countries then spread further
away until Greece is reached, clearly worse and separate from the core.
As all these curves are based off the same futures, they all move
roughly in sync with each other as the futures move. Sometimes they move
separately if a country’s perceived risk changes relative to the
benchmark - the Bund future.</p>

<p>Thus European government bonds generally move in known ways relative to
each other and the futures. This can be used for hedging. Traders are
constantly aware of the interest rate risk they are taking with their
positions (using DV01 as described in Part 1). Generally they are
supposed to keep their risk flat - that is close to 0. They will have a
set risk limit and every night their positions will be checked against
this limit. Regularly or excessively exceeding your limit is a serious
offence. Trying to hide being over the risk limit is one of the
definitions of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_trader">rogue
trader</a>. EGB traders
generally are not supposed to take risks and so have relatively low risk
limits. They are considered flow traders, working to create business
with clients and this doesn’t require them to take risks (although some
do take small’ish risks). They are not supposed to be trading for the
bank’s account (like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_trading">proprietary or prop
trading</a>). Instead
they keep their positions small and take a small cut of a large flow of
trades with clients (or at least that is the theory). It is supposed to
be steady money, without taking any directional bets, just taking the
spread difference between the D2D and D2C markets. When I started a
quant explained to me that an EGB desk should not make huge amounts of
money, but should never lose money either.</p>

<p>When a position is taken, to keep their risk down the EGB traders hedge.
That is they trade something else in such a way as to counteract the
interest rate risk of the original trade. Thus the two (or more) trades
when combined result in flat risk. The obvious way to do this is just to
do the reverse trade. That is if a trader buys 10 million of a bond from
a client, then immediate turn around and sell the same bonds to someone
else. Thus the total position is zero and the risk is zero. However,
this is not normally profitable (due to the spread). There was a
beginner trader who liked to do this - he constantly lost money in a
booming market and was sacked after a few months. Normally it is
necessary to hold onto a position for some time before trading out of a
position profitably, so other means of hedging are utilised.</p>

<p>Usually hedging means trading the German bond futures. With every
futures roll, the proportion of each future that offsets each bond is
calculated (usually by the quants). Thus at a point in time a trader may
known that for every million in a bond they hold, selling 500,000 Bunds
and 200,000 Schatz will offset their risk. This works as the futures are
more liquid than any particular bond and the spreads are tighter. Of
course the fact that most Euro bonds are hedged with futures is one of
the reasons they are so liquid. The Italian bond futures and swaps are
also used for hedging on occasion, but the German futures are the most
popular. The liquidity in the futures market also means that traders use
various strategies to eke out a little extra profit without too much
risk. For example a trader may only hedge half of what they need
immediately if the market is moving in their favour, hedging the rest a
little later at a better price.</p>

<p>Hedging out interest rate risk does not mean there is no risk associated
with holding a position. Credit risk is still present. Imagine a Spanish
bond is hedged with the German futures. What happens if the Spanish
yield curve moves independently of the German curve, because Spain’s
credit risk changes relative to the rest of Europe (or at least
Germany). At this point the hedge breaks down and the trader either
makes or loses money depending on their position. This is what is
happening right now in the debt markets. Italy is seen as an increasing
risk versus Germany and thus its yields are rising. Anyone long Italian
bonds hedged with short German futures is losing money. I know this is
happening to some people at the moment.</p>

<p>Theoretically it is possible to hedge away the credit risk with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap">Credit
Default Swaps (CDS)</a>,
which is basically just insurance on a bond issuer’s default. However I
never saw this used - I’m not sure why, perhaps the cost was too high or
it was seen as unnecessary. Instead EGB traders either ignored credit
risk (the likelihood a country in the Eurozone defaulting seemed very
remote until recently) or just didn’t keep their positions for long.</p>

<p>EGB desks are not like High Frequency Trading (HFT) desks where the
length of time a position is held can be counted in milliseconds.
Normally it is hours, or often days. If the position was very large the
traders may skew the price to encourage others to hit their prices, or
ask the salespeople to work away their inventory. In any case, a
position is rarely held to maturity. I know of a few bugs in risk
systems at large banks related to maturing bonds or futures and which
have never been fixed because “that situation never happens” (as a
trader once said to me about futures). Holding an instrument to maturity
doesn’t involve much profit, but does involve extra bureaucracy and
paperwork (especially for futures with the delivery of the relevant
underlying bond). It’s easier just to flat the position before maturity.</p>

<p>As previously stated, the two main components of a European government
bond’s price are interest rates and credit risk. Credit risk is
basically the risk of the country defaulting. This risk is driving
European bond prices at the moment. Prices rising for this reason is
often called the result of “bond vigilantes” - traders punishing a
government for its poor finances and worsening position. It is claimed
that austerity will save us from these vigilantes. Although such claims
from politicians ignore the other factor driving bond prices. A country
heading towards a recession will likely lower its interest rates in the
near future to stimulate its economy. Alternatively, in a booming
economy interest rates tend to rise. So other things being equal, if a
country’s economy is slowing then the yield of its bonds is likely to
decrease in the expectation of lower interest rates from the central
bank. This is what we are seeing in the UK, credit risk hasn’t changed
much but with a recession likely or at least a weak economy, bond yields
are at historic lows.</p>

<p>EGB traders keep an eye out for any news that may affect these factors.
Millisecond to millisecond pricing is done by the futures driving the
yield curve. So traders instead use expectations to adjust spreads, grow
or shrink positions for a little profit (within their limits) or turn
off quoting in advance of expected volatility. If a large or step change
in futures’ pricing is possible, then turning off quotes until the
market has settled lessens the likelihood of making a trade which is bad
a few milliseconds later (and thus meaning the hedge is done at the
wrong level). This often occurred around big economic announcements
which could quickly change views of an economy’s direction.</p>

<p>Quoting was always turned off for the largest economic news - monthly US
non-farm payrolls (often abbreviated to just “non-farm”), announced on
the first Friday of each month at 8:30am New York time (usually 1:30pm
London time). The payroll figure describes the number of jobs created
(or lost) in the US economy over the previous month along with average
pay rises and hours worked. This gives an indication of where the US
economy is heading, and thus the world as the US is still the largest
component of the world economy. If the US is booming, it is more likely
the rest of the world will be too - and vice-versa. The neutral payroll
figure is around 200,000 jobs created in a month, as this matches the
monthly workforce increase in the US (it is a big country!). Thus lower
jobs figures suggest lower bond yields and higher job figures imply
higher bond yields.</p>

<p>As always with such economic indicators, it is the difference in
expectations that has an effect. In the days leading up to the
announcement analysts try to predict the figure and the consensus of
these expectations are built into bond prices. When the real figure is
announced the prices are adjusted relative to the expected figure. Thus
if the market expects a payroll gain of 20K and the announced figure is
80K gained, then yields will rise despite the small gain suggesting a
slowing economy.</p>

<p>Resolving the difference between reality and expectation can cause bond
prices to jump. This creates lots of noise on the trading floor. Someone
junior normally has the job of shouting out the figure as it is
released. The more surprising the announcement, the louder the shouting
afterward. When the series of bad payroll numbers came out during the
financial crisis, the traders cheered loudly. It seems perverse to cheer
US job destruction, but as previously stated traders only look at their
personal PnL, not the wider picture. In this case the traders had
permission to build up a long position and so the falling yields after a
bad number made them money.</p>

<p>The noisiest I have heard a trading floor was immediately after
non-farms during the start of the financial crisis and the day after
Lehman’s went bust. On these occasions it got close to the levels seen
in movies when there is a panic. Trading floors are generally noisy
places with lots of desks packed together. There are always people
shouting instructions, conversing or talking on phones. TVs are
constantly on but with the sound turned off unless something big is
happening (terrorist attack, Lehman’s collapse, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes">Ashes</a>). The most annoying
noise is the computers. Traders often have their PCs set up to play a
noise on various events: a trade done, RFQ received, large price move,
etc. So there are constant laser blasts, ka-chings, buzzers, animal
sounds, movie quotes and more. It can be hard to concentrate with these
intentionally attention grabbing noises. Traders don’t seem to mind too
much, they are constantly focussed on the present - though not so good
for programming. Strangely one noise almost never heard on a trading
floor is a mobile phone ring. Banks like to record all communication for
compliance reasons, so personal mobiles are banned or discouraged as
they can’t be recorded.</p>

<p>There is probably more to EGB trading than the above - but this is what
I have seen and had explained to me.</p>
