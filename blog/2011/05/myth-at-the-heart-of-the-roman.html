<p>Like the previously reviewed <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/myth-in-the-greek-and-roman-wo.html">Myth in the Greek and Roman
Worlds</a>,
these podcasts are part of <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open University</a>
course <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a330.htm">A330: Myth in the Greek and Roman
Worlds</a>.
These podcasts examine how Rome represents its foundation myths through
a number of historical objects, ranging in origin from the classical
period to the 17th century. The series is composed of 10 episodes with:
5 video podcasts on specific artifacts; 2 audio and a video podcast
introducing or giving an overview of the topic; and, two audio podcasts
shared with “Myth in the Greek and Roman Worlds” discussing the role of
myth in the ancient world. The video podcasts are in documentary format,
normally showing a talking head or an object being described. The video
podcasts are all around 5 minutes long (50MB) and recorded at 640x360
resolution, or a smaller iPod optimised format. Transcripts are
available in PDF format.</p>

<p>The well-known story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_of_Rome">Rome’s
Foundation</a> is that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus">Romulus and Remus</a>
(descendants of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, a prince
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy">Troy</a>) were abandoned as infants,
suckled by a she-wolf and founded the city with Romulus killing Remus in
an argument over the exact location of the new city. There is apparently
some evidence of other slightly different foundation myths, where other
families take a more prominent role. The myth in its current form became
dominant during the reign of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a> who claimed ancestry
from Romulus. Augustus was adept at manipulating Rome’s foundation myths
to help consolidate power in himself and his family.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius">Suetonius</a> writes that as an
alternative to Augustus, Octavian was offered the name Romulus as the
second founder of Rome.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Augustus">House of Augustus</a>
is the first artifact examined. Presented by Augustus as a small
domestic building, its location was further reinforced his connection
with the gods and foundation myths. It is on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatine_Hill">Palantine</a> amid rows of
temples and close to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lupercal">Lupercal</a>, where Romulus and
Remus were supposedly found by the she-wolf. In 13BC the Roman Senate
commissioned the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis">Ara Pacis</a>, an
altar to honour Augustus for bringing peace to Rome. It is the subject
of one of the podcasts and again links Augustus to the foundation myths.
The altar displays scenes of nature, Rome’s foundation and a religious
procession including the figure of Augustus himself. Augustus is also
connected to the last classical object investigated - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger">Lapis
Niger</a>. This artifact is a
number of black basalt paving stones covering an important shrine in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitium">Comitium</a> area of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum">Roman
Forum</a>. Although it is not
known what exactly the stones cover, it is know that the site is of
archaic importance in the city’s foundation.</p>

<p>It was originally though that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Wolf">Capitoline
Wolf</a> (the famous status
of Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf) was classical or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization">Etruscan</a>. However,
it is now known that the wolf statue probably dates from the medieval
period, with the twins added during the renaissance. Still the statue’s
image is plastered all over Rome as a symbol of the city as the
traditional seat of power, even in modern Italy. Many people have used
the foundation myths. In the 17th century the Popes had the d’Arpino
frescoes painted in the salon of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_dei_Conservatori#Palazzo_dei_Conservatori">Palazzo dei
Conservatori</a>
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Cesari">Giuseppe Cesari</a>.
These paintings are detailed in the last of the artifact podcasts. They
depict scenes in the foundation of Rome together with a large statue of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_X">Pope Innocent X</a>.</p>

<p>The artifact podcasts are interesting, but most of the others can be
skipped if already seen as part of a previous Open University course on
myth.</p>
