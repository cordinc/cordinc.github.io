<h4>Election Bullshit</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>On Thursday the UK held a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_alternative_vote_referendum">referendum on whether it should use the
Alternative Vote (AV) electoral
system</a>.
I didn’t hold much hope for an AV victory. While I believe AV is a
preferable over the current
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting">First-Past-The-Post</a>
(FPTP) electoral voting system, FPTP is ok and democracy generally runs
acceptably in Britain. It can be hard to get people out to vote on what
can seem like a minor issue and hard to get people to want change when
there doesn’t feel like a need for change. So with the political parties
split and voting voluntary, I expected AV to lose, and it did - by a
large margin. No problem. I’m not going to leave the UK over the
electoral system, at least not when there are so many other good reasons
to leave.</p>

<p>So what has made me care enough to write this, after the battle has been
lost? The day after the election I received a circular promoting the “No
to AV” campaign (good timing guys). There is an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/_mia/5660630645/">image of the circular
on Flickr at this
address</a>. The third
bullet point states that Australia wants to get rid of it’s AV-like
electoral system. I left Australia 8 years ago, and I still read the
Australia papers nearly every day. I have seen no mention at all of this - not from the press (even the Murdoch press) or friends. I can honestly
say I have seen infinitely more support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secessionism_in_Western_Australia">WA
succession</a>
(a fairly fringe position). After some investigation it seems that this
view is based on a single survey - <a href="http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2011/02/do-australians-really-want-to-abandon-the-alternative-vote.html">generally considered
flawed</a>.
I can’t imagine there will be a referendum on voting system in Australia
for many years. The rest of the flyer seems similarly dishonest. Many of
the points based on the assumption that the person who gets the most
votes is the “winner” and “best” candidate, which is clearly not true.
Such a person has a plurality by definition, but “best” and “winner” are
defined by the voting system used - which is the question at hand.</p>

<p>The reason I prefer AV is because it give a result more representative
of the whole constituency, rather than just the plurality. Ignoring the
possibility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">Proportional
Representation</a>
(which, to my mind, is a different argument entirely), if we assume
constituency based democracy, where one person represents an geographic
area, then it is better to have the person who most closely matches the
views of the majority of constituents (or at least those that vote). If
you disagree, well you are in the majority (in an election with only two
options AV and FPTP are effectively the same). I just wish that the
campaign to build that majority didn’t print bullshit.</p>
