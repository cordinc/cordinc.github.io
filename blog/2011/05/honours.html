<br/><br/>
<p>It was always my plan at university to do honours - it was a step on the
way to a PhD. The Computer Science degree at <a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/">The University of Western
Australia</a> was nominally a three year degree,
but a small number of students with good grades were invited to do a
fourth year in order to graduate “with honours”. I got the required
grades and thus got an invitation to do the extra year. Fourteen other
students did the same out of a third-year class of just over 100. A few
good students who must have had invitations refused - I knew a couple of
them, including one who got very good grades. Although on the whole, the
honours class was representative of the better students in our year.
That year I worked harder than I ever had before (but have a couple of
times more since). I needed to achieve 1st class (the highest grade
available) to stand a good chance of getting into the PhD program. This
is the story of that year.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>At the end of the honours year we would receive a single grade for our
degree (rather than the pass/fail of the three year degree). This would
be based solely on the grades from the extra year - as we were deemed to
have already passed the basic course. This was quite different from
other faculties (like Engineering) where the honours grade was
determined on the whole 4 years worth of coursework. Lucky for me, as my
first two years of coursework were fairly ordinary. The honours grade
was determined as 62.5% based on coursework and 37.5% on a research
project. Having studied the marking scheme carefully, I decided to focus
more attention on my coursework than the project. This was a mistake as
the final marks appeared to be more influenced by the project than the
coursework. I heard the marks for the units and the projects were set at
the same meeting where the final grade was determined - one can
speculate as the to the order these were decided.</p>

<p>Honours students had a couple of weeks to decide upon a suitable
project. A couple of people already knew what they wanted to do and just
needed to find a lecturer to supervise them. The rest of us looked at
the project lists - two or three example projects suggested by each
lecturer. I wanted to study something based in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> and
particularly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network">neural
networks</a>. I knew the
supervisor I wanted, Dr Philip Hingston, who had a couple of such
projects listed. Unfortunately, he left the department to work in
industry just before the academic year began (as it turned out he was my
manager at Rio Tinto R&amp;TD a few years later). So I chose the next
closest project on the list. It was “A Connectionist Network for Object
Recognition” supervised by Dr Paul Hadingham. I remember rushing to meet
Paul in order to claim the project in case anyone else was interested -
I needn’t have worried.</p>

<p>The basic idea was to create a system that could classify simple line
drawings in a way analogous to human sight. Thus it would have 3 layers.
First, one like the back of the eye that examined the basic parameters
of the lines (what angle it was on; whether it was curved; whether it
joined another line). The next layer would consolidate multiple lines
and compare these to known pattern, supposedly like the vision centres
at the back of the brain. The final decision on the object represented
by the drawing would be decided in the third layer, corresponding to the
cerebral cortex. The starting point would be a representation of line
drawings created by Dr Hadingham.</p>

<p>Or at least that was the theory. I started by reading academic papers
on: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammar">grammar</a>, to understand
Hadingham’s representation (including one by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_Chomsky">Noam
Chomsky</a> - I felt so
well-educated); neural networks, becoming more disillusioned the entire
time; and human vision, which for some reason seemed to involve putting
probes into living cats brains - gruesome stuff. However, in that end no
of that mattered. The system worked by using Hadingham’s representation
to convert the lines of a drawing into points in 4 or 7 dimensional
space. The points were grouped together into “features”, and then
probabilistically compared to templates representing various objects
(the templates were generated by a training set of drawings
representative of the object). If the features were close enough to an
object’s template then the drawing was of that type of object. For
instance to recognise a human, it would look for something resembling a
head, to recognise a car it would look for wheels and a roof. It all
came down to statistics, but then so do neural networks, so I didn’t
feel to bad about the whole thing. If you are masochistic my thesis is
available here in <a href="/assets/posts/uni/honours_thesis.pdf">PDF format</a> or
here in the original <a href="/assets/posts/uni/honours_thesis.ps">Postscript
format</a>. I wouldn’t recommend
reading it - its not well written.</p>

<p>Only one chapter of the thesis is devoted to the actual object
recognition. Strange considering this was the stated aim, but expected
considering the time spent on it. Much more time was spent writing a
program to nicely display the 4 and 7 dimensional representation
graphically and grouping points into features. This was because these
were more interesting programming tasks. I thought I was a scientist,
but my actions suggested more an engineer. Unfortunately I didn’t
realise this. So I spent a great deal of time writing a program to input
data files and output <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>
<a href="http://www.ursoswald.ch/LaTeXGraphics/picture/picture.html">picture</a>
graphs, which I could then include in my thesis document. Below is an
example: the image on the left was converted into the graph on the right
(the two points off by themselves represent the head). I also spent
quite some time coding solutions for solving the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clique_problem">maximal
clique</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete">NP-Complete</a> problem in order
to find features in objects. NP-Complete problems are well known in
Computer Science. It can be challenging to code solutions for them that
produce good results for large datasets in a reasonable timeframe.
Through my project learnt a great deal about computing, but it wasn’t
directly applicable to my thesis.</p>

<p>I worked hard during my honours year. Harder than any previous year of
study. The final spurt of effort to get the thesis complete took a month
and is one of the most intense sustained efforts I have produced (it has
been matched twice since). Looking back at it now, I don’t know why it
was so hard. There was a great deal of pressure to get a good grade and
I wasn’t used to writing anything over a paragraph. Then there was
preparation for a 30 minute presentation, posters for the hall, extra
coding to plug gaps in the code and the coursework. My consolation is
that all the other honours students were doing the same. Everyone pulled
a couple of all-nighters, including people who seemed to cruise through
3rd year. In the end my thesis was one of the shortest at just under 10
thousand words and my presentation went well, or at least there were no
disdainful questions at the end (as a few students encountered).</p>

<p>The five courses completed during the year did not leave much of an
impression. I had to look up two on my transcript, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert_system">Expert
Systems</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision">Computer
Vision</a>, as I had
completely forgotten them. Those two and Neural Networks all overlapped
slightly with my project, so with a bit of effort I got good grades.
Although with Neural Nets, everyone got a good mark. The lecturer had a
novel “binary” marking system for assignments. A submitted assignment
would get one out of one. Only the final exam was properly marked -
nearly everyone got over 90%. My comment on his evaluation was “1 course
delivered: 1 out 1”. Scientific communication was my worst subject. It
aimed to teach us to write properly - the lecturer had their work cut
out with me. I can image it was made required after supervisors had to
plow their way through innumerable theses written by computing students
who hadn’t written more than code comments (if they were lucky) during
the previous 3 years. The last course was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional
Programming</a>,
notable for a moment of clarity late in the course when I saw the the 10
line solution to an assignment that took me (and most others) over a
hundred lines. I saw the light and where my understanding was flawed. At
that point “got” the functional style and it was good.</p>

<p>There was a real sense of camaraderie among the honours group. It was
just the 15 of us in the same classes. Our project’s were unique, so
there was no problem with plagiarism. We spent a great deal of time in
each other’s company. Much of which was spent playing an old Mac game
called Fungus. As the year progressed an increasing percentage of our
diet consisted of Coca-Cola, chocolate and pizza. High caffeine and
sugar intake was almost a badge of honour. When we ordered in pizza
often the postgrad students would chip in. They would reminisce on their
honours year and tell us we were doomed. At 10pm, Mother’s (the local
convenience store) would shut, so by 9:30pm someone was organising a
“Mother’s run” to stock up - a small group would go and collect snacks
for the whole group. I got to know the people working there by name.
Occasionally there was the more desperate 2am “Maccas run” to a 24-hour
McDonald’s in the city, but I was never part of that. Not because I
wasn’t around at that time - I just wasn’t a fan of their food.</p>

<p>We had a special room at the end of the building - the honours lab. The
desks were arranged haphazardly, almost like a maze. It was not possible
to see the what was happening at the back from the front of the room.
Towards the end of the year I and a couple of others dragged a bunch of
the long cushioned benches that were in the hall to the back of the lab
and used them as beds. In the last few days before the thesis due date
it was too noisy in the lab to sleep, so they were moved into a vacant
tutorial room. There was a wide range of computers from Macs and PCs to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARC">Sun Sparcs</a> all with connections to
the department servers and the Internet. It was a very nice setup for 1995. None of us had anything remotely comparable at home. We used to
just roam around the network. One student found an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_mail_relay">open mail
relay</a> (there wasn’t much
spam around back then) and soon we were all telneting into port 25 on
various machines to send <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_spoofing">spoofed
emails</a>. Much hilarity
ensued until it turned out some of the faked mail from the Head of
Department wasn’t fake at all. That was the extent of my hacking.</p>

<p>During honours I became aware of the Web - starting the year being
introduced to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_(web_browser)">Mosaic</a>
and ending it with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator">Navigator</a>. I remember
one student put up suggestive photos of his girlfriend. That was
entertaining, until within a day the Head of Department came up to the
room and told him to get rid of them. In case you were wondering there
was a single woman among the 15 honours students.</p>

<p>At the end of the year I got 1st class honours and a government
scholarship for a PhD. My aims had been achieved. Dr Hadingham suggested
I write up my thesis as a conference article. I thought that was a great
idea and started work. It was at this point I spotted a bug in my
recognition code. Some of the inputs were being incorrectly ignored.
However, when fixed it the system became much less accurate - in fact
barely better than chance. I became disillusioned at this and quietly
abandoned the paper and chose a new supervisor for my PhD.</p>
