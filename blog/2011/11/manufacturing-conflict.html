<h4>Manufacturing Conflict</h4>

<p>TV news programs are increasing annoying me. Previously I have written
about their <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/news-junkets.html">disaster
junkets</a>, now I’m
ranting about their apparent need for argument. It is not so much a
matter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent:_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media">manufacturing
consent</a>
as manufacturing conflict.</p>

<p>Many Channel 4 News and BBC Breakfast broadcasts usually include at
least one segment where two people with opposing views discuss some news
item. I have also seen this on current affairs shows and Sky News - but
I don’t watch them often (to their credit I am not aware of this being
done on the main BBC news). It is claimed that they are promoting
discussion, but the impression is of a bunch of schoolchildren circling
the combatant and chanting “fight!”. Humans have an attraction to
conflict, and suggesting a controversy may gain viewers. Certainly such
an approach is prevalent on the Internet (witness
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin’s law</a>).
However, I hold news journalism to a higher standard than blogs (and I
think they consider themselves superior too). Perhaps the media is just
catering to baser instincts to fight for viewership in an increasingly
competitive news market.</p>

<p>These discussions rarely add any value to the topic at hand. The
participants are in opposition by definition (or they wouldn’t be
invited) and can’t be persuaded by a 5 minute TV confrontation. At the
rare best there is a reasonable logical exchange, although normally the
parties use all the non-logical weapons of rhetoric to win the debate.
Sometimes there is a heated argument and if the producers are lucky
enough to provoke a physical confrontation it can be covered as news
itself! Often the role of the news anchor in these segments appears to
be goading the participants.</p>

<p>There is the idea of journalistic balance, but this can be provided
without the need for argument. Instead “talent” seems more important
than reasonable, logical and most importantly truthful statements. A new
journalist once explained to me that an eloquent, presentable and
outspoken person is better “talent” - that is they come across well
onscreen. This is why the same experts appear on TV news repetitively
even to discuss areas outside their area of expertise. This is used to
advantage by politicians and PR people. Even today it is possible to
find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society">flat-earthers</a>. A
news discussion with them may imply opinions differ on the shape of the
Earth! Channel 4 often suggests viewers visit their website site after a
discussion for fact-checking. I find this strange because I watch the
news for facts, but they don’t have time to present them.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>
