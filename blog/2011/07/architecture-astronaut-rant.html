<p>Joel Spolsky has often <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/21.html">blogged his opinions on Software
Architects</a>. Those
people who design whole software environments and their tendency to
become astronauts (that is divorced from the realities on the ground). I
have a great deal of empathy with his view. Grounded architects may have
some use in large companies to set a general technical direction and aid
communication among independently working teams. In smaller groups there
is no need for them, yet they often appear. Recently I have worked on
small teams of 5-10 developers with 10-20 tasks that need to be done
immediately. At these workplaces there has been a focus on getting
things done and we have all handled our own design, relying on
professionalism to keep us all moving in the same direction. So luckily
I have avoided Software Architects for many years, but my luck is
running out - I have just encountered people ready for take-off.</p>

<p>I have some empathy for the architect - just a little. I used to have
designs on being an architect. I wanted to do things the “right way” (in
quotes because it is always a matter of opinion, with many caveats). For
a technical person it seems like the place where you can have the most
influence. It is also part of the informal software development career
path, on which I was once travelling. However, as I enjoy programming I
would help code my solutions. Thus I encountered the problems that occur
when abstract perfection meets messy reality. Solving the problem has to
come first - to paraphrase Jeff Atwood the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2004/12/it-came-from-planet-architecture.html">architecture should be
framed in the context of the
problem</a>.</p>

<p>Now I think the first priority should be solving the clients’ problem.
For the last 6 years or so I have chosen workplaces that emphasise
“getting things done”, especially since timescales are always tight. One
can make the argument that it takes time to do things right and we
should take that time. That is true, and if that is hugely important you
should probably work someplace else. Where I currently work, our
original project was to create a complete European government bond
trading platform in around 3 months. The market opportunity was fading
fast and costs were increasing. If an extra year was taken to produce a
technically beautiful solution the result would be useless as the
investment wouldn’t be recouped in a reasonable timeperiod. Corners had
to be cut and they were, but we delivered on time. Now when time allows
we can refactor the system into a better state.</p>

<p>The current architect wannabees I have encountered are ranting that the
reason they can’t get their job done is that our environment is crap
(despite being part of the team that created that environment). It needs
to be ripped up and started again the “right way”. They produce eloquent
arguments for beautiful service-oriented architectures. While I agree
that their vision is better than our reality, it in no way reflects our
reality. Worse, they are not very good coders, and they use our “wrong”
but working environment as their excuse for their messy, buggy code.
When given the chance to rework something from scratch without
dependencies on other components they still produce buggy, messy,
unreliable code that no one wants to use and took 4 times as long as the
original working version. This has happened not once, but twice! As a
result, we are further from the right way as we have to cover the other
person’s unfinished work and fight their new code, leaving us less time
for refactoring. Yet still they continue, it will all be better if we
just do everything their way. Personally, I’d rather just solve the
problem at hand - which at the moment includes them!</p>

<p>Just had to get that off my chest.</p>
