Podcasts</a></p>

<p>Moving away from the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University’s</a>
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/05/myth-at-the-heart-of-the-roman.html">Myth</a>
series, these podcasts look at how
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Rome">Rome</a> (together with its
port colony <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostia</a>) was
built and functioned. There are 14 videos in the series and one
introductory audio podcast. The podcast files are prefixed with
non-contiguous numbers, so I think that the released episodes are only
part of a larger series. The videos are in documentary format with shots
of a large model of Rome for context interspersed with contemporary
scenes of the sites and talking heads. The podcasts range from under 2
minutes (12MB) to over 11 minutes (128MB) all recorded at 640x480
resolution, or a smaller iPod optimised format. Transcripts are
available in PDF format.</p>

<p>The videos can be split in three rough categories. There are episodes on
Rome: how it was constructed,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_aqueduct">aqueducts</a>; the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurelian_Walls">Aurelanic
wall</a>; how the population
was fed; the water system; and some industry, mainly fulleries. Then
there are some podcasts on Ostia, its warehouses,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(building)">insulae</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermae">baths</a>. The last videos focus on
a couple of Rome’s monumental buildings, namely the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheon,_Rome">Pantheon</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baths_of_Caracalla">Baths
of Caracalla</a>.</p>

<p>At its peak, Rome had a population of around a million people - the
largest western city in history until London and Paris in the 18th
century. The Romans were not known for their invention, but they were
good developers of existing technology and very organised. To maintain
the large population aqueducts were used to bring in water, while sewers
took the waste out (although urine was used in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullo">fulleries</a>. Grain and other goods
were transported up the Tiber on barges from Ostia after arriving there
from around the Mediterranean. Only the rich could afford horses and
carts were banned in Rome during daylight. Thus the size of the city was
dictated by walking distance. To fit the large population the city had
to built upwards. Many people lived in apartment blocks called Insulae
(which means “island” in Latin). Upto six stories tall, the better
apartments were at the bottom, as these were nearer the water supply,
involved less stairs and were safer in the event of a fire.</p>

<p>The standard Roman building method used thin bricks combined with
concrete. This technique allowed them to build strong buildings. The
Baths of Caracalla is a massive building able to serve thousands of
bathers at a time. It had a large dome over the caldarium (hot room),
underfloor heating and furnaces and large windows (unusual in older
buildings). The Pantheon at a diameter of 43 metres is still the worlds
largest concrete dome. It is constructed using marble from all over the
world - publicly demonstrating the Emperor’s power. The portico’s 12
metre tall columns are each from a single block of stone quarried in
Egypt. Peculiarly, if the columns were 15 metres tall then the portico
would better integrate with the rotunda. It is theorized that the
columns were originally supposed to be taller, but that it was too
difficult produce and transport such columns to Rome - thus
necessitating the mismatch between portico and rotunda.</p>

<p>Many interesting details on the functioning of a Roman city -
recommended.</p>
