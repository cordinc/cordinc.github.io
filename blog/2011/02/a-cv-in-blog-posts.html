<br/><br/>
<p>My first “proper’ish” job was IT consulting for a small publisher that
shall remain nameless. I had paying work before, temping for a warehouse
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock-taking">stocktake</a> and as a teaching
assistant at university, but I never considered them jobs. In order to
provide a little structure to my memories posts I’m going to go through
my work and education experiences, starting with that publisher.</p>

<p>In early 1997 I began thinking that perhaps a PhD wasn’t right for me
and started perusing the University job board. There was a part-time
position to create an online presence for a publisher at a rate only a
student could consider acceptable. It was a perfect opportunity for me
to see what the world of work was like. Previously I thought I would
stay in academia forever. Thus in early 1997 I ended up in the one room
office of a small publisher with surprisingly high profitability based
on the back of low costs in Australia and high sales in America.</p>

<p>The firm was run by a nice middle aged couple, publishing books of what
essentially amounted to tables of data. They gave me a copy of their
latest book and I immediately saw the potential for them on the then
burgeoning web. They weren’t so interested in that, or at least they
acted cool on the idea. Instead I spent the next few weeks (a few hours
per week) hooking up the office computers to a local ISP, training
everyone on the Internet (email, web, some basic html, etc) and creating
a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brochureware">brochureware</a> web
presence. One exchange sticks in my memory. I asked about their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>. “Database, what’s
that?” “Where do you keep the data you publish?” “Oh, you mean
”Quark“:http://www.quark.com/.” It turns out they kept all the data
tables as text in their publishing system.</p>

<p>The most interested person in the office was the owner’s son. At the
time the public was just becoming aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dotcom
boom</a>. He clearly wanted to
make a mark on the world and saw the possibilities in his parents’
business. One day he said he had a great idea. We could scrape the
Internet for email addresses and send all of them ads for their books. I
told him about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)">spam</a> and
that I didn’t want to do that. There were a few other strange
conversations and I always felt a little uneasy around him.</p>

<p>The experience scared me back to my studies, but only for a while. After
sixth months, I left my PhD permanently and started fulltime at
Electrolley (but that is a whole other story). A few years later I
bumped into the son again at the shops (just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#The_bubble_bursts">dotcom
bust</a>).
He said they had employed a few students to build a site for the
publisher and it was going well. No mention of the other stuff. I
checked out their site and it did indeed look good and useful. For a fee
you could subscribe to the site and get personalised access to their
data. I looked again just before writing this and they still exist and
have gone even farther, with more features including most recently
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad">iPad</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>
apps. Yet I have never regretted leaving.</p>
