<h4>Too Many States</h4>

<p>No, I’m not agitating for Tasmania to have its statehood revoked.
Instead I want simpler state machines in programming. I’m a fan of the
model of programming where the core of the system is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine">state
machine</a> firing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming">events</a> on state
transitions. Listeners on those events then perform actions, possibly
changing the state themselves. It doesn’t fit every scenario, but it
works well in those places it can be applied.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on a few such systems and a major determinant of eventual
success is the complexity of the state machine. Sometimes this
complexity is caused by the state machine encoding multiple state flows.
The system would be simpler with a set of separate discrete state
machines, each with a distinct main flow. I think software engineers can
get obsessed with trying to find a single comprehensive solution to a
problem. This can blind them to seeing a more understandable solution by
breaking the system into smaller parts.</p>

<p>Below is a state diagram similar to one I saw recently at the start of a
project (I have actually simplified it a little, removing domain
specific states and transitions for anonymity).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/complex.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>This doesn’t look right to me. Multiple start and end states, a loop,
and if a few more error states are added the diagram starts looking like
a spiderweb. Diagrams which have allowed designers/developers to express
their artistic side (I once saw one in the shape of a phone) are a good
sign that there may be too many states. In this domain there are really
three interlocking flows which have just been placed together. Each of
the three flows represents the state of communication with a different
external system. There is no need for them to be combined. It makes more
sense to separate them. Looking at this, and with a bit of domain
knowledge (just trust me), it can be equivalently expressed by the
diagram below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/simple.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>I think this is much better. It involves a few more states in total, but
each individual flow is easier to understand. The domain object holding
the current state now has three state variables rather than one. The
state of the whole system is now the combination of these three state
variables. This more accurately describes the current state and adds
more flexibility for adding new states or transitions later. It is also
possible to split the transition listeners into one for each flow, thus
making them more focused events.</p>

<p>There are a few differences between the two state diagrams above. The
three flows will have some interaction and the extra states are there to
aid this. For example, the middle flow shouldn’t go to the <strong>Process</strong>
state until either <strong>Enrich</strong> or <strong>Response Received</strong> has been reached.
In the simplified diagram there are added <strong>Init</strong> and <strong>Pending</strong>
states to act as placeholders while waiting for other events to occur.
All three state variables start in the <strong>Init</strong> state, and as events
occur they move on independently. The event that moves the middle flow
on to <strong>Process</strong> is the event fired after one of the other flow’s
transitions.</p>

<p>In 14 years how many times has decomposing a complex state diagram been
beneficial on my projects? Three. Is it guaranteed to work? No. Will it
work for you? Maybe. Think about it next time you find yourself staring
at a complex state diagram.</p>
