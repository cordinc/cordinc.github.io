<h4>Timewatch: Murder in Rome</h4>

<p>Available on <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-4229362271242931182">Google
Video</a></p>

<p>Murder in Rome is not a podcast like I normally review. It is a TV
program produced by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> as part of its
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjlw">Timewatch</a> history
documentary series (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0954240/">IMDB entry</a>).
Copies of the video are easily found through an online search; I watched
the version (obviously a TV capture) that has been on Google Video for
three years, so is presumably legit. The show is 46 minutes long and the
story is told mainly through an acted reconstruction of historical
events. There is occasional documentary style narration to provide
context - viewers with little background information will not get lost.
The acting is good, if you watch much British TV you will no doubt
recognise a few of the actors.</p>

<p>The show is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero">Cicero’s</a>
defence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Roscius">Sextus Roscius</a> - accused of murdering his father in 81BC. Cicero went on to become a
consul and prominent figure in the fall of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Republic</a>. Many of
Cicero’s writings from this time still exist, including his account of
this trial (<a href="http://www.uah.edu/student_life/organizations/SAL/texts/latin/classical/cicero/proamerino1e.html">available
here</a>).
The script is primarily drawn from this source. Some other references
are found in a list of known Roman trials <a href="http://indigo.lib.uic.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/10027/99/8/Alexander.Trials.pdf">available here as trial
number
129</a>.</p>

<p>Rome in 81BC was under the dictatorship of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla">Sulla</a> after a
civil war. Sulla <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscription">proscribed</a>
perceived enemies of the state. According to Wikipedia, up to 9000
people (mainly nobles) were executed without trial as part of the
proscriptions and had their property seized. It was in this environment
of fear and extra-judicial killings that the trial takes place. So when
Cicero starts claiming that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Chrysogonus">Chrysogonus</a>,
the man in charge of the proscriptions, is the more likely murderer, I
can imagine the concern shown is real.</p>

<p>The process of the trial is somewhat similar to modern trials, but
definitely foreign (details on Roman litigation can be found
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_litigation#Formulary_system">here</a>).
Familiar components are present such as a judge, jury, witnesses and
lawyers representing both sides. There seems to be an emphasis on
justice as a desirable outcome in Cicero’s defence. However, there are
glaring differences to modern trials (at least in the western world).
Prosecutions are brought by individuals rather than the state, even for
murder. To prevent false accusations and spurious trials, if a
prosecutor loses then they are branded on the forehead with a K (for
kalumnia, meaning “false accuser”). The trials are held in the open in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Romanum">Forum</a>, and in the
program attracts a vocal crowd of onlookers. The process seems to rely
more on rhetoric than evidence. This is no CSI: Ancient Rome. Witnesses
are insulted if the lawyers disagree. Cicero even takes issue with
Chrysogonus’ “curled and perfumed” hair. There are no
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objection_(law)">objections</a> or
protests.</p>

<p>I can’t speak to the historical accuracy of the program, but couldn’t
find any errors after a few online searches. I was particularly glad to
see that the buildings shown had some colour on them rather than the
common and incorrect pure white (ancient Roman buildings are white now
because the paint has disappeared over time). As for the accuracy of the
trial itself, it depends how much you trust Cicero’s account.</p>

<p>Excellent, well worth a watch.</p>
