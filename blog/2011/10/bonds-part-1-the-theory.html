</ul>

<p>For the last six years I have developed software for the bonds desks of
Investment Banks (usually the European Government Bonds desk). Now it is
time to move on into a different business area. So I have decided to
write some notes on the business and software of bond trading as I have
witnessed it - starting here with the basics.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)">bond</a> is
basically a loan that can be traded. Imagine company X needs a billion
dollars to buy another firm. The company issues 1000 bonds each with a
face value of a million dollars (also known as nominal value), which
totals to the required billion dollars. These bonds are then sold to
banks and other large entities. The bonds have a maturity date 10 years
in the future and an annual coupon rate of 5. On the maturity date the
issuer will pay the holder of the bond (whoever that is) the face value
of the bond, a million dollars in this case. In addition every year on
the anniversary of issuing the bonds, company X will pay the current
holder of the bond a coupon payment - 5 of the value of the bond, which
is $50,000. This is essentially the interest rate company X is paying to
borrow the money. The people who get the coupon payments and the
maturity payment do not need to be the same people. The bonds can be
bought or sold at any time for any price. It is similar to a mortgage,
if the bank could sell the debt to someone else and your repayments went
to the new owner (this actually happens - see
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortgage-backed_security">MBS</a>, but that
is a little out of my area). The first transfer of ownership, from the
issuer to the purchaser, is called the “primary market”. Any subsequent
sales occur in the “secondary market”.</p>

<p>The instrument described above is a standard <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bulletbond.asp">bullet
bond</a>. It is called
a bullet bond because before bond administration was done
electronically, the physical bond paper had little tear-away tabs for
each coupon payment, and these tabs were know as bullets. Military (and
sports) metaphors are common in banking. However, there are numerous
different categories and types of bonds. The biggest split is between
Corporates/Credit and Rates. Company issued bonds are considered
Corporates or Credit and government issued bonds are Rates. Inside all
the banks I know about, the two are always separate from a business
standpoint (different traders sitting as physically distinct desks) and
sometimes so is the supporting technology, but not necessarily. As I
have always worked officially with Rates, only incidentally being
involved with Credit, the rest of this series will lean heavily towards
the world of government debt.</p>

<p>Rates are often further split by business type into separate desks. Here
by desks I just mean an organisationally distinct group of traders that
have supposed responsibility for a type of security. Although that won’t
stop a trader transacting in other securities, just that their desk
defines their focus or specialty. The desks themselves can be further
subdivided, but more on that in the next post.</p>

<p>US government bonds are called Treasuries, and they normally have their
own desk of traders (usually based in New York). There is the Gilts desk
for British government bonds, and the European Government Debt desk
(also known as the EGB or Eurogovvy desk) for dealers of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone">Eurozone</a> bonds. Depending on
the size of the bank there may also be desks of traders for emerging
markets, supras/agencies (debt issued by non-government organisations
that is guaranteed by governments - like the <a href="http://www.ebrd.com/pages/homepage.shtml">European Development
Bank</a> or <a href="http://www.fanniemae.com/portal/index.html">Fannie
Mae</a>) or even sometimes a
Scandi desk just for the Scandanavian countries. There is also often a
desk of just a trader or two for linkers - inflation-linked bonds where
the return is derived from the inflation rate in a country.</p>

<p>Derivatives based on rates bonds also have their own desks - futures,
swaps, options, and more. I have had little to do with these desks other
than where they interact with bonds desks. Credit also breaks itself
into different desks, but I have never interacted with them.</p>

<p>Beyond just different issuers there is also an entire spectrum of
different types. Bullet bonds (as used above in examples) is the most
common type of bond I have encountered. However, there are many more.
Each requires a different calculation to determine their price and have
different levels of popularity. Below is a list of some I have
encountered on rates desks. There are many more types than listed here.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Floating Rate Bonds or floaters - the coupon payments of these bonds
is not set in advance, but instead floats. The amount paid is
determined by some algorithm based on the financial environment at
the time (ie. central bank rate + 1%).</li>
  <li>Inflation Linked Bonds or linkers - A type of floating rate bond
where the coupon payment is based on an inflation rate.</li>
  <li>Zero Coupon Bonds - bonds which make no coupon payments.</li>
  <li>Perpetual Bonds or perps - bonds that never payback the nominal
value and just continue paying coupons forever. There are a few of
these issued by the UK government hundreds of years ago and the
holders still collect the coupon payments every year.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are more common on credit desks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Callable or Putable Bonds - bonds where the issuer (for callables)
or the holder (for putables) can call in the debt under certain
conditions - thus forcing payment of the nominal and ending coupon
payments.</li>
  <li>Asset Backed Bonds - bonds where the nominal and coupon payments are
based on the returns on some asset, for instance pools of mortgages.</li>
  <li>Convertible Bonds - bonds where the debt can be converted into
company shares under certain conditions.</li>
</ul>

<p>A hugely important part of bond trading is knowing what the bonds are
worth. In this respect bonds have an advantage over other security types
like equities and currencies - the cash flows to the bond holder are
known in advance. Thus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cash_flow">Discounted Cash Flow
(DCF)</a> technique can
be used to price the bond. From the bullet bond example above, we know
that it returns its nominal value ($1M) in 10 years (on the maturity
date) and that every year (because the coupon frequency is annual) it
also returns a coupon payment of $50K (as the coupon rate is 5% of the
nominal). Thus the cash flows of the bond after purchasing it on issue
are:</p>

<p>Using DCF and setting the discount rate to the current US Federal
Reserve Base Rate of 0.25% gives the present value of the bond as
$1,468,534. Thus suggesting a buyer of the bond at issue would be
willing to pay upto that amount for it. The interest rate a bond
returns, known as its yield, is different to its coupon rate. In the
example above, purchasing the bond at issue for $1,468,534 means a yield
of 0.25, despite a coupon rate of 5. If $1,000,000 is paid for the bond
at issue, then the yield will be 5%, the same as the coupon. So price
and yield are correlated, but the coupon is unchanging. The only thing
that matters are the cash flows associated with holding the bond and the
appropriate yield curve (that is, the expected interest rates). Thus the
price of a bond drops, its yield increases and vice versa (a common
entry-level interview question in Fixed Income technology). Astute
readers will immediately see two problems: the choice of discount rate;
and the risk of bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The risk that the issuer of the bond may not repay the debt is known as
the credit risk. The higher the credit risk the more likely the issuer
won’t pay, thus the lower the price of the bond and the higher the rate
the issuer has to offer to tempt buyers. Levels of credit risk are
categorised by the grades produced by ratings agencies. So other things
being equal, a AAA rated bond is worth more than a C rated bond.
Countries are generally considered safer than companies, so they pay
less of a credit risk premium. However, countries themselves can vary in
perceived risk. In the Eurozone, the spread (or difference) over German
10-year bonds (also known as bunds) is the standard measure of perceived
risk - as Germany is seen as very likely to repay its debt (it is rated
AAA). At the moment <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GDBR10:IND">German 10-year
bonds</a> yield
1.95% while <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GGGB10YR:IND">Greek 10-year
bonds</a> yield
23.02% (unrated due to likelihood of default) and the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GFRN10:IND">French 10-year
rate</a> is 2.66%
(AAA rated). The Greek spread is 21.07% or 2107 basis points (1%=100
basis points), while for France it is 71 basis points. As both are in
the Eurozone, both have their bonds denominated in the same currency and
thus their post-issue value is driven by the same
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Central_Bank">ECB</a> interest rate.
So the price difference is largely a measure of risk. Unsurprisingly,
Greece is seen as incredibly more likely to default than France. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_default_swap">Credit
Default Swaps (CDS)</a>
are securities to insure against credit risk, but they do not seem to be
used much by EGB traders.</p>

<p>The issue with the discount rate is that in reality it is unlikely to
remain static for all but the shortest maturity bonds. Instead a
changing interest rate needs to be used that accounts for predicted
changes in rates. Luckily such a projection of future interest rates
exists - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_curve">yield curve</a>.
The rates to use when discounting a government bond’s cash flows is
determined by a yield curve for the bond’s currency. Below is an example
yield curve. As can be seen, the rate changes with time, typically with
an upward slope.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_curve"><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/18/USD_yield_curve_09_02_2005.JPG/320px-USD_yield_curve_09_02_2005.JPG" alt="Yield Curve" title="Yield Curve" /></a></p>

<p>The process of constructing a yield curve is known as bootstrapping.
First find a set of instruments with maturities that correspond to
desired
<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tenor.asp#axzz1ZFzOttdb">tenors</a> on
the curve (a tenor is just a period of time, eg 1 day or 3 months or 15
years). These instruments tend to be the most
<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/liquidasset.asp#axzz1ZFzOttdb">liquid</a>
(effectively the instruments with the most volume available for buying
or selling) at the desired tenors. This usually means derivatives of
various flavours are used (why this the case is explained in the next
post). The interest rate implied by the market price of the chosen
instruments becomes a point on the curve. The actual curve is then
interpolated from these points (a process known as bootstrapping).</p>

<p>Over the short term bonds tend to trade at a set spread to their yield
curve. That is its yield is not exactly on the curve, but at a small
distance from it, the size of this distance is the spread. This spread
represents the credit risk and any other issues (eg. liquidity) that
affect the value of the bond beyond interest rate expectations.</p>

<p>The value of a bond also depends on when the coupon payment is due. A
bond is worth more the day before a coupon payment (as the next day the
purchaser will get the payment) than the day after (when the purchaser
won’t get the payment). The amount the coupon payments change the price
is known as accrued interest. Traders don’t like to calculate how much
of an affect the coupon payments have on a price. Thus for the purposes
of trading the price is stripped of accrued interest. The price with the
coupon effect included is called the dirty price and with it excluded is
the clean price. The rough diagram below shows how these concepts are
related.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/clean_dirty.png" title="Clean Price vs Dirty Price" width="500" alt="Clean Price vs Dirty Price" /></p>

<p>The price calculated may be the actual value of the bond, but it is not
where banks want to trade. They want to buy low and sell high. The price
at which they will buy is the bid, and the price at which they will sell
is the ask (or offer) price. The calculated price is known as the mid
price as it is normally halfway between the bid and ask. If it isn’t
halfway then the actual halfway point is known as the skewed mid and the
difference between that and the calculated mid is known as the skew.
Skews are not often applied in my experience and only if the trader is
particularly keen to do a certain trade. The difference between the bid
and ask is called the spread (not to be confused with the spread off the
yield curve - also known as the spread). The wider the spread, the worse
the prices as the further they are from the calculated value of a bond.
The bid and the ask prices are sent out to a market by the bank as the
prices at which they are willing to trade - the mid is kept hidden. The
process of publishing the prices is known as quoting. When quoting, the
total nominal value of the bonds willing to be bought or sold as part of
the quote is known as the volume.</p>

<p>For example, if a bond has a calculated price of $100, this is the mid.
If the trader uses a spread of $1, then the prices quoted are
99.50/100.50. If the mid then moves to $100.50, then the quote is
100/101. If a skew of –0.5 is applied then the quote becomes 99.5/100.5
again (but the mid is still 100.5). If the spread is then widened to 2,
the the quote is 99/101.</p>

<p>When working out whether or not a bond trade has made money the term PnL
is used (short for “Profit and Loss”). There are two types: realized and
unrealized. Realized PnL is the actual cash flow coming from a trade. If
you have some bonds and sell all of them, then the price difference
between the buy and sell multiplied by the number of bonds is the
realized PnL. Thus if you have 1000 bonds bought at $100 and sell 500 at
$99 then your realized PnL is -$500 (-$1 per bond for 500 bonds), so you
made a loss. Unrealized PnL is the amount of realized PnL that would be
made if your holdings are sold at current market rates. Thus if you have
1000 bonds bought at $100 and now the market price is $101, although
your realized PnL is 0 (as they haven’t been sold), your unrealized PnL
is $1000. Calculating the unrealized PnL by comparing the price paid
against the market price is known as “marking to market”, and is easy in
the liquid government bond market. A trader’s PnL is considered the sum
of their realized and unrealized and is usually quoted on the basis of
the difference day-by-day. So if a trader says their PnL is down $100K,
it usually means so far they are down $100K that day.</p>

<p>After determining a bond’s price, measuring its risk is the next most
important concept. The traders need to have some idea of how the value
of their positions (that is the bonds in which they are long or short)
will change when the market moves. The most common measure of this is
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_duration#Dollar_duration.2C_DV01">DV01</a>,
which describes the amount a bond’s price will change given a 1 basis
point change in yield. DV01 is similar to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_duration">duration</a> and gives an
indication of a bond’s sensivity to changes in the yield curve. DV01 is
technically only for US dollar bonds. PV01 is the same concept for other
currencies (or even other security types), but on EGB desks the terms
are used interchangeably (same with pvbp). To get the risk of a
position, just multiply the net position by DV01. So if you own
$10,000,000 of a bond with a DV01 of 0.02578, then you can expect the
value of your bonds to go down approximation $25,780 for each basis
point rise in yield (and vice-versa). It should be noted the above is a
simplification, as the calculation only works for small changes in
yield. Larger changes need to take into account
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_convexity">convexity</a>, but that is
beyond this discussion (and I’ve rarely needed that information).</p>

<p>There are numerous other theoretical concepts in fixed income. There are
large books devoted to understanding the myriad of derivatives based on
bonds. However, the above are the fundamentals as I experienced them.
Other concepts or maths came and went as required, but from a technology
standpoint I often needed to understand the different types of bond,
risk and valuation.</p>
