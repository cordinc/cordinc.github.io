</ul>

<p>When I first interviewed for a technology job in fixed income, I knew
the “basics” and explained how to do a discounted cash flow analysis to
price a bond. The interviewer smiled and said yes, that was the correct
way to price a bond, but that wasn’t how it was done in practice.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The reality of EGB trading is strongly influenced by the markets used to
trade. If one wants to trade bonds there are two options:
Dealer-to-Client (D2C) markets; and, Dealer-to-Dealer (D2D) markets. D2C
markets (like Bloomberg or Tradeweb) are where dealers (usually the
banks) quote prices on bonds for clients like fund managers or insurance
companies to buy or sell. On D2D markets (MTS is the main one in Europe)
the big banks can trade with each other and smaller players (even hedge
funds) are not allowed to participate. The two types of market work
quite differently.</p>

<p>On D2C markets trading is a negotiation. When a potential client wants
to buy or sell a bond they send a Request For Quotes (RFQ). This RFQ can
go to a specfic bank or multiple banks at once and starts a negotiation
process. The banks send back their quotes and the client chooses one
quote or makes a counter offer and so on until the price is agreed and
the trade done or alternatively no agreement is reached and the RFQ
canceled. Banks can send prices to the markets (know as quotes), but
these are usually just indicative - that is a price at which they are
likely, but not necessarily, willing to trade. It is like advertising.
RFQs ensure that trade is done at a price with which the trader (and
client) is happy. Thus they should be profitable for the bank unless
there is an error somewhere or are intentionally done at a bad price
(perhaps as a favour to a client or to offload a large position). Some
D2C markets allow “firm pricing”, where the quoted prices should be
executable - that is the published price is the final price, no
negotiation involved. However, they are not really executable and the
trader still gets a last look to ensure the firm price is good (the
downside is that if they reject too many firm price trades the market
will stop them sending firm prices). To get around the possibility of a
bad trade with firm prices the traders send quotes with wider spreads
than for indicative prices (ie. the prices are worse than might
otherwise be available). Banks almost never send RFQs on D2C markets.
The spreads are tighter (and thus the prices better) on the D2D markets.</p>

<p>Government bonds can also be traded on D2D markets (but not corporates).
The main D2D market in Europe is <a href="http://www.mtsmarkets.com/">MTS</a>.
There are a few others, but MTS is by far the biggest. D2D markets use
strictly executable quotes. If a price is quoted and someone else trades
at that price, then the trade is done - no negotiation or last look. The
terminology is that if your quote is traded then you have been lifted,
if you trade on someone else’s quote then you have hit them - although
at times I have heard the terms used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Executable quotes make the D2D markets a very different place for
traders. If a trader is quoting an incorrect price and it is lifted then
they lose money with no chance of avoidance (other than not having a bad
price). The likelihood of having bad prices hit is very high as all the
other market participants are sophisticated traders - other large banks.
Generally if some other bank is initiating a trade with you then you are
getting the worst of it. There is little motivation for them to lift
your quote if it is the correct price (unless they are trying to move
inventory or have an error of their own). Most traders hate quoting on
the D2D markets.</p>

<p>So why do banks quote on D2D markets? Partly it is because quoting is
seen as integral to being a “real bank” and that the D2D markets gives
banks access to government bonds cheaper than D2C markets. However, the
main reason is they are forced to quote. European governments like to
have liquid secondary markets in their bonds. If potential buyers know
that their government bonds can be easily resold, then the initial price
they are willing to pay at issue increases. Thus governments can pay a
lower rate of interest. To get the banks to quote in the D2D markets,
European governments have set up the primary dealership program. Banks
can apply to become a primary dealer in a country’s debt. The number of
primary dealers is generally restricted, so only large international
banks and the country’s own banks tend to be approved. The largest
recent change in primary dealers was around 2008-09 when some large
banks disappeared:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers">Lehmans</a> went bust; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bear_Stearns">Bear
Stearns</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch">Merrill
Lynch</a> were merged into
other firms. This allowed a couple of smaller banks like
<a href="http://www.rbc.com/country-select.html">RBC</a> and
<a href="http://www.jefco.com/">Jefferies</a> to take up primary dealerships across
Europe.</p>

<p>Primary dealers are required to quote on the D2D markets. This is called
their “obligations”. The government bestowing primary dealership will
sent a list of bonds every month together with the length of time they
should be quoted, the maximum spread they should be quoted and the
minimum volume to quote. For example, the French government may say that
its primary dealers should quote a set of 50 French government bonds for
at least four hours per day at a spread no greater than 50 basis points
and at volume of at least 10 million.</p>

<p>The primary dealers are ranked each month on how well they did at
meeting their obligation requirements. This ranking then feeds into the
bidding process on government bond auctions. When European governments
issue new bonds, they do so at auctions where only primary dealers can
bid. The government will state the characteristics of the new bond and
banks then bid what they are willing to pay for them. Normally when
primary dealers buy bonds at issue they can immediately sell them at a
profit on the D2C markets. The gains made at auction (together with the
prestige of being a primary dealer) make up for the occasions when
quotes are lifted. Although a trader might not see it that way when they
have been hit a few times in quick succession.</p>

<p>So far all the trading has been done electronically. That is the trade
is completed between computers under human instruction. No <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_outcry">open
outcry</a> like in old films of
the stockmarket. A trader in London may trade with someone in a
different country who they have never met or even spoken. In fact the
nature of the markets make this very likely. At one former employer, a
trader calculated that he had made a large amount of money off one
particular person at a competing bank and joked he should send them a
Christmas card, but he didn’t know their real name (only their market
login nickname).</p>

<p>Some trades on the D2C markets still have a human touch. However, this
is not from the traders. Alongside the traders (although organised into
their own desks) are the salespeople. They work to drum up business. The
salespeople themselves aren’t allowed to trade (in London you have to be
licensed by the <a href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/">FSA</a>), the actual trade
execution has to be done by a proper trader. The salespeople try to
think up trade ideas for the bank’s clients. Essentially justifiction
for the client to trade with them. Simplistically, this is of the form,
“if you do X I think you’ll make money”, although I heard rumours
sometimes trades are done more as favours.</p>

<p>I have had very little to do with sales desks. So I can’t give more than
a basic description of their function. I have noticed that sales desks
tend to have a higher percentage of women than other front office areas.
There also tends to be higher proportion of young’ish good looking
people in such teams. Perhaps it makes persuasion easier. On government
bond trading desks across 3 different banks, I have yet to meet a single
trader who was female and only two who were from an ethnic minority
(both East Asian) - otherwise they have all been white European men.
This is less the case in other teams. I get the impression that the
number of minorities on a trading desk is inversely related to the age
of the business of the desk. Government bond trading desks tend to have
been around for decades and is definitely a boys club. The newer
corporate desks are more varied and the recent ABS/MBS traders were
about half minorities - at two places I worked they were run by women.</p>

<p>Trading tends to be a young man’s game. Most of the traders I worked
with were in their early 30’s, with the occasional guy younger or older.
However, most of them were younger than they looked! The stress and
early mornings weren’t doing them any favours. A trader’s basic salary
tends to be a small part of their overall remuneration. Most of their
pay comes in an end of year bonus that is driven largely by PnL. A
trader roughly expects some (usually single digit) percentage of their
PnL to be paid as their bonus. They monitor their PnL constantly
throughout the day. So there is realtime feedback on how well they are
doing their job (making money) and know that will directly affect their
remuneration. In addition, EGB traders in London start trading at 7am,
as that is when the markets in Europe open. Most are sitting at their
desks 15-30 minutes before then. Lunch is normally eaten at their desk,
only juniors seem to spend significant time away from the desk. EGB
traders could always be found during the day staring at their 6 or so
computer screens. The trading day ends at 4:30pm London time, but after
that is administrative work and meetings - getting out around 5:30pm
would be a good day. Very long days - although not as long as I hear
investment bankers endure.</p>

<p>Constant financial feedback and long stressful days don’t lead naturally
to emotional stability. I found traders often at extremes - either very
happy or angry. If they were calm it didn’t take much to tip them over.
The stereotype of the shouty trader certainly has a basis in reality
around the EGB desk - if they are losing money. Of course when making
money they were nice people. Most of the time I have been working with
EGB desks they have been profitable, and the traders generally pleasant.
Although, before talking to a trader I (and many others) would first
check if they were making money that day. If they were up we would pop
around and have a chat. If they were down on the day then we would avoid
them.</p>

<p>I have many personal or second-hand stories of highly strung traders at
work. However, I have no stories of post-work shenanigans. I never
socialised with the traders outside of work, both because I was never
invited and I was never interested. Traders shouting and swearing at
people is such a standard occurrence the experienced support person soon
barely notices it, unless it is extreme or continuous. Dismissive and
demanding behaviour was also common. Traders run the place and look
after themselves. One trader was well known for demanding that support
or a developer come see them immediately, but once they had arrived
telling them he was busy and making them wait 5 or 10 minutes before
making his normally non-urgent request. Trader’s often seem to have a
compressed sense of time. When estimating duration they would grossly
overestimate. Most support people would smirk at the concept of a
“trader minute”, which actually is only a few seconds long (ie “my
prices were wrong for minutes!”). Another time I was sitting with a
support person while trying to solve a trader’s problem with a market
(it was the market’s fault). Nearly every minute the trader would call
ask for a progress update and when it would be fixed. The support person
always replied with the accurate and decreasing time estimate, after
which the trader would tell them to fix it now (and not in a nice
manner). I could see no way that the problem could be fixed faster than
the support person was managing. At least the trader didn’t storm around
and stand over the support person until the issue was resolved (which I
have seen happen).</p>

<p>Losing money really aggravates a trader, especially if they don’t see it
as their fault (which is nearly always). I’ve heard traders demand we
have a trade reversed on the market, even though they know we can’t do
that. Once a trader demanded that we have the market open early so he
could cover some positions (also not possible, we told him to just wait
the 5 minutes until 7am). I’ve also heard of a trader reaching into a
support person’s pocket to get their wallet in order recover a loss on a
trade - although he was just kidding and returned the wallet back
unmolested.</p>

<p>Traders also compete with their colleagues to protect their personal
PnL. Underperforming traders are often let go - that is a given. Also,
within an EGB desk traders are organised by seniority. The most senior
EGB trader is normally responsible for bonds around the 10-year mark as
that is the most profitable part of the EGB yield curve. Developers are
seen as a cost, but if we do something to generate profit it is hidden
in the trader’s PnL. At one bank we wrote a simple automatic trading
system that we believed worked quite well - certainly it was doing a
large amount of business and the traders praised it. When this system
traded it did so as one of the existing traders as this is required by
the FSA, so any PnL gain went to that trader. We told the traders we
would break out the PnL for the automatic system so they could see how
it was performing - and provide the technology team with a little good
PR. The traders were insistent that we shouldn’t do that. I believe the
main reason (and I wasn’t the only one) was to ensure we didn’t try to
claim some of the profit for ourselves (but as a contractor I didn’t get
a bonus anyway).</p>

<p>Traders are just the tip of the pyramid - there are a large number of
people supporting them. There are the aforementioned salespeople feeding
business to traders. Research people produce reports on the current
financial environment with forecasts. Quants are the highly mathematical
people (usually with a PhD) creating financial models or tools.
Sometimes the previous roles merge to some degree - eg a mathematical
research person who also does some sales. While EGB traders are often
decent mathematicians in their own right (all I know have quantitative
science or engineering degrees), quants are usually better. There are
various support teams - normally there is a desk of technical support
people dedicated to the bond desks. In addition there are phone support,
desktop support (for machine problems), marketdata support (for data
feeds from the market) and others that handle queries across the whole
company. Sometimes support people from external companies (like
Bloomberg or Reuters) are also available onsite. Bloomberg was
particularly known for typically hiring very attractive young women and
sending them to clients as support - the traders were always nice to
them! Software developers also do second or third line support if a
problem arose with our systems. There always had to be someone around
during market hours to field queries. So at each of the three places I
worked there was a duty roster for 7am starts and being on-call out of
office hours.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes there were also various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_office">middle
office</a> (risk and control)
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back_office">back office</a> (compliance,
trade settlement &amp; clearance) teams. Although these people often sat in
different buildings and I only occasionally conversed with them via
email or over the phone. Most IT people were classed as back office, but
those of us who interacted directly with traders (and sometimes sat on
the trading floor) were placed in Front Office IT, a half-way house.
Everyone wants to be attached to a profit centre rather than a cost
centre. That made most difference to the permanent employees and their
bonus, though still probably at least an order of magnitude or two less
than the true front office “money makers”.</p>

<p>Front office people are also required by the FSA to take 2 weeks
consecutive leave in order to make fraud harder (which included me at 2
of the 3 places I worked). In public this was taken begrudgingly, but in
private people were happy for it. Most front office (or teams that
aspired to front office status) espoused a hard-working, hard-charging
image. We also had to complete various risk and compliance courses
(normally given and tested online). These were universally considered a
joke - passing required little more than remembering that stealing is
wrong.</p>
