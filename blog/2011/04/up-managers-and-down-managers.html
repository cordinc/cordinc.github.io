<h4>Up Managers and Down Managers</h4>

<p>I read articles on the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/8-habits-of-highly-effective-google-managers-2011-3">Habits Of Highly Effective Google
Managers</a>
with some interest. Empowering, coaching, communicating - sounds like
they want classic “Down” managers. Down managers are those who focus on
the employees working for them. I have had a few good Down managers and
they create a great working environment (and often a sense of loyalty).
Google apparently focuses on retaining employees and keeping them happy,
but is this all that is required? In any large organisation, politics
plays a major role, especially with setting priorities and allocating
budgets. This is the realm of the “Up” manager. Up managers focus on the
people above them in the management hierarchy and navigate company
bureaucracy. A good Up manager will ensure their projects get
recognition and resources.</p>

<p>Many developers lack respect for Up managers. When starting my career, I
considered them parasites more interested in their own success than the
success of the team. However, after being caught in the crossfire of
senior management politics a few times with no Up manager for
protection, I now think they are vital. At one investment bank, I was in
a very successful development team with a good Down person as team
leader and an Up person as team manager. I didn’t think we needed the
manager and then he left. Problems immediately began to trickle down
from up the hierarchy. It seems various senior managers wanted our
responsibilities and budget, some managers I had never heard about
before even claimed our success as their own. For two years, our old Up
manager had kept them all at bay. With him gone the team was torn apart
within months and I left (along with most of the team). Similar events
have occurred at two other employers.</p>

<p>The best management combines both Up and Down styles. Unfortunately this
combination is rarely found with any competence in one person. People
seem to naturally gravitate to one style of management or the other
based on personal preference or ability. Trying to do both normally ends
up in both being done badly. I have seen many try (usually under duress
or desperate circumstances), but only one succeed. More realistically
two managers working in conjunction is best - one Up and one Down. That,
or work in an organisation so small there is no up to manage!</p>
