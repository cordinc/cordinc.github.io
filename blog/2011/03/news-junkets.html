<h4>News Junkets</h4>

<p>When news of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Sendai_earthquake">last week’s earthquake in
Japan</a> first broke,
the details and images were largely provided by Japanese media sources.
After a couple of days this changed - the UK media had arrived! These
newsreaders added nothing to the coverage. They stood in front of
devastation and read the news, as opposed to sitting in a London studio
and reading the news. They are just talking heads, what difference does
it make where they are physically. The same goes for reporters
parachuted in to Japan (I hesitate to call them journalists considering
their output so far). One reporter after being asked how hard it would
be to evacuate, said he had no idea, he had only been in the country a
few hours. Why did he bother? The UK media people just seem to be adding
“colour” and making comments on ethnic stereotypes (“aren’t the Japanese
calm and stoic”).</p>

<p>Why does this disaster migration occur? Is it delusion, that the
UK-based reporters can provide a better new service if they are there?
Perhaps it is self-importance, that an important story requires
important newsreaders to give it weight? Alternatively: a junket;
profile building; to give an air of authority; or, to provide a more
interesting slant to a downbeat story? They add nothing and must
subtract a great deal. I can only imagine they are in the way of the
rescue effort for a start, and consuming resources (water, food,
housing, power, etc) that could be more charitably utilised.</p>

<p>All the major news programs in the UK seem to be doing this type of
reportage - Channel 4 have at least 3 unproductive reporters in Japan
right now (not including their production teams). They must have racked
up the frequent flyer points after arriving fresh from Libya and Egypt.
Perhaps the reason the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12702130">growing crisis in the Ivory
Coast</a> is being largely
ignored is because the reporters can’t get visas. This travel can come
across as hypocritical. Jon Snow took a trip to Brazil for reports on
global warming in advance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference">Copenhagen climate
summit</a>
(he was heading in the wrong direction for a start). While there I
didn’t see him do anything that couldn’t have been done by a local
reporter. Back in Europe the next week for the summit itself, his
reports noted the increasing evidence that flying is becoming a notable
cause of global warming - like sending a news crew half way around the
world for no good reason!</p>

<p>Am I missing something? I can’t believe that the audience need this
travel to occur to be interested in stories of disaster or revolution.
It just seems pointless and ego-boosting.</p>
