    <p>The last month has been quite a busy one; I went on holiday and work is
keeping me busy. However, I need to keep things going and not let large
time gaps discourage me, so here is an update.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alpha testing going slowly. There are a number of regression bugs
from my occasionally drastic functionality changes and these tend to
stop things for a day or so (I find heroku is too slow to edit
online, so I have to fix it at home and upload). At this point the
Test Driven Development people are probably having a laugh at me and
rightly so. In my defence I am still deciding how various features
should work so there is a great deal of change occurring.</li>
  <li>My design skills are as bad as I thought according to the alpha
tester - this will definitely become a problem later.</li>
  <li>I have taken up golf and poker in the last few weeks and I’m
spending time learning. It’s a great deal of fun, as I seem to have
picked up the basics of both fairly quickly. I aim to write more on
these in future.</li>
  <li>I must find more time to work on my project! I’m also setting a goal
of at least one blog post per week.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also learnt a bit about web advertising and SEO through this blog.
Up until the Ultrasphinx post very few people visited this blog. Since
that post I get around 5 people a day, with a couple of spikes to 10 in
one day. Most of these people come from google searches (check it out),
only read the ultrasphinx page, and tend not to stay long. However, a
surprising number of them visit again. I have to admit to a little fear
and trepidation when I first saw the explosion (albeit highly targeted)
in readership. I wasn’t sure what to write. Should I write more
technical articles, as that is what drives people to this blog, or just
continue as before. The lack of technical things to write about made the
decision for me, although I do double-check my spelling now.</p>

<p>In any case the extra readership hasn’t made any difference to my ad
clicks or google page rank. Google still classifies cordinc.com as low
popularity. No one has clicked an ad since the first week of the blog,
earning me a grand total of US14cents. I had originally thought that my
project could be funded by ads, but I’m not so sure now. I don’t think
there is as much money in it as before so I may need to rethink the
business model. Perhaps it’s best just to get the system finished first.</p>

    <p>I reached a milestone in my project progress yesterday. I have just put
a very crude version of my app out for alpha testing. Unfortunately this
is three weeks later than I had originally planned back in January. At
that time I was hoping to do an alpha release over the Easter holiday.
About half the delay is due to problems with the place I decided to host
the app, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. My app seemed to screw up
their import system and for days I could do nothing. It also seems a bit
slow - noticeably slower in production mode than my old laptop in
development mode. When I get to beta testing I’ll probably move to a
different host. I can’t complain too much, as their service is free and
in beta. They are definitely worth checking out for small developments
or hosting.</p>

<p>The other half of the delay is caused by the time taken for my
expectations to return to their original level. Over the last three
months my ideas on what the app should do have expanded greatly, and
that week of delay was me trying to add some last minute features. I
could have kept going forever before releasing anything. Ultimately I
decided it would be best to get something out even if I knew it was a
crappy bare minimum. I hope my alpha tester will persist through some
trying times, but right now I need a little direction. The app is
definitely not as easy to use as it needs to be and I suspect the design
is atrocious. The plan is my alpha tester will help direct me to the
areas that need most attention, and guide me away from those that are
less important.</p>

<p>I have decided that my next milestone will be the end of May for
expanded alpha testing. By then I hope to have something that I can show
to a small, but slightly larger group of people. Anyone interested?</p>

    <p>I was hoping to have a minor status update to announce by now. However,
over the last fortnight there have been a few issues with an external
supplier - I will detail then when they are resolved one way or the
other. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/11/google-launching-todo-list-product/">this caused me to stop breathing

    <p>You know you watched too much of “The Wire” when someone at work says
“there is something wrong with the package” and your first thought is
that the drugs must have been cut with something bad rather than there
was a problem with the weekend’s release.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>So you have decided to add full-text searching to your Ruby on Rails
application. After some investigation (see
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/rubyonrails-deployment@googlegroups.com/msg01882.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2008/03/17/rails-search-benchmarks/">here</a>)
<a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx</a> with the
<a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/ultrasphinx/files/README.html">Ultrasphinx</a>
plugin looks like the best solution for your needs. Just one problem,
despite your deployment environment being Linux, for various reasons
your current development environment is Windows. While Sphinx runs on
Windows, it explicitly states it prefers to run on other systems and
there are a few little gotchas. Here is the step by step guide to
getting it working:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html">Windows
binaries</a> rather than
the source code.</li>
  <li>Extract the contents of the bin/release folder in the zip file you
just downloaded into a location of your choice (eg. C:\Sphinx).</li>
  <li>Add the location of the folder in step 2 into your system path.</li>
  <li>Install chronic - <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem install chronic</code></li>
  <li>Install Ultrasphinx -
<code class="highlighter-rouge">svn export svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/fauna/ultrasphinx/trunk vendor/plugins/ultrasphinx</code></li>
  <li>Copy the example default.base to the app config folder and edit it.
The path variable is the path to the location of the index (created
in step 10), not the Sphinx binaries. Also, find the “set_rotate”
option and set it to 0. This is not supported on Windows at the time
of writing. You probably want to have this set differently in
production.</li>
  <li>Run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake ultrasphinx:configure</code> You should now have a Sphinx conf
file.</li>
  <li>Add indexing to your model.</li>
  <li>Edit the Ultrasphinx.rake (in plugins/ultrasphinx/tasks) and where
you see ‘#{Ultrasphinx::CONF_PATH}’ remove the apostrophes,
otherwise the rake task below won’t be able to find the
configuration file.</li>
  <li>Run rake <code class="highlighter-rouge">ultrasphinx:index</code> You should now have an index in the
location specified in the conf path.</li>
  <li>Run rake <code class="highlighter-rouge">ultrasphinx:daemon:start</code> The sphinx daemon should start
up.</li>
  <li>You are done and should be able to search. Good luck.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In case you are not reading the comments, <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/03/installing-sphinx-ultrasphinx.html#comment-1">Naomi
Novik</a>
has pointed out that Sphinx/Ultrasphinx doesn’t seem to want to work if
the Rails project is in a directory with spaces in the path.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Some people have had problems beyond those I mentioned
above. Take a look at
<a href="https://rubyforge.org/forum/message.php?msg_id=49341">this</a> and
<a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/146630">this</a> if you have extra
problems.</p>

<em>I have removed the commenting system (for privacy concerns), below are the comments that were left on this post before doing so…</em></p>

<p><em>Naomi Novik @ 2008-04-06</em> - Thanks so much for this terrific rundown – saved much much time. I thought I would add on that one other problem in Windows I encountered is that Sphinx/Ultrasphinx doesn’t seem to want to work if the Rails project is in a directory with spaces in the path (eg if you’re working under My Documents or whatnot).</p>
