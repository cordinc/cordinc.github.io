  <div class="content">
    <p>I have recently had occasion to visit a couple Michelin star
restaurants. Together with a previous dinner, I have been to a total of
three restaurants rated one Michelin star (none higher rated). As there
is a bit of buzz at the moment around chefs and restaurants, here are
some brief reviews.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rivercafe.co.uk/">River Cafe</a> - I used to share a flat
around the corner from this place. There were always expensive cars
parked out the front, some with chauffeurs reading a paper in the front
seat. I wanted to see what it was like before leaving London. I had a
crab pasta dish. It was very nice, but I was slightly unimpressed
considering the cost. Nice food, nice wine, it just didn’t grab me.
Although I’d be happy to give it another try sometime.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakkasan">Hakkasan</a> - A subterranean
Chinese restaurant in the west end. The decor was very stylish. The
tables were spotlighted but the paths were in darkness - a cool affect.
The food was very good but my foremost memory of this place is the
service. I found it excessive. The staff were constantly checking on us.
I joked that if I dropped my napkin one of the waiters would catch it
before it hit the floor. Looking around there seemed to be more staff
than diners. Neither I or my partner could relax. I enjoyed the food,
but probably would not go again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thesportsmanseasalter.co.uk/">The Sportsman</a> - This is a
gastro-pub on the coast at Seasalter near Whitstable. It looks like a
standard pub from the outside. Inside it is light (on an overcast day)
and spacious. The staff were friendly, although they did warn me the
stout had a strong taste, maybe they thought I was a tourist. I had a
crab starter with a lamb main and it was cooked perfectly. In short,
unpretentious atmosphere and excellent food. Most surprising of all, the
cost was about the same as an average London restaurant. Definitely
recommended.</p>

    <p>The last month has been quite a busy one; I went on holiday and work is
keeping me busy. However, I need to keep things going and not let large
time gaps discourage me, so here is an update.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alpha testing going slowly. There are a number of regression bugs
from my occasionally drastic functionality changes and these tend to
stop things for a day or so (I find heroku is too slow to edit
online, so I have to fix it at home and upload). At this point the
Test Driven Development people are probably having a laugh at me and
rightly so. In my defence I am still deciding how various features
should work so there is a great deal of change occurring.</li>
  <li>My design skills are as bad as I thought according to the alpha
tester - this will definitely become a problem later.</li>
  <li>I have taken up golf and poker in the last few weeks and I’m
spending time learning. It’s a great deal of fun, as I seem to have
picked up the basics of both fairly quickly. I aim to write more on
these in future.</li>
  <li>I must find more time to work on my project! I’m also setting a goal
of at least one blog post per week.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also learnt a bit about web advertising and SEO through this blog.
Up until the Ultrasphinx post very few people visited this blog. Since
that post I get around 5 people a day, with a couple of spikes to 10 in
one day. Most of these people come from google searches (check it out),
only read the ultrasphinx page, and tend not to stay long. However, a
surprising number of them visit again. I have to admit to a little fear
and trepidation when I first saw the explosion (albeit highly targeted)
in readership. I wasn’t sure what to write. Should I write more
technical articles, as that is what drives people to this blog, or just
continue as before. The lack of technical things to write about made the
decision for me, although I do double-check my spelling now.</p>

<p>In any case the extra readership hasn’t made any difference to my ad
clicks or google page rank. Google still classifies cordinc.com as low
popularity. No one has clicked an ad since the first week of the blog,
earning me a grand total of US14cents. I had originally thought that my
project could be funded by ads, but I’m not so sure now. I don’t think
there is as much money in it as before so I may need to rethink the
business model. Perhaps it’s best just to get the system finished first.</p>

    <p>I reached a milestone in my project progress yesterday. I have just put
a very crude version of my app out for alpha testing. Unfortunately this
is three weeks later than I had originally planned back in January. At
that time I was hoping to do an alpha release over the Easter holiday.
About half the delay is due to problems with the place I decided to host
the app, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>. My app seemed to screw up
their import system and for days I could do nothing. It also seems a bit
slow - noticeably slower in production mode than my old laptop in
development mode. When I get to beta testing I’ll probably move to a
different host. I can’t complain too much, as their service is free and
in beta. They are definitely worth checking out for small developments
or hosting.</p>

<p>The other half of the delay is caused by the time taken for my
expectations to return to their original level. Over the last three
months my ideas on what the app should do have expanded greatly, and
that week of delay was me trying to add some last minute features. I
could have kept going forever before releasing anything. Ultimately I
decided it would be best to get something out even if I knew it was a
crappy bare minimum. I hope my alpha tester will persist through some
trying times, but right now I need a little direction. The app is
definitely not as easy to use as it needs to be and I suspect the design
is atrocious. The plan is my alpha tester will help direct me to the
areas that need most attention, and guide me away from those that are
less important.</p>

<p>I have decided that my next milestone will be the end of May for
expanded alpha testing. By then I hope to have something that I can show
to a small, but slightly larger group of people. Anyone interested?</p>

    <p>I was hoping to have a minor status update to announce by now. However,
over the last fortnight there have been a few issues with an external
supplier - I will detail then when they are resolved one way or the
other. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/04/11/google-launching-todo-list-product/">this caused me to stop breathing
today</a>,
at least until I read

    <p>You know you watched too much of “The Wire” when someone at work says
“there is something wrong with the package” and your first thought is
that the drugs must have been cut with something bad rather than there
was a problem with the weekend’s release.</p>
