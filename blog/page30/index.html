    <p>The series of introductory astronomy courses from
<a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">ANU</a> at <a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a> continues
with <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/violent-universe-anux-anu-astro3x">ANU-ASTRO3x The Violent
Universe</a>,
covering high-energy events and the remnants of stellar explosions. The
structure of the course is exactly the same as <a href="/blog/2014/06/anu-astro1x.html">Part 1 on Great Unsolved
Mysteries</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/09/anu-astro2x.html">Part 2 on
Exoplanets</a>. It is a 9-week course with
about an hour per week of video lectures. There are also mini-tests and
a homework assignment each week with a final exam. The exam is based on
a “mystery” universe nullifying real-world knowledge and forcing the
student to fall back on basic principles. The lectures are almost a
conversational back-and-forth between the presenters <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/pfrancis/">Paul
Francis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schmidt">Brian
Schmidt</a> (with pictures and
notes appearing projected behind them).</p>

<p>The course starts by looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius">Sirius
B</a>. In the 1800’s it was determined
that Sirius (the brightest star in the sky) was wobbling and must be
orbiting another small body with a mass about the same of our Sun. This
led to the discovery of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">white
dwarf</a> stars. These stars are
about as heavy as the Sun, but only as large as the Earth. They also
have a tendency to accrete disks of matter from any larger and less
dense companions. This in turn can result in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_nova">dwarf
novae</a>, where instability in
the accretion disc causes a burst of energy; and, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova">classical
novae</a> when hydrogen from the disc
builds up on the white dwarf, eventually exploding. White dwarves can
also cause the much large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova">type Ia
supernovae</a>, where
enough material accretes on the white dwarf to start carbon fusion and a
runaway thermonuclear explosion. Other types of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">supernovae</a> result from large
stars (much larger than our Sun) reaching the end of their life and
exploding after their core collapses. The remnant of such an event is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron star</a> or maybe even
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black hole</a>.</p>

<p>The difficulty level of these courses only seems to decrease. It is now
so easy I didn’t feel there was any value in spending the time to
complete the assessments - just watching the videos seemed enough. The
lectures still run through the basic maths at the algebraic level (no
calculus), but the assignment is often a multiple choice question or
much simpler maths question.</p>

<p>Entertaining and informative videos, not sure about the value of the
assessment and resulting certification.</p>

    <p>In a burst of enthusiasm for games right before the last Steam Summer
Sale (in June) I played a number of games in my library in an attempt to
increase the played game percentage. Now 15% of my Steam library has
been played (up from 10% beforehand). It would take a lot of time to
clear that backlog! However, in a fit of perversity, most of the games I
played in that burst were games I was unlikely to enjoy - so it didn’t
take too long to decide to abandon them. Anyway, from best to worst,
here are my short reviews from those games.</p>

<p>As before my ranking system falls into 3 broad categories: games I have
finished or want to finish; games I played for a while, but may or may
not play again; and, games I deleted from my spacious hard drive after
an hour or so.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/mark_ninja.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Ninja">Mark of the Ninja</a></em>
is stylish 2D side-scroller action game with a stealth mechanic. You are
a ninja investigating an attack upon your dojo. Thus you creep and swing
your way through various buildings avoiding, or if necessary, quietly
disposing of the guards. Guards can detect you via line of sight (so
disabling lights, or going through the ducting is very handy) or noise.
It is very easy to see what is happening and how your actions affect the
guards. Very impressive UI design. Puzzles seem to be logical and combat
is dangerous and to be avoided. The game is also beautiful, done in a
cartoonish style - mainly in black with occasional flashes of bright
colour. I intend to complete this game.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/Dust.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust:_An_Elysian_Tail">Dust: An Elysian
tale</a></em> is another
pretty hand drawn 2D sidescroller action game, but instead of stealth
the player just fights their way through the huge mass of enemies that
assault them. There is a semblance of story, as the player struggles to
recover their memory as monsters roam the countryside, but it seems
fairly unnecessary. Basically it is fight, fight, fight. And the
fighting is surprisingly fun. The player’s avatar reacts nicely to
commands and feels powerful, with the special actions being particularly
destructive in their devastating effects. My only concern is how quickly
I progressed through the game. While entertaining, none of the battles
were challenging - every fight was won with ease, and I’m not a great
gamer. I stopped about half way through, and am not sure whether I will
return.</p>

    <p>Have you heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs?">sunken cost
fallacy</a> It is where people
base their decisions on historical costs rather than future benefits. It
is logically incorrect as events or costs incurred previously are in the
past and should not affect people’s next decisions. However, it is very
common.</p>

<p>Right now, I may be falling foul of this fallacy, but I don’t care! I
must finish Concealed Intent!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/work/ConcealedIntent_WIP2_20141117.png"><img src="/assets/posts/work/ConcealedIntent_WIP2_20141117_thumb.png" alt="Concealed Intent WIP" /></a></p>

<p>Work on the game is continuing. It has been just over <a href="/blog/2012/07/concealed-intent.html">2 years of my
life</a> now, and I think it is
finally nearing completion. To that end, I have set a deadline of the
beginning of March next year. That is not a random date, it is when the
<a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer’s Conference</a> is held, which I
will attend. I still think that is an achievable date. Although when I
look at the the screenshot from last week (above) I still see so many
things that have yet to be done. It appears to be an ever expanding list
of todo items, as finishing one task presents many previously
unconsidered tasks! I have heard it said that no game is finished - they
are all just abandoned when “good enough”!</p>

<p>Soon I will be ready for another round of testing. So if you have
previously said you are interested, I hope to contact you, probably in
the new year for some early beta testing (I’ll put you on the <a href="http://eepurl.com/7uj2j">Concealed
Intent mailing list</a>).</p>

<p>As obscurity seems to be the greatest enemy of the indie game developer,
I have also begun to get the good word out on Concealed Intent. There is
a <a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/author/CharlesCordingley/992571/">blog at
Gamasutra</a>
and soon other places too. Plus many social media accounts as detailed
below. If you have any other ideas where I should promote the game,
please let me know!</p>

    <p>Reading stories about the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/oct/31/paying-the-price-of-war-britain-makes-good-on-historic-debts">British government beginning to pay down some
of its World War I
debts</a>
reminded me of my old job. I know a few people who are probably quite
happy this is finally happening. This is not because they believe the UK
has too much debt and needs to pay it off, but because it will make
their jobs just a little easier, as it would have for me five years ago.</p>

<p>The background is that the UK raised a very large amount of debt to pay
for fighting WWI. Soon after the war was finished the debt was
refinanced into “consols” (along with some older bonds). These consols
are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_bond">perpetual bonds</a> (we
used to call them “perps”) - a very rare form of debt where the original
debt need never be paid back (it is the government’s choice). Instead
they just pay interest for ever (“in perpetuality”), unlike normal
government bonds which mature and the principal repaid after some set
period of time (commonly 5, 10, or 20 years). Thanks to inflation and a
low rate of interest, it has never been in the financial interest of the
UK government to cancel their consols (and thus repay the principal) -
it is very cheap debt. Presumably right now is the unusual occasion when
interest rates are so low that paying off the consols makes sense (at
least I hope so). Of course it is also good publicity for a government
strongly associated with austerity to pay off such symbolic long-term
debts.</p>

<p>These consols and other perps comprise a vanishingly small fraction of
UK debt and an even smaller proportion of traded debt (as the debt
holders don’t tend to sell them very often). Someone working in UK and
European bonds could pretend they don’t exist, and 99% of the time this
would not be a problem. Then there is the other 1% of the time.
Perpetual bonds have a different set of calculations for working out
their price and other maturity dependent values. When writing code for
pricing and trading bonds, testing should include perps to check they
are correctly handled. In the fast paced world of front-office IT, this
extra checking is sometimes forgotten. Normally nothing untoward
happened as a result. However, errors did occur, normally days after the
code was released (as it takes that long for a perp transaction to
occur). I was lucky enough never to have that particular problem while
working in a bank, although I did something similar once with uncommon
<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield_basis.asp">yield-quoted
bonds</a> and felt
like an idiot for forgetting such instruments existed (but it never
happened again - I always tested with them after that).</p>

<p>So congratulations to the technical people writing fixed income pricing
and trading systems. With the consols gone there is failure point
removed. Hopefully soon your code will be simpler and all the <code>if
(isPerp) { … </code> blocks can be deleted.</p>

    <p>Playing <a href="/blog/2014/08/eve-online.html">Eve</a> has really made me think
about the financials of online gaming with regards to digital goods.
Like most online games, Eve bans real money trading (RMT). That is, buy
or selling of in-game items for real-world money is forbidden. The
exception being that it is ok to buy PLEX (game time vouchers that can
be used in-game) from Eve or approved affiliates. A non-approved
reseller, Somer, was <a href="http://themittani.com/news/somer-blink-shutting-down">recently
shutdown</a>.</p>

<p>This intrigues me. It seems to me that real-world trading would make
players more engaged in a game. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">Second
Life</a> made a virtue of RMT and
didn’t seem to suffer ill affects from the policy (their problems seem
to originate in being over-hyped). So why do nearly all MMOs ban the
practice? Is it because the companies want to control the market for
selling these goods themselves? Maybe partially, but having a resale
value only increases the possible primary sale price and increases
demand. I’m not sure this is the main reason. Perhaps there are legal
issues? I’m no lawyer, so this is possible. An online investigation
discovered another possible reason -
<a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.hu/2013/02/avoiding-rmt-issue.html">avoiding</a>
<a href="http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/2013/02/whats-wrong-with-rmt.html">professionals</a>.</p>

<p>If it is possible to earn money from playing the game (through RMT),
then some people may find that that playing intensively results in
enough money to live (or thrive). This is definitely possible, even
although the activity is banned, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">gold
farming</a> in many games is
profitable enough to make a living. The now closed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_III">Diablo
3</a> auction house suffered a
similar problem. Some players acquired huge amount of loot and then sold
it so cheaply that other players without the same interest in grinding
would just buy it from them.</p>

<p>The problem seems to originate in the standard mechanics of such games.
In-game rewards come from endlessly repeatable activities - usually as
loot. Why get rewards for killing creatures? Why do those creatures
respawn over and over again? Why do the creatures have all this great
stuff on them (instead of leaving it at home) and why don’t they use it?
In some games, why can players carry so much? It is because these
loot-based rewards promote people playing - perform an action, get a
reward. Companies that produce these games want to discourage
professionalism so other players have a chance to partake in this
gamification. Introducing scarcity by limiting the spawning of enemies
would make the situation worse as this would make the resulting rewards
even more valuable.</p>

<p>To have RMT and reduce professionalism, these games would need to stop
repetition of gameplay as the basis for rewards - like Minecraft. Or,
stop repetition of the core gameplay, by perhaps time-limiting players
(but then a pro might have many characters or a whole team). Or, co-opt
the professionals’ activities into creating content for other players.
This last options seems the best, but is it possible or even desirable?
Eve manages it a little with its null sec sovereignity and corporations,
but at the expense of large-scale player-vs-player gameplay (which
brings its own problems). I suspect the far easier option is to just ban
RMT.</p>
