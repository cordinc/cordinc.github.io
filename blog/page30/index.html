  <div class="content">
    <p>When I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth">Perth</a> the
supermarkets always had good and relatively cheap food available.
However, I remember the local restaurants seemed to lack effort as far
as the menu was concerned (good service was never an issue). It was as
though they just relied on the high quality ingredients to carry them.
Coming back to town after 13 years abroad, I think that situation has
changed. We ate excellent meals everywhere we went, and the range of
styles available was impressive. Perth is becoming a world city, at
least as far as cuisine is concerned. It was also nice that all but two
of the restaurants we visited (over a fortnight) had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_fresco_dining">Al
fresco</a> sections -
unfortunately the weather was a bit damp for us to take proper advantage
of them. I also noted with interest that most restaurants listed the
providence of their ingredients and that the vast majority of these
originated inside West Australia itself - overseas elements were notable
in their rarity.</p>

<p>While in Perth, two restaurants in stood out as being of a particularly
high quality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lot20.co">Lot 20</a> is almost hidden in a building on the edge
of the cultural district near James St in Northbridge. The decor is
modern gastropub. The service was very friendly without being too much.
When asking about <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/12471/soninlaw-eggs">son-in-law
eggs</a>, the reply
not only included the recipe, but also their cultural significance (a
Thai dish made as warning to behave to a new son-in-law). After ordering
the eggs, asparagus, cauliflower and a chicken dish, we got to watch
them being prepared in the open kitchen which our table overlooked. All
the food was excellent and perfectly cooked. The chicken deserves
special mention. At first I thought it had been undercooked, but an
exploratory taste showed I was completely wrong. It had been cooked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide">in
a water bath</a> to keep it moist
and tender - incredible. We also drank some excellent local beers. I
used to say that beer, chocolate and TV were all clearly better in
London. Now I will have say that the beer (and perhaps chocolate) are
about the same - TV in Britain is still better though.</p>

<p>When I lived in Perth, Steve’s on the river in Nedlands was a large
student pub (<a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au">UWA</a> is nearby). Since then the pub
has been demolished and turned into fancy apartments. However, there is
still a restaurant and wine shop at the site, still called
<a href="http://www.steves.com.au">Steve’s</a>. Wine is a large focus of the
restaurant and there is a dedicated sommelier as well as a large
selection of local wines. The cuisine is vaguely French inspired. For an
entree I had a chorizo soup - a spicy meaty mix, well balanced and not
oily. Then the pork cassoulet with a side salad for mains. Beautifully
cooked, it quickly filled my stomach, but I kept eating until finished -
it was too good to leave anything behind. The wine was also very good,
but I don’t remember what we ordered.</p>

    <p>After 11 years away I finally returned to my
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth">hometown</a>, but only for one very
busy week, followed by a slower week down south near <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_River,_Western_Australia">Margret
River</a>.
It was a strange fortnight being reminded what the place is like, and I
was sorry to be leaving again so quickly. It was surprising how liveable
the city appears and how relaxed the people seem to be. It was also nice
to be in place again with so much space and clean air! Of course all
that comes at the expense of it being a quiet city compared to the
bustling hyperactive metropolis of London (and to a lesser extent KL).</p>

<p>The best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/wa_14.html">available

    <p>Current episodes available via paid subscription at
<a href="http://velocast.cc/subscribe">Velocast</a>, much older episodes available
at <a href="http://velocastcc.squarespace.com/twich">this website</a>.</p>

<p>For a change from ancient history, I have started listening to a podcast
on cycling history. Produced by the people at
<a href="http://velocast.cc">Velocast.cc</a>, it is also notable as the first
podcast or MOOC I have reviewed that actually costs money. For £8/month
a subscriber gains access to weekly news and history podcasts and daily
new podcasts during major races (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_de_France">Tour de
France</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giro_d%27Italia">Giro
d’Italia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuelta_a_Espana">Vuelta a
Espana</a> and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_cycle_races">Classics</a>). I
received a years subscription as a gift and consider it good value (so
will probably resubscribe at the end of the year). All the podcasts are
very entertaining, including TWiCH (as they refer to it). Production
quality is high.</p>

<p>Each episode is roughly 45 minutes to an hour long and endeavours to
reference events that happened during the same week in previous years.
So in May most episodes refer to events that occurred during the Giro,
during March it is the classics, and so on. This plan breaks down a bit
with races that move around the calendar (like the Vuelta) and during
the winter off-season. The episodes contain 3 segments. Each segment
starts with a few minutes of pre-recorded introductory context on a
particular event or aspect of bicycle racing. Then there is 10-20
minutes of lively discussion between the two presenters. Often they
deviate wildly from the topic at hand, but it is always entertaining
(and usually informative). Recent stories include: the hotly-contested
Tour de France <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanterne_rouge">Lanterne
Rouge</a> (last place)
“competition” in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Schonbacher">1979</a>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Roche">Stephen
Roche</a> winning the Giro in
1987 against his own teammate; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Anquetil">Jacques
Anquetil</a> winning his
only monument,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liege-Bastogne-Liege">Liege-Bastogne-Liege</a>
in 1966. In general the stories are interesting and not the traditional
famous ones heard repeatedly. The subsequent discussions are lively and
entertaining. The two presenters have an immense knowledge of cycling
history between them. Although they do often seem to mention cycling
clothing fashion, pedalling style and Irish cyclists (one of the
presenters is always <a href="https://twitter.com/irishpeloton">Cillian Kelly</a>
who is Irish, so familiarity is probably the reason).</p>

<p>For fans of cycling who want to know more about the colourful history of
the sport.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a> is a game I have consciously
avoided over the years. Not because I thought I wouldn’t enjoy it, but
because I might enjoy it too much, and thus see too much otherwise
productive time slip away (<a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> is
another game I avoid for similar reasons). However, recently the game
had a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> sale so I thought
I’d give it a try. After all, I’m writing a vaguely similar game (albeit
single-player) and have pretensions towards writing more games along a
similar theme. It would be remiss not to experience, and try to learn
from, one of the giants of the genre - a very successful game over a
sustained period of time. Or at least that was my justification.</p>

    <p>Young kids today - embarrassing themselves all over the Internet with
their ill-advised photos! They will never be able to obtain high public
office! Of course, I think the only difference between the current and
previous generations is in the wide availability of evidence of their
indiscretions after the fact. There exists (or at least used to exist 20
years ago) a photo of me, which I think is understandable, but with a
bit of spin in the media would stop me becoming Prime Minister. Let me
explain.</p>

<p>During my 4th year at university I lived in a student house (I was 20).
There were four of us in a large house on Vincent Street opposite Hyde
Park in Mount Lawley. Besides me, there was a just-graduated accountant,
a med student who seemed to spend most of his time partying, an artist
and normally a random person or two crashing on our sofa. The artist was
an interesting guy - a Thai orphan raised in Australia. Much of his art
focused on satirising the military. We had a series of paintings around
the house of Godzilla sized cartoonish characters in military uniforms
(usually from World War 2) rampaging through cities or battlefields.
Right outside my bedroom door was a giant Goofy-like character throwing
tanks around. He also had an original 9 foot Nazi Swastika flag in his
bedroom (the house had very high ceilings).</p>

<p>I have met a few overt racists in my time, and this artist was
definitely not one of them. If he was harbouring any fascist tendencies
they were very well hidden. He claimed to be interested in the art of
Nazi Germany and so collected artefacts from that time. Kind of like
admiring the films of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl">Leni
Riefenstahl</a> while
ignoring their propagandistic purpose. He had a few other items as well,
but tended to buy them, hold onto them for a few months (taking photos
and drawing them) and then sell them to fund new items. While we were in
the same house he sold a SS dagger to buy an original
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> uniform jacket. This
is where I join the story.</p>

<p>He normally took photos with a blue-eyed blond-haired friend modelling
the items he bought. The artist never appeared in the photos himself as
he said he didn’t fit, being a dark-skinned South-east Asian. However,
the Luftwaffe jacket would not fit his friend - it was very small. At
the time I did a lot of long distance cycling and was quite small
myself. At just over 5’9” and just under 59kg, I was borderline
underweight according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">Body mass
Index</a>. Also I have
blue-eyes and, at the time, had sun-blonde hair. So the artist asked me
to put it on and I thought “why not?”</p>

<p>That jacket was small. The length was about right for me, maybe it was
for someone an inch or two shorter. Still, I could barely do up one
button. I was forbidden from trying a second in case I ripped it. It was
uncomfortably tight across the shoulders and chest. Whoever wore this
originally was very small - either they were a young teenager or
undernourished (or both!). The artist said it dated from 1944, towards
the end of the war. I guess by that stage Germany was desperate for
manpower and pressed anyone they could into service. It was also made of
poor material. It felt like a Hessian sack, very rough to touch. Again,
this is apparently not unusual for uniforms from that time (as times
were tough). Lastly, the jacked had a small rip just below my last left
rib. Was it a bullet hole, or just an accident from sometime during the
50 years since its manufacture? We didn’t know and there was no mention
of it in the accompanying documentation.</p>

<p>Then two photos were taken and my career in public office finished
before it began. Or probably not. Those photos are 20 years old now. I
look quite different (no hair and much heavier for a start!). I never
saw the result. I don’t even know if they were actually developed (this
being before digital cameras) or if they still exist. However, I learnt
more about the conditions at the end of the war in those few minutes
wearing that jacket than in my high school education (or various
jingoistic war movies). I feel great pity for the poor boy who wore that
same jacket half a century before me. I can’t say I regret it.</p>
