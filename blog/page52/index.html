</ul>

<p>So after nearly 7 years on EGB technology teams I have moved on. Not out
of banking (at least not yet), but when the opportunity came to try a
different business area I jumped. This is despite being able to earn
more money if I stayed in my EGB niche. There are two related reasons
for leaving: the industry and technology are both changing to the
detriment of developers.</p>

<p>When I started in 2005, EGB trading was already on an upswing that
lasted through 2009. I’m not sure when this upwards trajectory began,
but the people around me considered it normal. Business was good
throughout the mortgage and banking crisis of 2008. When times are good
and the desks are making good money some of it is reinvested into
technology. There was a lot of optimism and this translated into banks
wanting the fastest and smartest trading platform. We got to rewrite
systems. Increasingly business was relying on technology - it was
becoming trade-by-wire. It seemed that there was much further to go.
Algorithmic trading is big in equities, why couldn’t it be big in fixed
income too. There was huge potential for writing interesting code.</p>

<p>This environment no longer exists. It was only when the European debt
crisis began to bite in 2011 that things trended downwards, but then
they went down fast. There is a great deal less ambition among the fixed
income desks. Most traders seem happy just to not be losing money -
something many are not achieving. Some banks are shutting down their
bonds desks. As a natural consequence there is less to spend on
technology and little desire to do more than maintenance. Flow volume is
king, and as far as technology development is concerned, that is not
hard. Thus less developers are required and the work is less
interesting.</p>

<p>Combined with this is the creeping commoditisation of bonds technology.
When I started ION provided mainly gateways, little tools and their
message bus. Over time they have climbed up the product stack. Now they
also sell pricing engines, autoquoters, autohedgers, risk engines,
position servers - nearly everything a bank needs to trade cash bonds.
The quality is fine too. Their applications won’t do everything a desk
requires, but it will do most of it and the desk’s technology team can
add the remainder quickly. Not all banks will use vendor systems (many
don’t like Ion or see advantage in bespoke systems), but enough will to
affect the market for EGB technologists.</p>

<p>Thus, once again, less developers are required and the work is less
interesting. I don’t see the situation changing until the market
improves - and I don’t see that happening soon. So I thought it time to
try a different business area.</p>

  Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Goals.html">Goals</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Just 12 months ago I said I hoped to achieve the below by the start of
this year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Result:
achieved.</strong> - 48 posts in 12 months, so this target was easily
surpassed.</li>
  <li><strong>Only have 2 programming projects going at the same time. Result:
achieved.</strong> - I did this to the letter of the goal, but there were a
couple of abandoned projects along the way. On the plus side, I did
a couple of successful little projects to teach myself game coding
(see <a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/">my blender page</a>) and now I’m
working on a larger game demo to test out some ideas.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete 2 Blender models. Result: partial.</strong> - I did two, a
<a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/lamp">Roman lamp</a> and a
<a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/spaceship/index.html">spaceship</a>.
However, I originally planned to do two completely different (more
complex) models. This difference occurred as I needed to learn the
new Blender 2.5 interface, and then wanted to focus on game models
rather than historical models.</li>
  <li><strong>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: maybe.</strong> - I
bought a new computer and it is quite large. Apart from that I have
less, but when included it is about even.</li>
  <li><strong>Run 5km in 27 minutes. Result: not even close.</strong> - My foot problem
has not abated all year. A few abortive runs midyear quickly led to
a reoccurrence of the injury and further rest. Only now do I seem to
be back to normal - but I’m yet to properly test it.</li>
  <li><strong>Work less, travel more. Result: achieved.</strong> -
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/11/north-cornwall.html">Cornwall</a>,
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/10/turkey.html">Turkey</a>,
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/04/andalusia.html">Andalusia</a>,
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/02/tenerife.html">Tenerife</a>, plus
some other little holidays.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain general Ruby and Scala skills. Result: partial.</strong> - I’ve
done some Ruby, but no Scala.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the coming year I have decreased the number of goals, mainly because
there are a few big ones:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Never more than
4 a month. Historically this shouldn’t be a problem, but I also
don’t want it to become a time sink.</li>
  <li>Complete the game demo and send it out for comments. If the feedback
is not disastrous start working on a full game. This is my main goal
now. I’d also like to do one other project over the year (probably a
simple website).</li>
  <li>Be able to run. I just want my foot to be completely better so and I
can run without concern, speed is not important.</li>
  <li>Decrease net ownership of physical goods, as always but especially
relevant considering the next goal.</li>
  <li>Leave the UK. Recent events mean this will probably be my last year
in the UK. It took months to organise my move here. I expect a
similar effort this time.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus as a nice to do, if I have time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain general Blender, Ruby and Scala skills - same as last year.</li>
</ul>

<p>Modern investment trading relies very heavily on technology. Computers
are now involved in nearly every corner of large banks’ trading
activities - a big change from more manual processes over 20 years ago.
It would certainly be impossible to run a EGB primary dealership without
significant technology expenditure. This post details an overview of the
technologies I saw on EGB desks.</p>

<p>Over my time working for EGB desks I was always a Software Developer,
and software is the part of the industry I know best. Code written in
banks is not especially different to other places, although there is a
difference in attitude. This starts before a person even joins a bank.</p>
