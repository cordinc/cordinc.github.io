    <p>On February 5th 2008, the first post on this blog was published. This is
the 201st posting, so it is time for a recap. The blog was originally to
document the creation of a business website. That business idea,
Queuesaurus, has been and gone, but the blog continues. I think it is
useful to practice writing - it’s certainly not for the money!</p>

<p>In nearly four and a half years this blog has generated 133,340 page
views from 70,904 unique visitors. This has resulted in 77 AdSense
clicks for income of $31 (versus a hosting cost over the same period of
$104). However, it is gratifying to see that the number of visitors is
on a steadily upward trend. As the graph below shows, the number of
monthly visits has grown to around 4500/month at present.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/meta/visitors.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most people visiting this blog will never read this post. 75% of people
come to it through a search engine (mainly Google) and view a single
technical article. The top ten posts account for 60% of the page views
and all of those ten are technical in nature (<a href="http://cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-with-vali.html">this is the most popular
page</a>,
and <a href="http://cordinc.com/blog/2008/03/installing-sphinx-ultrasphinx.html">this the second most
popular</a>).</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are only 14 comments on the site. I had to turn
comments off a couple of years ago because I was receiving about 50 spam
comments a day after the spam filters cleared out the most obvious ones!</p>

    <p>In July last year I opened a <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding
Circle</a> account. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-to-person_lending">P2P
lending</a> site
where people can lend money to British businesses. The idea is that a
business asks for a loan along with company details and usually a
director guarantee (so the director is personally responsible if the
company defaults). The site’s members then participate in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_auction">reverse
auction</a> to fund part of
the loan in amounts down to £20. Funding Circle advertise that their
members receive a 8.5% gross return on average. Below are notes on my
experience of the site.</p>

    <p>Available from
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/maya-weekend/id443941013">iTunes</a>
with the video podcasts also on
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/pennmuseum/videos?query=maya">YouTube</a></p>

<p>In 2011 <a href="http://www.penn.museum/">Penn Museum</a> hosted a weekend academic
conference on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization">Maya
civilization</a>. This
series consists of recordings from that conference; each podcast is a
single presentation. The topics covered focus on Mayan women and
archaeological techniques (lots of discussion of research from doctoral
dissertations). There are eleven episodes all around 30-40 minutes in
length. Five are videos of presentations (so that the presenter and
their slides are visible), but the remainder are audio-only recordings.
Production quality is generally good, although the videos do
occasionally go out of focus. The talks are quite academic and dry. I
found it hard to follow sometimes, perhaps because I don’t have enough
background in Mayan history to hang the new facts upon. This series is
probably best for people who already have a knowledge of Mayan history.</p>

<p>The five video presentations all look at aspects of modern archaeology
technique. One looks at remote sensing - the process of using photos or
data from planes and satellites to identity large ancient sites (usually
because the vegetation growing over ruins is somehow different to
normal). Another presentation takes the complete opposite approach and
details pedestrian surveys. This is as it sounds - walking around and
recording what is seen, not as easy as it sounds in a jungle. This talk
provided some interesting details on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunchucmil">Chunchucmil</a>, a town much
larger than local agriculture could support so trading must have
occurred. One presentation looks at what can be discovered from skeletal
remains. This is not just looking at the wear and tear on the body, but
also analysing isotopes in the bones. In this manner the researcher
discovered about a quarter of people at one site emigrated from their
childhood areas. Another researcher analysed pollen samples found in
lake sediment to determine historical ecology. They found that the
highest levels of deforestation occurred soon after agriculture began.
It seems these first farmers didn’t know the limits of the land. At the
time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Maya_collapse">Mayan
collapse</a> forest
levels were fairly balanced, opposing some theories suggesting that
deforestation was the cause. Instead, evidence was found for drought
around this time, boosting an opposing theory. The last video
presentation promotes a new <a href="http://mayaarch3d.unm.edu/">repository of 3D measurements and models of
Mayan sites</a>.</p>

<p>Without the aid of visuals many of the audio-only podcasts are very dry
and hard to follow. Some becoming just recitations of events in Mayan
history. All but one of the audio presentation look at the position of
women in Mayan culture (the other concerned with inter-city interaction
and trade). Some notable facts include that at least three women rose to
become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajaw">Ajaws</a> (rulers of their city)
and that childbirth was considered equivalent of going to war.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A cool little feature of Unity3D scripting I recently found is using
conditional compilation for debug statements. The C based languages (but
not Java unfortuately) have inbuilt preprocessors that allow developers
to only compile certain parts of the code if certain parameters are set
(it can also do much more, including macros). Thus you could write the
below and the code would only be included in the executable if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEBUG</code>
is defined.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="err">#</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">DEBUG</span>
    <span class="c1">// do some special code</span>
<span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">endif</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Unity3D has a similar system. Mostly the docs (<a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/Platform%20Dependent%20Compilation.html">available
here</a>)
seem to suggest this is for specialist code for different platforms:
iPhone, Web, PC, etc. Thus the defined parameters are set in advance
(e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNITY_IPHONE</code>). However, there is one that is useful for
debugging, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNITY_EDITOR</code>. This will only be set if the application is
running inside the Unity3D GUI. Once you build the app those lines of
code will be skipped. It can be used like the below example - very
handy.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="err">#</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="nx">UNITY_EDITOR</span>
    <span class="nx">Debug</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nc">Log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Debugging</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">endif</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>According to <a href="http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/71445-How-To-Set-Project-Wide-pragma-Directives-with-JavaScript">this Unity3D forum
post</a>
it is also possible to define your own project specific preprocessor
parameters.</p>
