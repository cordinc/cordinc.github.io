<p>Five hardy souls braved the hail to attend the 4th Poker evening held
last Saturday in the salubrious surroundings of a Fitzrovia public
house. Ann, Pete, Christian, Amanda and I met for the now standard 2
Hold’em tournaments. Congratulations Amanda for being the big winner on
the day, with Christian just edging out myself in the winnings list.</p>

<p>The first game started slow with few big hands, small bets and a great
deal of bluffing (at least from myself). At one point my bad dealing
allowed some people to see that one of Pete’s pre-flop cards was a jack.
He decided to keep it and displayed it for all to see. When the flop was
jack-high, everyone folded except Ann. When another jack came on the
turn, the bets got bigger and the quips began “Ann, do you think he’s
bluffing”? In the end Ann’s J10 was better than Pete’s J6. As soon as
the half hour mark was reached and the blinds increased the game became
much looser. Amanda was out first, then Ann tried to catch my bluff with
KQs against my heavy betting, but I wasn’t bluffing with QQ. Soon Pete
was out and it was Christian and I, man-to-man. However, Christian’s
luck ran out shoving against my A10 with his pocket pair. It was all
over in under an hour.</p>

<p>The second match began with a furious pace. Early on Pete and I were
quite aggressive and on a couple of occasions got caught in bluffs (I
did and it looked like Pete did too). Myself, Amanda and Pete went out
in the first 30 minutes and rebought. I was out again soon after, going
all-in on the flop with a mid-pair and flush draw. Ann was again sure I
was bluffing, and considering my roughly 35% change of getting the flush
she wasn’t too far off. Later Pete pushed preflop and most of the table
folded. As two 4’s came on the flush Ann was visibly disappointed - she
had folded the other two 4’s. The commiserations didn’t last long as in
the next hand Pete’s AKs was beaten by Amanda who had four 5’s! With
Pete and myself out it looked like the game may settle down as the next
few hands were quite passively played. However, Amanda soon took up the
mantle of aggression with relish, building a stack that would win any
game of <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/">desktop defense</a>. With
consistent betting she gave no clues to her hands. At one point Amanda
with 27o (the worst possible hand) matched big pre-flop bets against Ann
with JJ. When the flop and turn came with two 7’s and not much else,
Amanda bet big and Ann again tried to catch a bluff. Thus, a very small
stack Christian played Amanda heads-up. Amanda continued to push every
hand (“poker is easy when you have such a big stack”) and Christian was
soon left as the big blind with only a small blind stack. With Christian
all-in just to make the blinds, the hole cards were dealt face-up - his
AA won the smallest possible pot! Christian’s luck came too late and the
game was over on the next hand - Amanda was the winner.</p>
