<h4>SOAP and REST</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>For a recent project I had to connect to two different read-only web
services. Both were from commercial vendors providing very similar
information (which I aggregated). One API was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>
based the other used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>. The REST
interface took me a few hours to write, the SOAP one took days!</p>

<p>For the REST interface I had to send requests to a URL that somewhat
indicated what I was attempting to do - eg
http://example.site/contracts/123 to get the details of contract with id 123. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> was returned and using a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML">SAX</a> parser
constructed my internal objects. In total it took 340 lines of my code
to handle the entire web service. Easy!</p>

<p>Using the SOAP interface required me to download their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language">WSDL</a>
and then construct a model of their domain objects - I used <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/">Apache
Axis2</a> (not Apache Axis though, that is an
old and unmaintained project that does the same thing - a confusion that
cost me some time). Unfortunately the WSDL was wrong and the model
didn’t generate properly. I had to dive into the 2000 line WSDL file to
find and fix the error - and it was near unreadable! Try looking at a
commercial WSDL file some time. After some trial and error the model was
right and when surrounded by copious error handling code it could be
sent and data received from the service. It took 810 lines of my code,
plus hundreds more in the generated model. Urgh. At this point one might
suggest it was just a problem caused by a dodgy service provider.
However, I have since added a third read-only web service to the
project. It is also SOAP based and just as difficult to get running
properly - apart from having to modify the WSDL since theirs was correct
from the start.</p>

<p>I also have experience from the other side, providing a web service.
Using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> I added a REST interface
to my existing website by just providing XML views of the data. While
working at a bank a SOAP interface to an existing legacy system was
required, it took a great deal of fiddling and trust in our IBM
development tools to get it working after a couple of days.</p>

<p>The experience reminds me of an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/29/oreilly_amazon/">interview on The
Register</a> where
Tim O’Reilly suggests that SOAP is a standards first specification
created without reference to how it would be used in the real world
(because at the time the spec was created there weren’t any people using
it). SOAP definitely feels like an overengineered solution. The kind of
thing I would have loved earlier in my career when suffering from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System
Syndrome</a>. Over time
I am becoming increasingly appreciative of simplicity in code.</p>

<p>For me, there is now no comparison. SOAP just doesn’t seem to work well
in any place I’ve seen it tried. My first choice for web service API
will have to be REST.</p>
