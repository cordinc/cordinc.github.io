<p><strong>Deux because they’re fancy!</strong></p>

<p>Starting with the best, <a href="http://www.pied-a-terre.co.uk/">Pied a Terre</a>
is a small, intimate restaurant in Fitzrovia. At least I think it is
small. It appears to be a converted house, so there are many small
rooms. We were in the front room with four tables, most of which were
empty during our meal, and none were in our eyeline. The large front
window was frosted to just above head height. The room felt light, but
no one on the street could see in, nor could we be distracted. Combined
with the staff materialising as if from nowhere whenever required, the
impression was a private dining experience. It is the effect
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/05/fancy-restaurants.html">Hakkasan</a>
was attempting and failing to achieve (there I felt as if I was on a
stage with down lighting trying to isolate our table in a large room).
We ordered the tasting menu with the discovery wines option. Were I to
describe each dish it would become a bore of hyperbole. It is safe to
say the food was incredible, sometime surprisingly so. I’m not normally
a fan of raw tuna, but here the flavour was exquisite. The wine was of a
high standard with two outstanding exceptions and another disappointing
exception (which turned out to be from my home town). Although with 8
glasses over 10 courses it was too much and we had to leave nearly half.
The staff were friendly but to the point and never instrusive. Overall,
the meal was verging on perfection. The main negative point was the
expense - oh my lord the expense. It is by far the most expensive meal
I’ve ever had by a long way. About 50% more expensive than Hakkasan,
which I thought was expensive. For the cost of this meal for two, you
could feed eleven at The Sportsman. Having said that, I’m glad to have
been once, just not sure I could justify another visit before I win the
Lotto jackpot. If this is what two Michelin stars is like, how much
better can three be?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.babur.info/website/index.php">Babur</a> is an Indian
restuaurant in Forest Hill (about 15 minutes walk from where I live)
which recently won an award. I thought it was the “Best Cheap Eat in
South London”, but I’m told that’s not right, and if it is correct then
it must only just qualify on the price criteria (to my mind it’s at the
high end of cheap - £60 for two, with beer but no wine or dessert).
Their takeaway menu is very good so we went for a sitdown meal. The food
was excellent. I had the ostrich starter with tandoori jumbo prawns (the
largest prawns I have seen in Britain), it was mouthwatering and
satisfying in the way good curry can be. Based on the food alone, this
would be one of my favourites. However, I found the service a little
lacking. Our naan was forgotten, but when pointed out it was removed
from the bill with no hassle. Also they tried to sell us a loyalty card
a little too strongly. At first I was interested, but after a quick
calculation realised it wouldn’t be much use to us. We politely refused.
So far no problem. However, they then proceeded to try selling it to us
a further two times, each time explaining to us the “benefits” in full
as if we hadn’t grasped the system the first time. I wasn’t impressed.
Overall, despite the hassle it’s worth a visit.</p>
