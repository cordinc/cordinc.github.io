<h4>Context in Software Development Advice</h4>

<p>Previously I wrote about big companies not using Ruby, Scala or similar
new languages because they are not mature enough, adding that this
probably wouldn’t apply in small companies. This implies an underlying
assumption - that big and small companies are different. This might be
obvious to most readers, but based on my experience it isn’t to many
people I see working in software. Much of the software development
advice around is only useful for one type of organisation, although
people get hung up on trying to apply it to everyone.</p>

<p>To me, as far as a software team is concerned, a big company is one
where there is a sizeable layer of bureaucracy. This can manifest as a
large number of political players, passive stakeholders who can greatly
change requirements, seemingly arbitrary requirements, or just filling
in forms and otherwise jumping through hoops. This is not to say that
all of this is unnecessary - some degree of bureaucracy is required to
stop developers going off on complete flights of fancy. Also government
regulation often requires development to follow a set path; a developer
doing their own thing could unknowingly expose the company to sanctions
or lawsuits. There seems to be a correlation between the traditional
measures of a big firm and bureaucracy (employees and revenues), but
they don’t always align. I have worked for a very profitable 50K+
employee firm and been allowed to do largely as I wished. While at a 50
person startup in a highly regulated (and litigious!) domain, I was
drowned in paperwork.</p>

<p>Each system has its own advantages &amp; disadvantages. Personally I prefer
working in smaller companies, or at least in parts of large companies
that have more of a small company feel. However, far more developers
work under big firm conditions, and I have met good developers who
prefer the system. So when I read about <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/04/22/killing-innovation-with-corner-cases/">avoiding corner
cases</a>
I think “yeah, lets get things done”, but at the same time realise this
might not work in an IT department of a large commercial bank. I can
also empathise with <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2009-04/episode-132-top-10-architecture-mistakes-eoin-woods">Eoin
Woods</a>
about how a Software Architect needs to be able to find and involve all
the stakeholders of a project, especially the hidden, passive ones that
can stop a project right before it goes into production - a lesson I
learnt the hard way. Although, most small firms wouldn’t even need a
Software Architect. Obviously the context of the advice is crucial.</p>

<p>Some of the best advice I ever received in software development was
while working at a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process">Rational Unified
Process</a>
consultancy in the late 90’s. The RUP is a large and detailed beast
often favoured by large companies, although the consultancy successfully
applied it to many clients large and small. This was done by never
straying from the spirit of the process, but very regularly deviating
from the written word of the process. I remember one of the owners there
telling me the first step of the RUP on a project was to work out which
bits of it you should throw out as unnecessary (the implication being
that most of it would be bypassed).</p>

<p>Basically, there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">no silver
bullet</a>. Advice is just
that, advice. Think about how the advice fits your situation - what are
the premises, and don’t just blindly follow it. I think software
projects work best where they are done by people who look to understand
their environment and can adapt - not just retrying the same old thing
that worked last time (for you or someone else).</p>
