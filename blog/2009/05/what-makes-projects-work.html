<h4>What Makes Projects Work</h4>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Software Project Management.html">Software Project Management</a>
    
<br/><br/>
<p>Recently I got in a drunken conversation with another long time
developer and consultant about what makes software projects succeed. We
both had many years of experience with many different projects, so it
was particularly gratifying that we largely agreed with each other (or
was that the alcohol?). Having seen many people write their
prescriptions to project success, I thought I’d add my 2 cents in the
form of my observations. I would consider project success to be that the
software is delivered, the clients are satisfied with the result and
there were no surprises on time or budget (time/budget could be higher
than initially planned, but any slippage was identified and explained
well in advance). As a technical person, I also include the subjective
measure that the codebase would not cause embarrassment (no
<a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">WTFs</a> here).</p>

<p>Below are the some characteristics of successful projects I have seen,
in no particular order. None of them is sufficient by themselves and
I’ve seen projects succeed when some of these characteristics were
glaringly absent. However, I can’t remember seeing any project succeed
without more than a few of these present.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good People. If not the most factor important for success, certainly
the most important for enjoyment. I actually think that smart,
motivated people who want to get things done can ameliorate many
project difficulties. Thus forming a team of good developers should
be the first goal of any project. Note here I haven’t said “Smart
People”. While being smart certainly helps it’s is not everything (I
have a little disagreement with Google’s “only the best” hiring
practices here). On more than one occasion I have seen some very
smart people get tied up in irrelevancies and doing things “right”
resulting in nothing being done at all!</li>
  <li>Political Support or Cover. The senior management have to want the
project to succeed (not always a given in some political firms!).
Otherwise, the project will have problems getting the resources it
needs. Similarly in larger organisations a project needs to have
managerial support, both in terms of the problem being solved and
the manner it will be solved. I was once at a place where the senior
IT management were all old waterfall process COBOL coders and
distrusted iterative development. There was so much friction and so
many people just waiting to say “I told you so” (on both sides) that
forward movement was difficult. At another place with similarly
minded senior management, our immediate manager provided us with
cover. To higher management he presented reports conforming to their
waterfall style, but allowed us to run the project as we saw fit.</li>
  <li>Well Understood Problem. The more similar the problem being solved
is to previous problems the team has solved the more effectively
pitfalls will be avoided. This is one of the premises behind
prototyping - solve the exact same problem twice and the second time
should be much easier.</li>
  <li>Tight Iterations with End-user Interaction. I started commercial
work just as iterative development was becoming popular (we were
taught waterfall at university) and I’m a big believer. I have found
iterations lasting just a week or so (or as short as possible while
still getting some decent work in each iteration) and then deployed
to an environment where an end-user can see it (and hopefully try it
out) work best. The idea is to get regular and high quality feedback
on whether the project is heading in the right direction as well as
priorities for future work and changes required. Every project I
have been on has significantly changed requirements from start to
end. The chances for project success are greatly enhanced if change
is accepted and handled. Indeed the best option is to proactively
seek out the changes required and this is where short iterations
with user feedback help immensely.</li>
  <li>Small Teams. I was once on a project with over 100 other technical
people. The back and forth of meetings and coordination was
inordinately complex. I think Brooks had this right in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical
Man Month</a>, and
teams should be kept no larger than around 9 people. That number
seems to work well and if they are good people, a great deal can be
achieved. On that 100 person project, I strongly believe that the 9
best people in a single team would have done much, much better than
the other 91 as a team.</li>
  <li>Flexible Process. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/05/contect-in-software-developmen.html">I wrote about this
before</a>,
basically I think software projects work best where they are done by
people who look to understand their environment and can adapt - not
just retrying the same old thing that worked last time (for you or
someone else).</li>
