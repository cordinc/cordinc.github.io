<p>While holidaying in the Orkneys we ate dinner one night at <a href="http://www.thecreel.co.uk/">The
Creel</a>, regarded as one of the best
restaurants in Scotland (according to our guidebook). It also has a long
list of awards (AA rosettes, Good Food Guide and a Scottish Restaurant
Chef of The Year), most of which it displays on its walls. The menu is
quite simple and short - a choice of around four starters, with a
similar number of mains - all skewed heavily towards local seafood.</p>

<p>We had the scallops and a langoustine salad for starters. The scallops
were good (for what they were - I’m not a huge fan of that shellfish),
but the langoustines with orange and a pesto dressing on the salad were
excellent. For mains one of us had hake with squid and aubergine and the
other halibut with mashed cauliflower and peas. The halibut was just
about 30 seconds cooked beyond its best, but the hake was perfect. For
both the accompaniment were particular highlights. However, the one
issue was salt - there was way too much. This is something The Creel has
in common with nearly every restaurant we visited in Scotland, so
perhaps that is just the Scottish style. Still, to my palate it stopped
a very good dish becoming a great dish.</p>

<p>We had no dessert, and the whole meal came to £67 with a couple of
drinks. Very reasonable by London standards and not that much more than
some of the other places we visited while away. The service and decor
were fine. One thing to note though is that it is a small restaurant and
all the tables were taken when we were there on a Tuesday night -
booking is essential. Well worth a visit and I would try it again if in
the area.</p>

<p>As an aside, I would also like to say the lunch I had at the Skara Brae
Tourist Centre was excellent. It may just look like a standard canteen,
but the quality of the food is very high with friendly and helpful
staff. I almost drove back there a second time just for lunch. A hidden
gem, and if you are in Orkney it behoves you to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skara_Brae">Skara
Brae</a> and then eat lunch on
site (or take away).</p>
