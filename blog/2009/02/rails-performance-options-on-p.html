<br/><br/>
<p>I run a couple of Rails websites
(<a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">queuesaurus</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.cordinc.info/weather">past weather
forecasts</a>), both on a small 256MB
virtual host at <a href="http://www.slicehost.com">Slicehost</a>. As such I don’t
have a great deal of computing resources available to support two
resouce hogging apps. If you have visited either of those sites, you
will know that the first page view can take seemingly ages, but that
after that it speeds up. As I use <a href="http://www.modrails.com/">Phusion Passenger
(modrails)</a> to serve the apps through Apache,
I investigated some of the config options and how they affected
performance.</p>

<!--more-->

<p><strong>Setup</strong></p>

<p>My setup is a virtualised server with 256MB RAM running Apache2 with
Phusion Passenger 2.0.6. I have 2 Rails apps installed on the slice, but
for the purposes of this investigation I will only be using one. I
tested performance by running the same script a number of times for each
config options. Website response time was measured using the unix time
command on a wget call and memory usage was measured with the
<a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide.html#_inspecting_memory_usage">passenger-memory-stats</a>
command. The config options changed were (all other settings were left
with their defaults):</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide.html#PassengerPoolIdleTime">PassengerPoolIdleTime</a>:
this is set in /etc/apache2/apache2.conf and is the maximum number
of seconds an app can be idle before being shut down.</li>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/browse_thread/thread/43a735dd4e1748de?pli=1">FRAMEWORK_SPAWNER_MAX_IDLE_TIME</a>
in
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/lib/passenger/constants.rb,
is the number of seconds the framework spawner can be idle</li>
  <li><a href="http://groups.google.com/group/phusion-passenger/browse_thread/thread/43a735dd4e1748de?pli=1">APP_SPAWNER_MAX_IDLE_TIME</a>
in
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/lib/passenger/constants.rb,
is the number of seconds the app spawner can be idle</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How the system seems to work</strong></p>

<p>Firstly there seems to be an issue with the online non-official
documentation. <a href="http://wiki.github.com/FooBarWidget/passenger/wishlist">This
webpage</a> seems
to suggest that the RailsFrameworkSpawnerIdleTime &amp;
RailsAppSpawnerIdleTime config options can be set inside the apache
config file. I could not get this to work. If I tried setting them
anywhere other than the constants.rb file then I got errors on starting
Apache. The same documentation also suggests that setting these values
to 0 means they will not timeout. In my tests this was definitely not
the situation - set to 0 they timed out immediately! Instead I set them
to 999999 when I didn’t want them to timeout. Beware non-official online
documentation.</p>

<p>Passenger seems to have a Passenger Spawner which is always resident in
memory, and starts Framework Spawners as Passenger supports multiple web
frameworks (Rails, Merb, Sinatra, etc). Framework Spawners start App
Spawners so that multiple applications can be supported, and these App
Spawners starts instances of of the application (and puts them in the
instance pool) which handle actual user requests. Apart from the
Passenger Spawner, all these can be stopped after an idle period (see
the Setup section) to conserve memory. So it is possible that after a
period of inactivity, just to serve a single user request, Passenger
would need to start a Framework Spawner then an App Spawner then an app
instance before handling the request. This is why my low usage sites are
slow at first and then speed up. Here is the internal state of Passenger
after a long period of inactivity (with default settings):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">--------- Passenger processes ---------
22575  9        14.8 MB  0.1 MB   /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/ext/apache2/ApplicationPoolServerExecutable 0 /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/bin/passenger-spawn-server  /usr/bin/ruby1.8  /tmp/passenger_status.5364.fifo
22576  2        47.3 MB  0.7 MB   Passenger spawn server</code></pre></figure>

<p>and here it is again right after a request:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">-------- Passenger processes ----------
22575  9        14.8 MB   0.1 MB   /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/ext/apache2/ApplicationPoolServerExecutable 0 /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.0.6/bin/passenger-spawn-server  /usr/bin/ruby1.8  /tmp/passenger_status.5364.fifo

23788  1        139.4 MB  48.1 MB  Rails: /home/queuesaurus/public_html/wq</code></pre></figure>

<p>As can be seen it comes down to a tradeoff between speed and memory.
Having all the application instances running all the time would take a
lot of memory. Starting them as required takes time. The tests I ran
attempted to quantify this tradeoff, setting the idle config options to
various values such that Passenger was in a variety of states when a
user request arrived.</p>

<p><strong>Results</strong></p>

<p>The first task was to create an upper and lower bound for my user
requests. On a just started Passenger (with the memory profile like the
first example above - nothing running apart from the Passenger Spawner),
a certain user request took 10.9 seconds (average over 10 runs), the
same user request made a minute after the first took 0.12 seconds. There
was no caching in the system, so the majority of the 10.8 second
difference is probably in starting up the Framework Spawner, Application
Spawner and an instance (the memory profile was like the second example
above - everything running).</p>

<p>Next I tried to isolate the starting of the various components. If I had
the Framework Spawner running, but not the App Spawner or an instance
then it took an average of 4.5 seconds to start them and respond. If a
Framework and App Spawner were running then it took around 2 seconds to
start an instance and respond. If there was an instance running at the
time of a user request it normally took under a second to respond,
although occasionally took upto 5 seconds. I couldn’t get the App
Spawner running by itself. If the Framework Spawner stopped then so did
the App Spawner regardless of their idle timeouts - strange.</p>

<p>The situations where just an application instance is running deserves
greater examination. Most of the time I saw this
(PassengerPoolIdleTime=999999, others left with default value):</p>

<p>That is after a period of inactivity (32 minutes in the example above)
there is still an instance running and it responds quickly to the
request. Sometimes I saw this after the same 32 of inactivity
(PassengerPoolIdleTime=999999, APP_SPAWNER_MAX_IDLE_TIME=1,
FRAMEWORK_SPAWNER_MAX_IDLE_TIME at default):</p>

<p>Here the query took much longer, but nothing was started. The time seems
to have been taken by the application instance itself in getting started
again. Note the difference in starting memory. In the first example the
instance has 35MB allocated before and after the query. In the second
the instance has 0.3MB before and 5MB after. I saw a similar scenario
with the spawners. If they never timed out then sometimes after a long
period of time they would decrease resident memory usage and then take a
long time to recover when action was required. Thus even if the the
config settings are set to very large values, this is no guarantee that
the components will react quickly, just increase the probability that
they will. The only way to be sure memory is not being freed and that a
component is fast is to exercise that component (for the spawners by
creating application instances, and for application instances by
responding to requests).</p>

<p>As for memory usage, I found that Framework and Application Spawners
used about as much resident memory each as an application instance.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>It is important that you get an understanding of how much load your
system has and play around with your settings to match your situation.
If I had a high load website (with enough memory), I could have the
spawners running all the time (setting their idle time to 999999) along
with a set of long-lived application instances (PassengerPoolIdleTime a
multiple of a normal user session time). Then the constant hits would
keep starting up instances and keeping them active, with the spawners
able to quickly respond to changes in load.</p>

<p>I have a low load website, there is rarely more than a couple of people
using it at once. Furthermore I only have 256MB of memory to play with.
At this level it is not really worth having the spawners running, as
each means that one less application instance can run. So I have roughly
calculated how many instances I can have running at one and estimated 4
rails applications instances (roughly 48M each = 192M out of 256
available). Thus set
<a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide.html#_passengermaxpoolsize_lt_integer_gt">PassengerMaxPoolSize</a>
to 4 and split equally between my two apps with
<a href="http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide.html#_passengermaxinstancesperapp_lt_integer_gt">PassengerMaxInstancesPerApp</a>
set to 2. Then PassengerPoolIdleTime was set to 999999, to ensure the
instances would never time out. As this setup would quickly hit the
maximum pool size the spawners won’t be used, thus both
APP_SPAWNER_MAX_IDLE_TIME &amp; FRAMEWORK_SPAWNER_MAX_IDLE_TIME are
1 so they timeout straight away.</p>

<p>To ensure the application instances don’t release too much memory there
is a cronscript running every 20 minutes to make a user request. Unless
you have a constant heavy load website I think this is a good idea to
keep initial response times low.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: It seems just making the same user request every 20 minutes
with cron doesn’t properly keep the memory allocated in the instances. I
am going to have to update the cron script to make a random query, as I
think the current ones might be cached somewhere.</p>
