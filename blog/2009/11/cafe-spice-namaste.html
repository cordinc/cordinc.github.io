<p>My mobile phone company recently gave me a two-for-one dinner voucher.
Most of the qualifying venues were high-end fast food chains, but
looking through the list I spotted a little gem - <a href="http://www.cafespice.co.uk/">Cafe Spice
Namaste</a>. I had heard a few things about
this Indian restaurant near Tower Bridge, so was keen to give it a try.
We went along on a Wednesday night and there were quite a few people
there, suggesting a booking would definitely be necessary on more
popular nights. The polite head waiter spent some time checking the
voucher as we were apparently the first people to use such a voucher
there. Once that was sorted out we ordered.</p>

<p>The menu was a little different to the standard Indian. For a start it
was much shorter, just a few dishes, rather than the numerous curry
combinations found elsewhere. We had poppadoms for starters followed by
lamb shank and spiced partridge with naan and a potato/cauliflower/pea
side dish. The food was very good. The poppadoms and chutneys were
noticeably nicer than other places. My lamb shank was beautifully cooked
and the slightly spiced sauce very more’ish - when I finished my plate
was clean. The off-the-bone partridge was equally good. The portions
were a good size and after that lot (plus some beer) we were too full
for dessert. Although seeing the Belgian chocolate icecream at the next
table tempted us, we did not waver and got the bill.</p>

<p>The service was very fast and efficient. It was more expensive than
other Indian places, but also far better. Although, it was by no means
expensive by general London standards, a little over £60 before the
voucher discount (and including service). For comparison, the next best
Indian restaurant I’ve been is
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/fancy-restaurants-part-deux.html">Babur</a>.
Without a discount Cafe Spice Namaste is a little more expensive than
Babur, but with better food (thanks to the poppadoms) and easily better
service. This is definitely a place I’ll be visiting again.</p>
