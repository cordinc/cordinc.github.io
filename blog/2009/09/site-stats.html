<br/><br/>
<p>I want to talk about this blog. Yes, it has been said <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001282.html">Meta Is
Murder</a>, and I
generally agree with that post. However, I originally started this blog
to motivate myself in my personal software development and learn about
internet publishing. This post will be about the latter (in the form of
this blog) and a later post will deal with the former.</p>

<p>Since the first post 20 months ago on February 5th 2008, there have been
71 posts on this blog. An average of 3.5 per month. There has been a
single comment and a single trackback (although there have been many
spam versions of both, but I deleted them). I also set up Google
<a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/">Analytics</a> and
<a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/">Adsense</a> to track visits. At first very
few people visited the blog - 20 visitors in the first months, 3 of whom
were me! Since then the number of visitors has slowly increased. As of
midnight yesterday there have been a total of 14,000 unique vistors
resulting in 19,000 page views. The below statistics are for the last
month.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/meta/blogstats.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>The most popular blog posts are the technical ones. Around 55% of the
traffic comes to 3 pages: <a href="/blog/2008/03/installing-sphinx-ultrasphinx.html">Installing Sphinx &amp; Ultrasphinx on
Windows</a>; <a href="/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-">Multiple
Attachments with Validations In Rails with
Paperclip</a> with-vali.html; and, the
<a href="/projects/tooltips.html">Prototype Tooltip Library</a>. The rest of the
top ten are also all technically based. People mainly find these pages
through Google - a full 76% of visitors originate from a Google search.
Note my specification of Google, all other search engines combined
account for 1% of visits.</p>

<p>One month stands out as particularly exceptional. After publishing
<a href="/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-with-vali.html">Multiple Attachments with Validations In Rails with
Paperclip</a> I sent an
email to the <a href="http://railsenvy.com/">Ruby Envy</a> guys and they made a
positive mention of the article (that was a real buzz). The result was
immediate, noticeable and unfortunately short lived. The blog went from
around 40 visits a day to over 300 in a single day. This is the only
promotion of the blog I have done.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/meta/rubyenvy_boost.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>So how much money does advertising on the blog generate? Not much. I
have made a total of £3.09 through 20 clicks on ads. This is a Click
Through Rate of 0.11, which is about right as I’m told one should expect
a rate around 0.1. Last month was the best month ever - making £0.81.
Long may that continue. At that rate I will be able to cash out the
money earned in just under 6 years (minimum balance of £60 before
actually being paid any money).</p>

<p>The short lesson is write technical articles that are easily found
through Google and self-promote.</p>
