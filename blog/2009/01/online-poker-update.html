<h4>Online Poker Update</h4>

<p>Urgh, overconfidence is a killer. I have now completed the 50 online $2+0.20 heads-up tournaments I <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/11/how-to-make-1hour-playing-onli.html">previously
mentioned</a>.
You may remember my goal was to win 70. Well, I didn’t make it. The good
news is I won more than I lost - 52. The bad news is that with entrance
fees, a win rate of 55% is required to break even. I lost $6 and so
ended up with $66; a little disappointing.</p>

<p>It all started so badly. I’d like to think it was just variance - that
the luck of the cards means that sometimes you are just going to lose.
However, reading that goal-setting blog post and remembering those first
few games, I think I might have been overconfident. I improved a little
over time. If I played the first 25 like the second 25, then I would
have made a small profit, but still a long way from the 70% goal.</p>

<p>Like my first posting, I think the main problem is my attitude. While
playing this 50 I kept a record of whether I considered I played “well”
or “badly”, together with the final result. My definition of playing
badly included: not starting in an appropriate frame of mind; getting
disheartened during the match; chasing pots; or bluffing too much even
when the other player was betting back. Those are my main vices. Just
today I played a match where after I ground the other player down for 10
minutes, I went all in on the turn with a full house and then lost on a
2-outer as they made a slightly better full house on the river! Despite
still having a playable stack (around 30BB), I was tilted and busted
stupidly a few hands later. That was badly played. Playing well meant I
played mostly calmly the entire match, allowing a few small bad hands as
long as they were non-terminal. Notably, the maths of poker did not
count for much in categorisation. If both players went all in pre-flop
after just a few hands (a surprisingly common experience), then it was
considered well played if I was ahead at the start (the normal
situation). One game defied categorisation as the other player
disappeared after 2 hands and had to be blinded out. Thus there were 49
entries.</p>

<p>I played well 59% of the time. When playing well I won 72% of the time.
When playing badly I won only 20% of the time. Even allowing a bias
towards saying I played well if I won and badly if I lost, that is still
a big difference. Playing badly 40% of the time is way too high. If I
played well every match, as I should, then I would be close to my
original goal. So the goal for the next 50 is to win 30 (60), by playing
well 80 of the time. To that end, here is my beginner’s advice (from a
beginner to a beginner), which I will try to follow over the next 50:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decide before starting how many matches you want to play - many
times the “just one more” game was a bad loss.</li>
  <li>Only play if you want to win and can play for the 30 minutes or more
it can take.</li>
  <li>Don’t chase pots, especially if your opponent is betting back.</li>
  <li>Think about what your opponent has - remember 50% of the time they
have a better pre-flop hand.</li>
  <li>Start tight with small bets until you get an idea of your opponent.
If they are tight don’t bluff too much when they bet back (beware
even if they are loose and aggressive). However, be aware people’s
style changes with stack size.</li>
  <li>If you play a hand badly, don’t dwell on it, but do think about
these guidelines.</li>
  <li>If you lose badly, stop.</li>
</ul>
