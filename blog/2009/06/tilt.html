<br/><br/>
<p>I’ve been playing a little poker since <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/02/last-online-poker-update.html">my earlier decision not to play
seriously</a> - not much, just a few games now and again. I lost a little, then won a
lot, stayed steady for a bit and now I’m on another losing streak. One
thing I’ve learnt is that I’m a worse tilter than I thought. I lose most
of my games the same way. It seems to be a mental issue and it’s driving
me crazy. It would be easy to handle if I thought it was just bad luck
or my opponent was a better player.</p>

<p>Here is an example from early in a $2.20 heads-up tournament, too early
to get a good read on my opponent.<br />
Board:<br />
Me (BB): $1,440<br />
Them (Button): $1,560</p>

<p>Dealt to me: 10 7 off</p>

<p>Pre-flop:<br />
They raise to $60, I call $40<br />
[At this early stage I’m not sure what they could have, but probably a
pocket pair or Ax. I decide to call and just see. If I miss the flop I’d
probably check-fold]</p>

<p>Flop: ($120) Q 10 7<br />
I bet $80, they call $80<br />
[Oh yeah, I was feeling good here. Pretty sure I had the better hand.]</p>

<p>Turn: ($280) K<br />
I bet $200, they call $200<br />
[Now I’m getting a little worried. Ax has a straight draw and the
chance of trips or a higher two pair are increased. However, I still
think I’m ahead]</p>

<p>River: ($680) J</p>

<p>At this point any Ax hand has made a straight. Chances are I’m probably
behind. A bet could be justified just to see if there is any resistance,
but it would have to be fairly large in terms of my stack. Probably the
worst possible action is to go all-in. In that situation my opponent
would probably fold if I was ahead and call if I was behind.</p>

<p>I went all-in, they had A9s and the game was over. I knew going all-in
was a bad decision before I did it, but that didn’t stop me. Why? This
is an egregious example, but certainly not an isolated example. I do
this all the time. Just a few days earlier I was in a 3000 person
tournament (it was free to enter) where the top 10% won money. After
playing very well for over an hour there were 360 players left - a
number decreasing at a 5/minute rate. With a nearly 30BB stack, I had
over double the average. I could probably have just walked away from my
laptop and still made the money. Instead I blew it all in 3 consecutive
hands. The first hand was an acceptable loss, the other guy got lucky
with his 3 outer on the river. The second was bad and the third was
awful.</p>

<p>I’m getting the impression poker is a game of gathering information. You
start with knowledge of your hole cards, but no knowledge of your
adversary’s cards or the community cards to come. You need to gain
information for the least cost and greatest gain - goals which are often
opposed. When all-in there is no possibility of gaining more
information; your opponent has all the choices. Rarely will they call
with a bad hand. There are occasions when it is good to go all in: if
you have the best possible hand and your opponent is still betting big;
or preflop if you have a very good hand and have a stack several times
your opponent’s. In general I think it is a tactic to be used sparingly.
I wrote that last sentence as a note to myself over a month ago, I know
better than to go all-in on what is bearly more than a whim.</p>

<p>If I know better, why do I keep making these obvious mistakes. I have a
few ideas. It could be the thrill of catching a bluff, or it could be a
lack of patience, or trying to dominate a game and refusing to
acknowledge a losing hand. However, I have no problem concentrating for
hours at a time in other areas of my life. I’m aware that my opponent
will have the best hand 50% of the time on average and that luck plays a
large part in poker, so controlling it is hard. Also, I tend to play
well if I’m ahead or grinding out a game. Thus, while all the above may
play a part I think it may be caused by losing interest if the game
isn’t going in my favour - sometimes this manifests itself as an all-in
and sometimes as generally bad play.</p>

<p>I think when not tilting I’m an ok player, but definitely not a good
player. When I read other online posts they are thinking about things
that don’t occur to me during the 30 seconds I have to make a decision
in an online game. However, I don’t think that matters until I get over
the tilt problem and go up a level to better opponents. That is why this
matters to me and I’m writing a long blog post about it. If it was just
a matter of not knowing the game well enough I could leave it. It would
be a matter of accepting the game would take too long to learn well.
Instead, I consider it a personal flaw that I’m not able to stay
rational and maintain concentration until the end of the game. I want to
beat the flaw, then I can decide whether I want to beat the game.</p>

<p>Having read a couple of
<a href="http://www.tightpoker.com/articles/stay_off_tilt.html">online</a>
<a href="http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=microplnl&amp;Number=12528288&amp;page=48&amp;fpart=1">articles</a>
on overcoming tilt, they suggest: identifying when tilt is occurring;
stop playing when tilting; overcome the origins of the tilt. I can
identify my tilt, so the first step is covered. Stopping play is harder
because when I lose as a result of tilting I want to play more, whereas
when I win I’m happy to stop (is that normal?). I just have to force
myself to stop for an hour at least, which would normally mean I don’t
play again that day. Another part of this is to not set goals around
amount won or games to play. I have noticed my tilting gets worse if I
feel some pressure to play, regardless of whether I am on track to meet
the goal or not. I need to play only if I want to for my own pleasure.
To that end I will not play online for a while to build my interest
again. Lastly, I need to focus on logical play. Reading online postings
to see how other players think through hands will help. Similarly with
reading the hand histories of my own games - it’s a bit like rubbing my
nose in it:) I won’t set any plans or goals around overcoming tilt, just
keep a record of how I perform.</p>

<p>Onward!</p>
