    <p>Recently the Blender 2.5x series was properly released (as opposed to

significant changes since the old 2.4x releases, so to learn the new

  <div class="content">
    <p>After some previous work <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/08/java-nio-server-example.html">building Java NIO
servers</a>,
there was still some question over the performance of the system
created. Here are the results from a number of tests I ran, to see how
such a server would handle connection and message storms.</p>

<p>The code from the previous blog article was modified so that there was a
single-threaded selector to handle initial connections, but it handed
off the message processing to a number of other selectors running in a
thread pool. All of the tests were run on my 4-core Win7 64-bit desktop
(full <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/01/building-a-new-pc.html">specs
here</a>). All
programs (both client and server components) were run through
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> Helios using JDK1.6.0.24, always with
256MB of heap space and no other VM options set. The code is not (yet)
available online, but it shouldn’t be too hard to work out a rough
understanding from the previous article and some Java NIO knowledge.</p>

<p>Firstly, I wanted to check the system could handle a storm of
connections. The test code would fire off 10,000 connections either: 1
per millisecond; as fast as it could in 1 thread; or as far as it could
with 5 threads sharing the load. The average time to reach various code
points were recorded and results are in the table below. The Accept
column is the time from when the connection is first received by the
server to just after the server accepts the connection. The Server
column is the time from when the connection is first received by the
server until it completes all actions on the connection - this is the
Accept column plus time spent initialising message processing. The
Client column is the time from when the client opens a connection until
it receives notification it is ready. Also during these tests I tracked
heap usage and it barely budged - an extra few MB on a system that was
already using 30MB after initialisation. All the heap gain was reversed
after the next GC. No problems there.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Connection Speed</th>
      <th>Accept (ms)</th>
      <th>Server (ms)</th>
      <th>Client (ms)</th>
      <th>Client Max (ms)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Sequential throttled</td>
      <td>0.15</td>
      <td>0.68</td>
      <td>0.19</td>
      <td>1.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Sequential unthrottled</td>
      <td>0.07</td>
      <td>0.48</td>
      <td>3.90</td>
      <td>507.93</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>5 Threads unthrottled</td>
      <td>0.07</td>
      <td>0.51</td>
      <td>31.83</td>
      <td>510.22</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><br />As can be seen the Accept and Server times are fairly steady (I
would guess 0.07 milliseconds is the fastest a selector can accept a
connection on average). However, the faster the connections are created,
the greater the lag at the client. No connections were dropped. I
imagine the client delays are caused by some queuing. Possibly in the
PC’s networking, but more likely in the wait before the selector starts
processing the connection. In all the above tests the selector wait time
is 1 millisecond, so the server will not wait long for a connections. I
tried setting the wait time to 0, but some connections were then
dropped. I also increased the wait time, and unsurprisingly this only
increased the response time.</p>

<p>Speeding up the server code after the accept (ie, trying to decrease the
Server column) could speed up acceptance by decreasing the time before
the server is ready to process the next connection. This code could be
moved into another thread, but then I’m not sure what would happen if a
message arrived on a connection that hadn’t finished. I also looked at
the cost of selector creation by having each connection create a
selector just for itself. In this scenario the time taken increased, but
more importantly the server crashed having run out of heap after 641
connections (the old generation filled up). I would estimate that each
selector requires around 0.25 MB of heap.</p>

<p>Next to test the message processing. The client created 10,000
connections and once they were accepted each connection sent 10 message
(for a total of 100,000 unique messages). The server just reflected the
message back to the client. The client checked each message returned
from the server was as expected (all messages were present and correct)
and recorded total time taken. The variables in the tests were the
number of selectors processing messages and the number of threads
handling those selectors. The results are below. During all tests the
heap didn’t grow to more than 55MB (from a 30MB base).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/nio_messages.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>The rule seems to be that the more selectors the better and there should
be roughly the same number of threads as selectors (it may be easier to
see in the raw numbers). More threads than selectors does no good at
all. I checked a few points further out, 7 selectors/7 threads and
10/10. They were quicker on average, but showed decreasing returns as
they were both 1.26 milliseconds on average. However, the standard
deviation also grew to around 2ms, when for all the other tests it was
around 1ms (perhaps due to the extra thread scheduling in the VM)</p>

<p>This such a system should handle connection and message storms short of
a concerted
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">DDOS</a> attack.
For performance the rule seems to be pre-build as many message handling
selectors as you wish and then provide about one thread per selector to
support them.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Java.html">Java</a>, 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Technical.html">Technical</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization">Serialization</a> is a useful
feature built into Java. It converts objects into a bytestream that can
be saved to a file or transmitted over a network and then reconstructed
later into the same object (perhaps in a different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Virtual_Machine">Java
VM</a>). The basics are
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Programming/serialization">detailed
here</a>,
with some more <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/serialization/">advanced features
here</a>
and the <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/platform/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html">complete API is
here</a>.
Despite all this documentation, I recently came a across a problem not
described. What if an object being deserialized requires a reference to
some non-serializable object in the<br />
application. That is how can an object be reconstructed when it contains
part of the application’s context that can’t be serialized. For
instance, what if the object has a network connection as a member
variable. The network connection can not be meaningfully serialized, so
when the object is deserialized it has somehow reconnect itself to the
network, which requires some reference to the network context. This may
sound like a contrived example, but it occurs in the <a href="http://www.reddwarfserver.org/">Red Dwarf
Server</a> (previously known as Sun’s
Darkstar project) where network connections are transparently moved
around a server cluster.</p>

<p>The best way to solve this problem is to ensure that the serializable
objects are self-contained and do not need any outside context when
deserialized. Let’s assume that is not possible and move on. Next best
is to hook the object to its required context immediately after the
deserialization. However, this may not be practicable because the
deserialized object is not easily accessible (for example, if it is deep
in an object graph - which is the case in Red Dwarf and my code).</p>

<p>Red Dwarf solves the problem by defining a static accessor on the
context class and then on the serializable object adding a serialization
override method like the below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">readObject</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">ObjectInputStream</span> <span class="n">in</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="kd">throws</span> <span class="nc">Exception</span> <span class="o">{</span>
  <span class="n">in</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">defaultReadObject</span><span class="o">();</span>
  <span class="k">this</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">contextObject</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getContextObject</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="o">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This solution works, but I don’t like it. Creating a static context
makes it hard to write tests and add a second context if required (I
have been caught out by this before). It could improved by making the
static context use
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/ThreadLocal.html">ThreadLocal</a>
storage, but there are other ways.</p>

<p>Checking out the <a href="http://www.java2s.com/Open-Source/Java-Document/6.0-JDK-Core/io-nio/java/io/ObjectInputStream.java.htm">Java serialization source
code</a>,
I thought there may be some way of extending the deserialization
process. The main extension points seem to be the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">readObject(ObjectInputStream in)</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">writeObject(ObjectOutputStream in)</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">readResolve()</code> methods added to the serializable object. These are
found by reflection on their signature in a private method and can not
be changed. There is a method <code class="highlighter-rouge">readObjectOverride()</code> on
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/io/ObjectInputStream.html#readObjectOverride()">ObjectInputStream</a>,
which allows a bespoke deserialization process to be defined. However,
so many of the methods on ObjectInputStream are private that this would
be like writing a new process from scratch.</p>

<p>There are two other options. The ObjectInputStream can be subclassed and
contain a reference to the context object. This new class can detected
within <code class="highlighter-rouge">readObject(ObjectInputStream in)</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">instanceof</code> and the
context dereferenced. An alternative is to keep the subclass of
ObjectInputStream and set <code class="highlighter-rouge">enableResolveObject(true)</code> in the constructor
(this requires the program to have security permission). This means that
after deserialization the <code class="highlighter-rouge">resolveObject(Object obj)</code> method on the
stream subclass will be called and the return value passed as the final
result of the deserialization. Thus this method can perform extra
initialisation or even replace the given object with a different one.
The code below shows both these techniques - you probably only want to
use one at a time.</p>

    <p>It was always my plan at university to do honours - it was a step on the
way to a PhD. The Computer Science degree at <a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au/">The University of Western
Australia</a> was nominally a three year degree,
but a small number of students with good grades were invited to do a
fourth year in order to graduate “with honours”. I got the required
grades and thus got an invitation to do the extra year. Fourteen other
students did the same out of a third-year class of just over 100. A few
good students who must have had invitations refused - I knew a couple of
them, including one who got very good grades. Although on the whole, the
honours class was representative of the better students in our year.
That year I worked harder than I ever had before (but have a couple of
times more since). I needed to achieve 1st class (the highest grade
available) to stand a good chance of getting into the PhD program. This
is the story of that year.</p>

<p>The well-known story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_of_Rome">Rome’s
Foundation</a> is that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_and_Remus">Romulus and Remus</a>
(descendants of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, a prince
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy">Troy</a>) were abandoned as infants,
suckled by a she-wolf and founded the city with Romulus killing Remus in
an argument over the exact location of the new city. There is apparently
some evidence of other slightly different foundation myths, where other
families take a more prominent role. The myth in its current form became
dominant during the reign of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a> who claimed ancestry
from Romulus. Augustus was adept at manipulating Rome’s foundation myths
to help consolidate power in himself and his family.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius">Suetonius</a> writes that as an
alternative to Augustus, Octavian was offered the name Romulus as the
second founder of Rome.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Augustus">House of Augustus</a>
is the first artifact examined. Presented by Augustus as a small
domestic building, its location was further reinforced his connection
with the gods and foundation myths. It is on the

temples and close to the

Remus were supposedly found by the she-wolf. In 13BC the Roman Senate
commissioned the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ara_Pacis">Ara Pacis</a>, an
altar to honour Augustus for bringing peace to Rome. It is the subject
of one of the podcasts and again links Augustus to the foundation myths.
The altar displays scenes of nature, Rome’s foundation and a religious
procession including the figure of Augustus himself. Augustus is also
connected to the last classical object investigated - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_Niger">Lapis
Niger</a>. This artifact is a
number of black basalt paving stones covering an important shrine in the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comitium">Comitium</a> area of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum">Roman
Forum</a>. Although it is not
known what exactly the stones cover, it is know that the site is of
archaic importance in the city’s foundation.</p>

<p>It was originally though that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitoline_Wolf">Capitoline
Wolf</a> (the famous status
of Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf) was classical or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization">Etruscan</a>. However,
it is now known that the wolf statue probably dates from the medieval
period, with the twins added during the renaissance. Still the statue’s
image is plastered all over Rome as a symbol of the city as the
traditional seat of power, even in modern Italy. Many people have used
the foundation myths. In the 17th century the Popes had the d’Arpino
frescoes painted in the salon of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palazzo_dei_Conservatori#Palazzo_dei_Conservatori">Palazzo dei
Conservatori</a>
by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Cesari">Giuseppe Cesari</a>.
These paintings are detailed in the last of the artifact podcasts. They
depict scenes in the foundation of Rome together with a large statue of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Innocent_X">Pope Innocent X</a>.</p>

<p>The artifact podcasts are interesting, but most of the others can be
skipped if already seen as part of a previous Open University course on
myth.</p>
