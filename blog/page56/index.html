<p>For the last six years I have developed software for the bonds desks of
Investment Banks (usually the European Government Bonds desk). Now it is
time to move on into a different business area. So I have decided to
write some notes on the business and software of bond trading as I have
witnessed it - starting here with the basics.</p>

Podcasts</a></p>

<p>This series provides a brief introduction to a number of current topics
researched or studied in the Classics department at <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/">Warwick
University</a>. The 10 audio-only podcasts are
in the format of an interview discussing the topic at hand. Episodes
range in length from 21 to 36 minutes. The production quality is
generally good, although on the “Graeco-Arabic Studies” episode the
audio cuts outs a couple of times. One of the episodes, “The Golden Age
of Islam”, is in Arabic so I was unable to understand it.</p>

<p>The podcasts range across a number of disparate topics. There is a
discussion of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numismatics">Numismatics</a> -
which for classical studies effectively means coins. Coinage was first
minted in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia">Lydia</a> (in modern day
Turkey) around 650BC, and spread quickly. Coins were traditionally made
from valuable metals (gold and silver). However to be able to mint more
money, the coins were regularly debased. During the 3rd century AD the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denarius">denarius</a> went from being 50%
silver to 1.5% silver. Another podcast (Medicine and Classicism in a
Comparative Perspective) looks at how medicine claims classic roots in
ancient works and commentaries, like those of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galen">Galen</a>. Apparently Indian and
Chinese medicine have similar traditions. Old classical medical books
(and alchemy texts) were among the first texts translated into Arabic as
the classical world collapsed, as stated in the Graeco-Arabic Studies
podcast.</p>

<p>A quip during Drinking Parties in Ancient Greece podcast proposes that
classics is really just the history of drinking. This episode describes
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium">Symposium</a>; drinking
parties in ancient Greece. Apparently the dancing girls were regularly
in danger of being groped. The Sex in the Ancient World episode suggests
such dancers must have been disreputable women, as higher class Greek
women were neither heard nor seen. Homosexuality in ancient Greek
society is also mentioned. There is some debate as to whether the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pederasty">pederastic</a> relationship in
ancient Greece was considered homosexual in the way we understand it
today or just a traditional cultural institution.</p>

<p>Other episodes deal with the role of logic in the renaissance; Roman
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elegy">elegiac poetry</a>; and epic poetry
(subtitled “Homer to Virgil”, it could be retitled “Homer and Virgil” as
these are the only two poets mentioned). There is also a short biography
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a> while discussing
his autobiographical mausoleum inscription, referred to as the Queen of
Inscriptions. Apparently the original is now lost, but three copies
exist in modern Turkey.</p>

    <p>I recently returned from a holiday in Turkey. While there I visited the
ancient ruined Roman city of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus">Ephesus</a>. At its peak in the 1st
century AD it had a population of over 250,000, but there is not a great
deal of evidence for that extent now. Although it did feel like there
are nearly that many people present when we visited.The best photos are
now a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157627739847990/show/">set on Flickr, available

    <p>When I first arrived in London, one of the great mysteries I faced was
the difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">England</a>,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a> , and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain">Great
Britain</a>. This is of no
small concern to the people of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales">Wales</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</a>. I almost found myself
attacked when I accidently (and mistakenly) referred to a famous Welsh
footballer as English - only claiming a foreigner’s ignorance saved me.
After a while I learnt the difference: England, Wales and Scotland are
all countries; the UK is the international state (thus it is the UK
government); and Great Britain is the name of the island.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Turkey on holiday I saw the following sign. Initially
I couldn’t find the UK, as it is out of alphabetical order. Then I
realised that it would be in alphabetical order if the label was for
England. If you look closely you can see the United Kingdom label is
actually a sticker. I would bet that underneath is England. Good to see
my confusion is shared by some governments. I can just image the regular
rants from Scottish and Welsh people that led to them correcting the
name!</p>
