    <p>Available on
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=387973532">iTunes</a>
and <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulearn/arts-and-humanities/podcast-a330-nemi">OU
Podcasts</a></p>

<p>These podcasts were produced as part of <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open
University</a> course <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a330.htm">A330: Myth in the Greek and
Roman
Worlds</a>.
However, it just concentrates on a single example, the artifacts found
at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Nemorensis">Temple of Diana at
Nemi</a>, popular in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Ancient Rome</a>. The series is
composed of 8 episodes, although only 4 of these are on the temple. The
remainder are introductions or discussions on context. The 4 temple
podcasts are video slideshows of photos with narration describing what
is being shown. The video podcasts are all around 5 minutes long (50MB)
and recorded at 640x360 resolution, or a smaller iPod optimised format.
Transcripts are available in PDF format.</p>

<p>Very little of the original temple and sanctuary still exists at Nemi,
so these podcasts look at four of the items found on the site. There is
a podcast devoted to a model of a temple, about which not much is known.
Perhaps it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votive_offering">votive
offering</a> like the small
sculpture of a women with some internal organs visible. Apparently
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_(mythology)">Diana</a> was
not just the goddess of the hunt, but also had a healing aspect,
especially for women. Thus when ill, Roman people may turn to Diana and
leave votive offerings representing their ailment to aid their recovery.
Another offering is an oil lamp decorated with what may be a proud
statement of profession - a painting of a street entertainer with his
monkey and cat. This is a low status profession, but gifts to the gods
(and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/08/roman-funerary-monuments.html">funerary
monuments</a>)
were the main way the poor and slaves could celebrate their backgrounds.
Hence the stern statue of his ex-owner paid for by a freed slave. The
narration proposes the statue is constructed in an archaic style, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herma">herm</a>, so as to suggest the
ex-owner as almost an ancestor to the ex-slave.</p>

<p>The non-temple episodes introduce the series and discuss the role of
myth in the ancient world. Myth surrounded the population and provided
purpose and entertainment. There is also some talk about how classical
myths have continued through the ages and still influence us now. These
episodes add little to historical understanding, instead justifying the
course in a modern context.</p>

<p>The temple artifact episodes are interesting, but not vital viewing.</p>

    <p>A <a href="/blender/tutorials/mech/5_ogre/index.html">previous tutorial</a> showed
how to create a simple program allowing control of a mech model using
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Ogre3D</a> (the mech model was created separately
in <a href="/blender/tutorials/mech/4_animating/index.html">this tutorial</a>). Now
it is time to add a little more functionality to that program and create
a simple shooting game. In this tutorial we will place some other
objects on the screen that our mech will need to manoeuvre around. Thus
some collision detection is also required. To provide some competition,
a computer controlled opposing mech is added. Lastly, the mechs are
given the ability to fire lasers at each other - the first to score a
hit wins.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My first “proper’ish” job was IT consulting for a small publisher that
shall remain nameless. I had paying work before, temping for a warehouse
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock-taking">stocktake</a> and as a teaching
assistant at university, but I never considered them jobs. In order to
provide a little structure to my memories posts I’m going to go through
my work and education experiences, starting with that publisher.</p>

<p>In early 1997 I began thinking that perhaps a PhD wasn’t right for me
and started perusing the University job board. There was a part-time
position to create an online presence for a publisher at a rate only a
student could consider acceptable. It was a perfect opportunity for me
to see what the world of work was like. Previously I thought I would
stay in academia forever. Thus in early 1997 I ended up in the one room
office of a small publisher with surprisingly high profitability based
on the back of low costs in Australia and high sales in America.</p>

<p>The firm was run by a nice middle aged couple, publishing books of what
essentially amounted to tables of data. They gave me a copy of their
latest book and I immediately saw the potential for them on the then
burgeoning web. They weren’t so interested in that, or at least they
acted cool on the idea. Instead I spent the next few weeks (a few hours
per week) hooking up the office computers to a local ISP, training
everyone on the Internet (email, web, some basic html, etc) and creating
a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brochureware">brochureware</a> web
presence. One exchange sticks in my memory. I asked about their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>. “Database, what’s
that?” “Where do you keep the data you publish?” “Oh, you mean
”Quark“:http://www.quark.com/.” It turns out they kept all the data
tables as text in their publishing system.</p>

<p>The most interested person in the office was the owner’s son. At the
time the public was just becoming aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dotcom
boom</a>. He clearly wanted to
make a mark on the world and saw the possibilities in his parents’
business. One day he said he had a great idea. We could scrape the
Internet for email addresses and send all of them ads for their books. I
told him about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)">spam</a> and
that I didn’t want to do that. There were a few other strange
conversations and I always felt a little uneasy around him.</p>

<p>The experience scared me back to my studies, but only for a while. After
sixth months, I left my PhD permanently and started fulltime at
Electrolley (but that is a whole other story). A few years later I
bumped into the son again at the shops (just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#The_bubble_bursts">dotcom
bust</a>).
He said they had employed a few students to build a site for the
publisher and it was going well. No mention of the other stuff. I
checked out their site and it did indeed look good and useful. For a fee
you could subscribe to the site and get personalised access to their
data. I looked again just before writing this and they still exist and
have gone even farther, with more features including most recently
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad">iPad</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>
apps. Yet I have never regretted leaving.</p>

    <p>Available on <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-4229362271242931182">Google
Video</a></p>

<p>Murder in Rome is not a podcast like I normally review. It is a TV
program produced by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> as part of its
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjlw">Timewatch</a> history
documentary series (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0954240/">IMDB entry</a>).
Copies of the video are easily found through an online search; I watched
the version (obviously a TV capture) that has been on Google Video for
three years, so is presumably legit. The show is 46 minutes long and the
story is told mainly through an acted reconstruction of historical
events. There is occasional documentary style narration to provide
context - viewers with little background information will not get lost.
The acting is good, if you watch much British TV you will no doubt
recognise a few of the actors.</p>

<p>The show is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero">Cicero’s</a>
defence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Roscius">Sextus Roscius</a> - accused of murdering his father in 81BC. Cicero went on to become a
consul and prominent figure in the fall of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Republic</a>. Many of
Cicero’s writings from this time still exist, including his account of
this trial (<a href="http://www.uah.edu/student_life/organizations/SAL/texts/latin/classical/cicero/proamerino1e.html">available
here</a>).
The script is primarily drawn from this source. Some other references
are found in a list of known Roman trials <a href="http://indigo.lib.uic.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/10027/99/8/Alexander.Trials.pdf">available here as trial
number
129</a>.</p>

<p>Rome in 81BC was under the dictatorship of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla">Sulla</a> after a
civil war. Sulla <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscription">proscribed</a>
perceived enemies of the state. According to Wikipedia, up to 9000
people (mainly nobles) were executed without trial as part of the
proscriptions and had their property seized. It was in this environment
of fear and extra-judicial killings that the trial takes place. So when
Cicero starts claiming that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Chrysogonus">Chrysogonus</a>,
the man in charge of the proscriptions, is the more likely murderer, I
can imagine the concern shown is real.</p>

<p>The process of the trial is somewhat similar to modern trials, but
definitely foreign (details on Roman litigation can be found
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_litigation#Formulary_system">here</a>).
Familiar components are present such as a judge, jury, witnesses and
lawyers representing both sides. There seems to be an emphasis on
justice as a desirable outcome in Cicero’s defence. However, there are
glaring differences to modern trials (at least in the western world).
Prosecutions are brought by individuals rather than the state, even for
murder. To prevent false accusations and spurious trials, if a
prosecutor loses then they are branded on the forehead with a K (for
kalumnia, meaning “false accuser”). The trials are held in the open in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Romanum">Forum</a>, and in the
program attracts a vocal crowd of onlookers. The process seems to rely
more on rhetoric than evidence. This is no CSI: Ancient Rome. Witnesses
are insulted if the lawyers disagree. Cicero even takes issue with
Chrysogonus’ “curled and perfumed” hair. There are no
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objection_(law)">objections</a> or
protests.</p>

<p>I can’t speak to the historical accuracy of the program, but couldn’t
find any errors after a few online searches. I was particularly glad to
see that the buildings shown had some colour on them rather than the
common and incorrect pure white (ancient Roman buildings are white now
because the paint has disappeared over time). As for the accuracy of the
trial itself, it depends how much you trust Cicero’s account.</p>

<p>Excellent, well worth a watch.</p>
