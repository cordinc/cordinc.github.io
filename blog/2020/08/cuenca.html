<p>In May 2019 I spent a week in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuenca,_Spain">Cuenca</a> just before it was time for me to leave Spain. This small city about half way between Madrid and Valencia, is only a hour from either of those cities on the comfortable high speed train. Despite the place crawling with Valenciano and Madrileno tourists over the weekend, it felt like a secret place. Perhaps because the whole place just seems to shutdown and is super quiet on Monday and to a lesser extent Sunday and Tuesday when the weekend tourists leave. Or maybe because it was the first place in Spain I visited where everyone else’s English was not better than my poor Spanish (although most people were at least as good).</p>

<p>Cuenca is a great place to spend a few days if you like living at a slower pace. The old city is pretty and there is plenty to look at with a few museums. The highlight for me was three walks that start in the old town and take you out into the surrounding countryside over the course of 5-10kms. It was pleasantly warm in May, although be prepared to walk up and downhill as there are a few steep hills (with the town itself built on the side of one of them).</p>

<p>Food in the town is at the extremes: many of the restaurants were uninspired tourist fare, but others were incredibly good. All were surprisingly cheap. The cuisine tends towards meat, don’t assume a dish has any vegetables except potato unless specifically mentioned. Two restaurants particularly impressed me, both with Michelin stars. <a href="https://www.raffsanpedro.es/?idioma=en">Raff</a> serves hardy fare with lots of game. Simple food, very well cooked, in large portions, with good service. It was hard to chose from short menu, it all looked good. <a href="http://restaurantetrivio.com/index_eng.html">Trivio</a> served fancier food. It has no menu in normal sense, patrons just choose to have a 6, 9, or 15 course tasting menu, supposedly changed every day depending on what is good in the local markets. I had 9 courses and all were excellent and different (I especially enjoyed the red mullet with mushroom). There was a good amount of food and it was still cheaper than most other Michelin starred restaurants in Europe (only Raff &amp; <a href="/blog/2008/05/fancy-restaurants.html">The Sportsman</a> have been cheaper places I’ve visited).</p>

<p>My best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/cuenca_19.html">available
here</a>.</p>
