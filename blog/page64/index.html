<p>Supporting the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> course <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a219.htm">of the
same name</a>,
and despite the title, this series of podcasts is focused entirely upon
classical poetry. There are 11 podcasts along with transcripts. The
shortest is 10 minutes and the longest 24 minutes. All the podcasts are
audio only and have a high level of production quality. Various
classical poems are recited in both the original Ancient Greek or Latin,
as well as translated English.</p>

<p>The series starts with a couple of lectures on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer’s</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">Odyssey</a>. This is followed by a
further two lectures on the issues in translating Homer and why the
translations can never be an exact match for the original. The series
then moves to Rome and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus">Catullus</a>, before finishing with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace">Horace</a> and the satires of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenal">Juvenal</a>. Most of the lectures
focus on the literary aspects of the works and not the historical
context. For instance, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_(poetry)">meter</a> of
classical poetry is quite different to modern English poetry. The
rhythmic pattern of classical poetry is based on the length of syllables
rather than the stress on syllables. Little time is given to the
historical context of the works. One exception is the lecture on
Catullus (which may need a little background knowledge on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">late
Roman Republic</a>). Some of
Catullus’ work insulted important people of the age (in particular
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher">Clodius</a>), and
this may not have been the wisest course of action - although he was
forgiven by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar</a> after
an apology.</p>

<p>Skippable, unless you have a particular interest in classical poetry.</p>

    <p>There is a story told around the <a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/">UWA Computer Science
department</a> I occasionally retell.
Supposedly, in the early 90’s someone at the national level discovered
that a huge percentage of all internet traffic into Australia was going
to UWA. After some investigation it was discovered that most of the
traffic was overnight and into the CS department. Even further
investigation demonstrated that the traffic was to a single desktop
computer owned by one of the grad students. It was then found that this
student was running a mirror of decoded images from the
alt.binaries.erotica.*
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup">newsgroups</a> with

or the <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978539">UC Berkeley
website</a></p>

<p>In between Professor Isabelle Pafford recording <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/12/history-4a-the-ancient-mediter.html">The Ancient
Mediterranean
World</a>
and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/01/history-110-roman-republic.html">History 110: Roman
Republic</a>,
she recorded a lecture series from <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>
in the Spring of 2008 on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman
Empire</a>. The series consists
of 48 audio-only lectures, with most between 30 and 45 minutes in length
(and around 10MB in size). The podcasts sometimes reference slides which
are unavailable online.</p>

<p>The podcasts detail the Roman Empire from its origins in the civil wars
of the 1st century BC to the fall of the Western Roman Empire nearly 500
years later. There is a long introduction on the events leading up to
the republic’s fall and the creation of an empire. The first half dozen
lectures are essentially a recap of the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman
Republic</a> podcasts,
starting with the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla">Sulla</a>
and running through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Julius
Caesar</a> to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Octavian</a>. Pafford points out
that the empire only looks like destiny in retrospect, and at the time
people were very unsure of the future. By comparison the end of the
empire passes very quickly. The last hundred years of decline in the
west after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_the_Apostate">Julian the
Apostate</a> through the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome">sack of Rome in 410AD</a> to
the last emperor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus">Romulus
Augustulus</a> are covered
in a single lecture. Little mention is made of the east’s transformation
into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine
Empire</a>. Along the way we
learn about the convoluted family history of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty">Julio-Claudian
dynasty</a>, the
stabilising influence of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine_dynasty">5 good
emperors</a>,
the near collapse of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century">3rd century
crisis</a>, and
the conversion to Christianity under
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I">Constantine</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot of history covered during the nearly 27 hours of this
series, so I will not go through all the content. The lectures are
largely in chronological order and detail history from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source">primary
sources</a> of the time. Thus
they focus mainly on the emperors and palace history and there are many
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_emperors">Roman emperors</a>
(especially during the 3rd century crisis). There is also an interesting
and constant discussion on the reliability of primary sources. How bad
were emperors like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligua</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius">Tiberius</a> really? The sources
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius">Suetonius</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus">Tacitus</a>) describe some
incredible events, but at the same time the sources were known to be
hostile to them. Presumably the sources couldn’t believably say too many
bad things about the more popular emperors like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus/">Augustus</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius">Claudius</a>, but could safely
exaggerate with the less well liked. As Proffessor Pafford says, the
truth behind Tiberius’ time on Capri with crowds of young children may
not be as lascivious as the sources imply, but she certainly wouldn’t
send her kids to spend summer with Uncle Tiberius!</p>

<p>Interspersed within the chronological series of podcasts are the
occasional side lecture. These include: the Roman city;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome">slavery</a>; the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Ancient_Rome">role of women in Roman
society</a>; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman
religion</a>. There
is also a lecture on Roman art which unfortunately involves cases
studies on artifacts shown to the original class, but unseen by the
audio-only podcast listener. Despite this, these side lectures are among
the best of the podcasts as they give an insight into general life in
the Roman Empire and a break from the constant palace intrigue in the
main lectures.</p>

<p>As with previous podcasts, the production quality of this series is not
the best. However, for most lectures it is at an adequate level. The
podcasts are recordings of actual university lectures, so there is some
class discussion at the start of most lectures. One lecture starts with
10 minutes of talking about an assignment, including the class cajoling
Professor Pafford to give them an extension on their assignment (which
they got). There are no missing lectures. Apparently one wasn’t recorded
so Professor Pafford rerecorded it (thank you!). The first few lectures
are recorded at a low level and are hard to hear, but after that they
get much better apart from a buzz in a couple of them.</p>

<p>Professor Pafford is an entertaining lecturer and the course is full of
interesting detail. Most of the lectures have acceptable production
values. One of the better podcast series available.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java">Java 5 added generics</a>
into the language. This allowed programmers to specify class types as
parameters to other classes and maintain type safety. For instance
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Set&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is a set of integers and if you try to add a
non-integer to it, a compile time error should occur.</p>

<p>Java had been around a while by the time generics were added.
Unfortunately it was considered too hard to add generics to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java
bytecode</a> that forms a
running Java program. Instead generics are just syntactic sugar. When a
Java program is compiled the generics are checked, but after that they
are stripped out. The bytecode that is run does not know anything about
generics. This means it is possible to violate the generics constraints
in the code at run-time (because the constraints don’t exist at
run-time).</p>

<p>Below is an example demonstrating the problem. A set of integers is
created, but then using reflection a string is added to the set. This is
clearly a violation of the set’s definition. However,
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/Reflection/">reflection</a>
is a run-time process and the compiler is not smart enough to detect the
potential error at compile-time (which would be very hard to do). If the
set is now inspected (and not checked carefully), it will look like the
integer 1 is in the set, rather than the actual string “1”. At this
point various errors can occur, from the subtle <code class="highlighter-rouge">contains</code> error below,
to outright
<a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/ClassCastException.html's">ClassCastException</a>
if elements are extracted from the set as integers. As an aside,
reflection is very cool and a great tool, but from my experience, most
of the time it is the wrong tool.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nc">Set</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">integerSet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">HashSet</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>
<span class="nc">Method</span> <span class="n">addMethod</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">integerSet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getClass</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">getMethod</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"add"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">Object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">addMethod</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">invoke</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">integerSet</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"1"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">integerSet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">contains</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// -&gt; false</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Remember, Java generics are not real generics. In particular pay special
attention to using reflection on generic objects.</p>

    <p>In previous tutorials we created a <a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/4_animating/index.html">walking mech model in
Blender</a>.
Astute readers may remember I said the aim was to create a model that
could be used in a simple game. Now that the model is complete, it is
time to use it in a simple 3D program. The aim is to write a program
where the mech is controlled by the player and can walk around the
screen using its walkcycle animation. Writing everything from scratch is
not realistic in any reasonable time frame. Thus the
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre3D</a> library is used to help with the
graphics. I chose Ogre3D because it is free, seems well regarded, is
actively developed and, has exporters for Blender models. Below is an
image of the resulting program. Read on for the steps in its creation.</p>
