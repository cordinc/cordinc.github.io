    <p>In previous tutorials we created a <a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/4_animating/index.html">walking mech model in
Blender</a>.
Astute readers may remember I said the aim was to create a model that
could be used in a simple game. Now that the model is complete, it is
time to use it in a simple 3D program. The aim is to write a program
where the mech is controlled by the player and can walk around the
screen using its walkcycle animation. Writing everything from scratch is
not realistic in any reasonable time frame. Thus the
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre3D</a> library is used to help with the
graphics. I chose Ogre3D because it is free, seems well regarded, is
actively developed and, has exporters for Blender models. Below is an
image of the resulting program. Read on for the steps in its creation.</p>

methodology</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> has a huge number of short
podcasts available and many are related to ancient history. Roman
Funerary Monuments is part of their course on the classical world. The
title accurately describes the content. There are 7 video podcasts in
this series with a combined running time of roughly half an hour. All
the videos are available in either iPod or a larger (640x360) format,
with PDF transcripts. The visuals entirely consist of Roman funerary
monuments in their modern state with documentary style narration. The
necropolis at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isola_Sacra_Necropolis">Isola
Sacra</a> features
heavily.</p>

<p>Rather than focus on the monuments themselves, these podcasts use them
to provide an insight into Roman culture. As the most common form of
remnant surviving from Roman times, funerary monuments are a useful
primary source. Epitaphs provide names (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">Roman
names</a> were very
informative), ages, family relations and sometimes a short biography.
Thus the dead could create a lasting image of themselves, emphasising
the positive aspects of their life (in a Roman context) and omitting the
negative. Freed slaves tended to take particular advantage of this, with
their tombs being more extravagant than others of similar wealth.
Funeral monuments also suggest that family relationships were important
(especially among freed slaves, perhaps because as such relationships
would have been limited under servitude). Roman law prohibited funeral
monuments inside cities, so they were built alongside the roads leading
out of the towns. Spots directly alongside the road being the prime
location. Tombs also sought to catch the eye, and were designed to be
visited. They often contained items to promote a longer stay such as
art, furnishings, and in one case, a well.</p>

<p>This series is well worth a viewing.</p>

  <h4><a href="/blog/2010/08/rules-of-programming.html">Rules of Programming</a></h4> 
  Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/General.html">General</a>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Coder, programmer, software developer, IT engineer. Whatever it is
called, my profession has changed the way I think. I started learning to
program 23 years ago as a hobby, started studying it seriously 17 years
ago and have been doing it as a job for 13 years. Now I seem to think a
great deal straighter than I did before - straighter than when I was in
my early twenties and studying postgrad logic. By thinking straight, I
mean following a chain of logical rules to their conclusion -
determining what they imply and where any gaps in the rules or strange
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case">corner cases</a> exist.
Straighter in that I can quickly work out the logical chain, identify
problems, and ignore unimportant avenues of thought. I don’t tend to
take the scenic route anymore; I go straight to the destination.</p>

<p>This makes sense to me, most of my job as a programmer is thinking
straight. Writing the code is very easy once the language is mastered.
Instead, the job comes down to solving problems with code. At the start
of a project this is done by precisely specifying the steps of the
solution in code. No ambiguity is allowed and all the possible
situations must be covered. Edge and corner cases will cause bugs, so
must be considered. As the project progresses, any changes or additions
must take into account interactions with the body of rules already
encoded in the existing codebase. As the complexity of the system
increases, so do the possible interactions and it gets harder to run
through them. This is one of the reasons big systems tend to have so
many problems and why experienced coders try to keep things as simple as
they can.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable that I have trained myself this way. I have far more
than the suggested
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)"></a>10,000
hours&lt;/a&gt; of practice. A back of the envelope calculation suggests I’m
close to 50,000 hours. That much practice is bound to etch a groove in
my thought process. Sometimes that groove is too easy to follow and I
get lost in thought, monomaniacally thinking about a system. In software
development this state is often sought out and is no bad thing, except
in your interactions with other people. Sometimes I wonder if a similar
process is at work in other professions, perhaps with less than ethical
results.</p>

<p>I studied a Business degree mid career (so far). It hasn’t been of huge
career advantage to me, as I have learnt I am happiest just coding away.
However, I did learn the basics of some other professions. There was a
semester of accounting and another of contract law. In both courses the
lecturers spent some time detailing how case law or accounting rules
were applied - explaining that it wasn’t intuitive and you just had to
follow the general rules. What!? I found it quite simple to apply the
rules and I achieved good marks with little effort. I just did the same
thing I did every day, simply swapping lines of code for case law.</p>

<p>My impression is that both law and accounting use similar thought
processes to programming - applying rules to reach a desired end state.
While programming uses exact statements of software logic; law and
accounting use the written language in laws, cases or standards. This
natural language is more malleable and open to interpretation. I
sometimes wonder if people in other professions get similarly lost in
their rules. Focussing on just beating the problem as presented to the
exclusion of other concerns. This could offer a generous excuse for the
motivation behind results like tax evasion, or dodgy financial products.</p>

    <p>I was looking to learn how to write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_I/O">non-blocking

couldn’t find one that suited my needs online. I found
<a href="http://javanioserver.sourceforge.net/doc/index.html">this</a> example, but
it didn’t handle my situation. There is also <a href="http://mina.apache.org/">Apache
MINA</a>, but it was a little complex for my
simple needs. So armed with these examples and a couple of tutorials
(<a href="http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/tutorials/j-nio/resources.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.java2s.com/Code/Java/Network-Protocol/Nonblockserver.htm">here</a>),

Podcasts</a></p>

<p>Another of the numerous <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a>
podcasts, this series of videos gives an overview of the town of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paestum">Paestum</a>, located in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campania">Campania</a>. The town was
originally called Poseidonia when founded by Greek colonists in the 7th
century BC. There are 4 videos totalling just over 20 minutes in length.
They are available in iPod or a larger (640x360) format. There are also
transcripts. The visuals are of the modern ruins or of artefacts
recovered from the town.</p>

<p>Modern day Paestum is dominated by three big temples built by the Greek
founders. The first video spends some time on these temples and the time
in which they were built. Unfortunately, the site was excavated in haste
in the last century and damaged in the process. Despite this there is
evidence of variations from established Greek culture. There are 24
flutes on the temples’ columns rather than the traditional 20. The
second video shows paintings from an archaic Greek tomb. In the 5th
century BC Poseidonia was conquered by a nearby tribe - the Lucanians.
The third video focuses on some funeral paintings from this period.
Despite the Lucanians’ reputation as barbarians, there is little
physical evidence of disruption from this period in the city, and they
must have been largely Hellenised. There was a large discontinuity to
the city when it became Roman in 273BC and renamed Paestum. Much of the
city was rebuilt in the Roman style although the temples remained
intact. The fourth video deals with this period.</p>

<p>An interesting, but very short and narrowly focused, series.</p>
