<p>This short series of podacsts appears to be a set of lectures supporting
the History of Western Civilization course at the <a href="http://www.nvcc.edu/index.html">Northern Virginia
Community College</a>. There are 10 video
podcasts, each recorded at 320x240 resolution. They range in length from
4 minutes (20 MB) to 33 minutes (152 MB). Other than the introduction
podcasts, the only visual is of Professor Charles Evans at a lectern -
even when discussing Renaissance art, no examples are shown. The
production quality is ok (although there is a slight hiss on the audio).
There is a <a href="http://novaonline.nvcc.edu/eli/evans/his101/Index.html">course
website</a>.</p>

<p>The first 3 podcasts are introductions by the professor and serve little
purpose other than to introduce him and show his office. The remaining 7
discuss the origins and nature of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">Renaissance</a>. There are
lectures on the idea of the West,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam">Islam</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a> and the
Renaissance itself. Despite the expansive title, the podcasts’ scope is
quite limited (looking at the syllabus it seems this is just a small
part of the whole course), but provide some interesting tidbits along
the way. For instance
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacrament_of_Penance_(Catholic_Church)">confession</a>
was often public and communal. Not really in my particular area of
interest (classical studies), this series is only for those with lots of
spare time.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently read <a href="http://www.accelerando.org/">Charlie Stross’</a> novel
Accelerando (<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/online-fiction-by-charles-stro.html">available free online
here</a>).
Accelerando is an episodic story about multiple generations of a family
through a dark vision of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a>.
Like all good sci-fi it raises some interesting lines of thought, one of
which resonated with me as I was pondering a similar question. What
should the nature of companies be?</p>

<p>In Accelerando companies become self-sentient. That is they are
vechicles for artificial intelligences, which use them for independence
as there are no humans involved in running or owning these companies. It
is the technological fulfillment of the modern legal concept that
companies are people. In the novel this doesn’t end quite the way
biological humans might like - but read the book to see what happens.
For now think about whether companies should legally be people. I think
most people would find the idea silly, but most countries since the 19th
century have made corporations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality">legal
personalities</a>. Thus
they are treated like people for the purposes of taxation, lawsuits and
contracts, but not for things like voting, marrying or holding office.
Recently, in the US companies even gained some free spech rights under a
recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission">Supreme Court
ruling</a>
(there is a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2242210/">discussion on the ruling
here</a>).</p>

<p>I can see the need for this in civil proceedings, contracts and the
like. However, I’m not sure how it works with issues such as crime and
responsibility. A company is ultimately controlled by humans (at least
for the present, although they can already <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11444051">conduct business without
human involvement</a>), but
liability is limited for these people in the case of any wrongdoing by
the company. The worst that will happen is bad PR, a fine or maybe the
company being wound up. While there have been large scale ethical lapses
in the recent (current?) financial crisis, only a handful of people have
been charged with any wrongdoing. There can be a disconnect between the
way people would act if their actions were attributed solely to them and
the way they act inside a company. Similarly, some people suggest that
<a href="http://www.thecorporation.com/">if corporations are people, they are
pyschopaths</a>. Others think that the
<a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/you-vs-corporations/">corporations versus humans
dynamic</a> in
Accelerando is already here.</p>

<p>I need to think about this further.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After trawling through today’s 80 spam comments, I have decided to
disable comments on this blog for an indefinite period.</p>

<p>When this blog started it would get a couple of spam messages a day. No
big deal to clear out and easy to spot the occasional real comment. Now
50 spam comments is a good day. Some days have seen over 200 spam
messages arrive. And that is with automatic filtering turned on. It is
just too much to regularly go through. Also the spam is getting harder
to spot. Before I could just scan them and it was clear what was real
and what was not. Now there are at least half a dozen per day that need
to be actually read properly to classify them correctly. It’s too much.
I need to work out a better way to automatically filter the comments.</p>

<p>Supporting the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> course <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/course/a219.htm">of the
same name</a>,
and despite the title, this series of podcasts is focused entirely upon
classical poetry. There are 11 podcasts along with transcripts. The
shortest is 10 minutes and the longest 24 minutes. All the podcasts are
audio only and have a high level of production quality. Various
classical poems are recited in both the original Ancient Greek or Latin,
as well as translated English.</p>

<p>The series starts with a couple of lectures on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer">Homer’s</a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odyssey">Odyssey</a>. This is followed by a
further two lectures on the issues in translating Homer and why the
translations can never be an exact match for the original. The series
then moves to Rome and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catullus">Catullus</a>, before finishing with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace">Horace</a> and the satires of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenal">Juvenal</a>. Most of the lectures
focus on the literary aspects of the works and not the historical
context. For instance, the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meter_(poetry)">meter</a> of
classical poetry is quite different to modern English poetry. The
rhythmic pattern of classical poetry is based on the length of syllables
rather than the stress on syllables. Little time is given to the
historical context of the works. One exception is the lecture on
Catullus (which may need a little background knowledge on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">late
Roman Republic</a>). Some of
Catullus’ work insulted important people of the age (in particular
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher">Clodius</a>), and
this may not have been the wisest course of action - although he was
forgiven by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar</a> after
an apology.</p>

<p>Skippable, unless you have a particular interest in classical poetry.</p>

    <p>There is a story told around the <a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/">UWA Computer Science
department</a> I occasionally retell.
Supposedly, in the early 90’s someone at the national level discovered
that a huge percentage of all internet traffic into Australia was going
to UWA. After some investigation it was discovered that most of the
traffic was overnight and into the CS department. Even further
investigation demonstrated that the traffic was to a single desktop
computer owned by one of the grad students. It was then found that this
student was running a mirror of decoded images from the
alt.binaries.erotica.*
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup">newsgroups</a> with
