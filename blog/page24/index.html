    <p>After telling the below story to a couple of people, they thought it
should be shared more widely.</p>

<p>Scene: I call my UK business bank over an issue I’m having with a bank
transfer. After waiting on hold for several minutes, I reach a Customer
Service Representative and verify my identity. They ask why I’m calling.</p>

<p>Me: Hi, I can’t transfer money to an account at another bank.</p>

<p>Customer Service Rep (CSR): Sorry to hear that, let me check your
account… Hmmm, yes, there appears to be a block on your account. It
seems we had some returned mail so as a fraud precaution a transaction
and mail block was placed on your account in December. Someone tried to
call at the time, but was unable to contact you. I can remove the block.</p>

<p>Me: Hang on, December? I have received mail since then, I have a letter
from from you in my hand right now.</p>

<p>CSR: When is it dated?</p>

<p>Me: February, it is the February account statement.</p>

<p>CSR: Oh, that’s strange, let me check… Ah, yes. The fraud prevention
block is on the credit card card account. Your current account does not
have a block.</p>

<p>Me: So to because some mail was returned you stopped my credit card
mail, but my current account mail was still sent and all arrived fine.
That doesn’t seem right.</p>

<p>CSR: They are on different systems. The block only applies to one.</p>

<p>Me: So one system thought there was a fraud issue, while the other
thought it was all fine and kept sending mail?</p>

<p>CSR: Yes.</p>

<p>Me: Ok… I don’t really need the mail anyway, can you send less?</p>

<p>CSR: Yes, we can put you on our paperless plan, then you will only
received credit card statements and any current account statement that
includes a fee we have charged.</p>

<p>Me: But you charge me a fee every month.</p>

<p>CSR: Um, yes, that’s right.</p>

<p>Me: So you will send exactly the same amount of mail on the paperless
system as you do now.</p>

<p>CSR: Yes.</p>

<p>Me: Ok, don’t bother then, just please remove the block. My mail arrives
fine.</p>

<p>CSR: That is done, anything else I can help you with.</p>

<p>Me: No, bye.</p>

<p>I may have been a little abrupt there at the end. My apologies to the
customer service rep who was stuck in a bad situation. However, this is
just silliness from one of my banks and sadly not recently out of
character. I am becoming increasingly irritated by their strange
requirements, poor customer service, and outright refusal to do many
tasks other banks perform without issue. They also advertise themselves
as an international bank, but this appears to manifest itself largely in
their marketing copy. I certainly have trouble discerning much
international service. Four years ago I recommended this bank to another
person. This year I suggested another person completely avoid them. I
hope to soon take my own advice.</p>

<p>Also, I screen my calls, so that person may have called in December but
definitely did not leave a message - I check them all.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Here is the second and final posting on gaming podcasts - this one
looking at game design podcasts.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://thegamedesignroundtable.com">Game Design Roundtable</a></em> is
hosted by a few working game designers including Rob Daviau (one of the
two people behind the excellent board game <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/161936/pandemic-legacy-season-1">Pandemic
Legacy</a>).
There is no set structure. Sometimes the hosts just have a chat catching
up on what they are working on. Sometimes they interview another game
designer from various parts of the gaming industry (boardgames, card
games or computer games). Although my favourites are the “Listener
Mailbag” episodes - a whole 40-60 minutes of the hosts answering
listener questions, from quite specific game design problems to business
issues. This is a really good series and I learn something new with each
episode. It also should make indie computer gamedevs thankful for not
being in the board game industry - the success of Pandemic Legacy aside,
it seems like a much tougher way to make a living.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.designer-notes.com">Designer Notes</a></em> is a series of
interviews presented by Soren Johnson, the lead designer of Civilization
IV (although he does not actually conduct all the interviews). Each
month an experienced game designer (usually from the computer game
industry) is questioned at length about how they got into game design
and the course of their career. While the names of the designers may not
be well-known, the games they have worked on certainly are! I have
listened to about half the series and heard from the designers of World
of Warcraft, Crusader Kings 2, Triple Town and Planescape. The episodes
tend to be quite long, some going past the 2 hour mark. There is
definitely a great deal of game design talent present, but unfortunately
little in the way of usable information for the aspiring designer.
Instead the questions focus more on personality, personal history, how
careers in the industry progress (or meander, as it appears), and the
stories of how certain games were made. Still very interesting
(depending on the interviewee), although I tend to listen only when
doing something else at the same time.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://slangdesign.com/rppr/category/game-designer-workshop/">RPPR Game Designers
Workshop</a></em>
is a sub-series within the RPPR podcast. RPPR does tabletop RPG news and
recorded play sessions (pretty good), but mixed in with the rest of
their episodes is this irregular series. Two of the members of the usual
team are designing their own RPG’s and these podcasts detail their
travails as they go (or “failing in realtime, so you don’t have to” as
they say). The series has been going for a while (10 episodes over 2.5
years) and demonstrates certain invariants of game design - prototyping,
play-testing, iteration. It also makes me glad I’m not an tabletop RPG
designer (computer game devs have it easy)! The presenters are
entertaining and the content illuminating. Worth a listen.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.kenandrobintalkaboutstuff.com">Ken &amp; Robin Talk About
Stuff</a></em> is Ken Hite &amp; Robin
Laws talking on various topics. They are both tabletop RPG designers
with many successful games behind them. Both are excellent and
entertaining speakers regardless of the subject matter. Unsurprisingly
the podcast tends towards tabletop RPGs (how to play, game suggestions,
etc), but I’ve also heard them cover (each multiple times) history,
films, maps, politics, occult figures, even cooking. There is little
directly applicable to computer game design, but the density of ideas is
incredible. I’ve listened to over 100 episodes and always have an idea
for a cool game afterwards. A great podcast to fire the imagination.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I have regularly produced posts on <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/tag/Podcasts.html">history
podcasts</a> for this blog.
However, the vast majority of my podcast consumption is not focussed on
history. Instead my iPod is full of music and gaming podcasts. I won’t
review the music podcasts, but I do write about
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/tag/Games.html">gaming</a> occasionally, so I
thought it may be worth giving my brief thoughts on gaming podcasts.
Here is part 1: my opinion on 4 gaming podcasts. While the next part
will detail 4 game design podcasts.</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/3ma/">Three Moves Ahead</a></em> is a long
running podcast focusing predominately on strategy and tactical games. I
am a huge fan of such games, and this is my favourite source for
deciding whether a game might be something I should consider buying.
Episodes are a well produced freeform discussion between a group of game
journalists (often hosted by Rob Zacny). Most episodes are an incredibly
detailed deep dive into the gameplay and mechanics of a single computer
game (or occasionally, a board game). So detailed is the examination
that I considered also including this podcast in the game design post.
The games chosen are also not always the big current releases, they also
look at old classics, and once a month a title chosen by their listeners
(by vote). Excellent podcast and a must-listen for anyone remotely
interested in strategy/tactical games (as a player or creator).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://5by5.tv/dlc">DLC</a></em> is the latest gaming show from Jeff
Cannata, previously from the discontinued
<a href="http://revision3.com/trs">TRS</a> and NLB (what is with the 3 letter
acronyms?). Here he joins comedian Christian Spicer and a weekly guest
(journalist, developer or sometimes just a friend) in a structured
discussion on current gaming news. Each episode follows a familiar
progression: first is News of the Week, where the latest game news is
discussed; then Playlist, talking about the games the participants
played this week; and finally Tabletop Time, looking at board games
(although this last section often feels like an afterthought, becoming a
Jeff Cannata monologue). I find this podcast the best source of gaming
news (despite it being up a week old) as the subsequent discussion is
usually quite enlightening and contains reasonable (unlike Internet
commenters!) and differing points of view. This show is also the most
professional podcast in this list and it shows - it is a high quality
production and both presenters are good speakers (no talking over each
other here), but it also contains a couple of minutes of advertising
(not much of a problem in a 90 minute show). While the News section is a
weekly must-listen, and the Playlist an interesting discussion of
current games, I usually find myself skipping Tabletop time.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://crateandcrowbar.com">Crate &amp; Crowbar</a></em> is a revolving group UK
game journalists having a chat about what they are playing while
drinking (alcohol), and sometimes a bit of bit news &amp; listener
questions. This is the only podcast where all the participants are
actually physically together in person, and can sometimes feel like
eavesdropping on a friendly work chat between knowledgeable gamers, with
a side competition in who can provide the most humorous quip. It tends
to require some knowledge of current games, and listeners should expect
some serious and often intellectual discussion on the nature of game
design and the role of games in culture (I never heard a gaming podcast
mention <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=ludonarrative+dissonance">Ludonarrative
dissonance</a>
in their reviews before). There are also often entertaining stories on
notable moments in games (cool, or disappointing). They generally play
what ever is new that week in any genre, and if its something that
doesn’t interest me I’ll just fast forward a bit. They also answer
listener questions at the end and this can be a real highlight (who asks
these questions? other intellectual game journalists?).</p>

<p><em><a href="https://www.spacegamejunkie.com/category/podcasts/">SpaceGameJunkie</a></em>
has only been on my listening list for a few weeks, but it is sounding
good so far. This podcasts differs from the other as it is the only one
made by fans rather than industry insiders (as far as I can tell).
Sometime this results in questionable production quality, but also with
what appears to be real interest for the games being discussed. As the
title suggests this podcasts focussed exclusively on space games
(although there seems to be a wide definition of that genre). The format
is a discussion about a single game between two gaming fans and one or
two people from the development team. There is usually an accompanying
YouTube video of the game being played. The chat is always friendly, but
unfortunately the devs often sound like PR people. The games covered are
often small and not well known. Sometimes they are in an early stage of
development and the podcast becomes a design session. The strong
impression is it is just a few people who want to talk about their games
and help promote them. A laudable goal and the result is worth a listen.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>It has been a couple of months since releasing <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/374150/">Concealed Intent onto
Steam Early Access</a> it is
time to assess how things have gone and plan for the future.</p>

<p>While I’m quite happy with Concealed Intent as a game, financially it
has been a disappointment. Largely this is my own fault. As a sole
developer I must make a choice between developing or marketing. I have
overwhelming chosen dev work over the last 2 months. Still the sales
have still resulted in a few people playing it and providing feedback.
It has highlighted a some bugs and issues, most of which are now fixed.
Early Access has also given me a focus - single player skirmishes seem
to be more highly desired than online play (lucky because there are not
enough players to form a decent online community right now). This is
immensely useful information. Previously the game was trying to be a bit
of everything in the hope of attracting the attention of a potential
purchaser. Now it will be mainly single-player, where skirmish is the
main game, but there is a also basic online play so you can challenge
your friends.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/assets/posts/new_skirmish.png"><img src="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/assets/posts/new_skirmish_thumb.png" alt="Concealed Intent Skirmish" /></a></p>

<p>Under this vision, the way forward to release is clear. Procedural
skirmish must be expanded with an AI that can provide some challenge.
The single-player campaign can be shortened but needs to more engaging
while subtlety teaching the game. Online play is largely done, only bug
fixes and performance enhancements remain.</p>

<p>So that is the plan to finish Concealed Intent. Skirmish improvements,
then AI improvements, then mission work, then… done? At least in the
sense of a proper “release”, yes it will be done. The majority of my
time after that point will be spent on developing other games. There
will still be a few things to do Linux support, non-Steam online
support, other little improvements and of course bug fixes as required.</p>

<p>Right now I’ve nearly finished a first pass at the Skirmish
improvements. If it was not for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org">GGJ16</a> I’d
release it this weekend. Instead it will be available early next week
(so I’m around if there is a problem). I hope to have a final version
with improved AI by mid-Feb. Then I foresee a couple more fortnightly
versions iterating on the campaign and improving skirmish &amp; AI as
issues/ideas arise. However, that will not be the end. As previously
stated, I have to choose between development and marketing. Since I have
a couple of months of dev work, I will continue mainly with that for
now. However, when the above task list is complete it will be time to
switch. Thus the plan is to finish the dev work, wait at least a week to
ensure there are no bad bugs, then start a 30 day release countdown
where I spend a few hours per day solely on marketing. Then the release,
followed by another week of marketing. Then just see.</p>

<p>One thing I don’t expect to see is a flood of sales. I hope to have
enough sales to cover my costs and provide enough money for a future
game. The feedback received so far is generally positive, but not “indie
breakout hit” positive. I will likely struggle for media coverage and
sales amongst a horde of other indie games. One advantage I have is that
my situation is unchanged, there is not much I could be doing other than
creating games. I have another 15 months before reality returns. Thus I
can create another game with my hard-won lessons from Concealed Intent.
In fact since the main lesson learnt is to make much smaller games,
hopefully I can make more than one. Ideal would be a couple of short (3
month dev work) games made with an artist willing to profit-share (to
keep upfront costs down). I have collected a few such small ideas and it
is time to start creating prototypes to check if they are worth
pursuing. By mid-Feb I hope to be spending about 10-20% of my time on
this task - a pipeline of work must be established to take over from
Concealed Intent as it requires less time (not counting marketing of
course!). Otherwise there will be no chance of continuing gamedev as a
profession long-term.</p>

<p>The other main lesson is that marketing is hard. Very hard. There are a
large number of people out to get keys for “reviews”, but very few can
deliver and those asking are almost always the smaller media outlets.
The larger ones are probably swamped with review requests. Getting
noticed is difficult. During the release-30 countdown I’ll do my best to
let people know Concealed Intent exists. Although I’ve also been
considering trying to become the media. Sure, I have a couple of rarely
viewed blogs (like this one), but viewing some the of key requesters’
outlets made me wonder if I could try that too. Basically an attempt to
build a community around games in general, not specifically my games.
Maybe it will happen, maybe it won’t (check back here to find out!). I
have a few ideas on how to make things a little different to others, now
I just need to check the time requirements. There will probably be one
video just to experiment.</p>

<p>Hmm, still so much to do and so many possibilities. But first to GGJ16…</p>
