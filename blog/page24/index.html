    <p>Work, work, work. Over the last few months, I have been working hard to
complete Concealed Intent to a saleable standard. It is already the
longest (2.5 years), largest (&gt;30K LOC) project I’ve ever undertaken,
and getting better all the time. It is even <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">available for download
here</a>
at the moment (warning: in a alpha testing state). That link will
continue to host the current version until the game goes on sale as part
of Steam Early Access.</p>

<p>How long until Early Access? I’ve tried to <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2015/07/18/The-Best-Laid-Plans/">derive a plan over at my
work
blog</a>.
Early September is my target. The final run in is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>31st July</strong> - v0.9.11: Rework some parts of GUI, like the stats
panel and loadout screens.</li>
  <li><strong>14th August</strong> - v0.9.12: 1v1 online play and supporting screens.</li>
  <li><strong>28th August</strong> - v0.9.13: Steam integration, 3 extra missions and
some AI rework.</li>
  <li><strong>?? September</strong> - Profit! (or at least, Steam Early Access!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">take a look at the alpha
version</a>
if you can, and please leave feedback too (click ‘J’ at anytime in the
game).</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Finally success! For quite some time I have been trying to find a
computer game that my girlfriend will like. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/06/too-many-game-reviews.html">To The
Moon</a>
and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2015/06/the-walking-dead.html">The Walking Dead Season
1</a> only held
her attention for a matter of minutes. She completed <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/01/game-reviews.html">Thomas Was
Alone</a>, but
claimed not to enjoy the experience. Easy to believe considering her
tense shoulders and sweating while playing. But now there is a game that
she both finished and displayed happy entertainment during the game. The
next day I was even asked if there was another episode or sequel to play
next! What was the title that reached such lofty heights? <a href="http://www.herstorygame.com">Her
Story</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/her_story.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Her Story is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_motion_video">Full Motion
Video</a> detective game.
The basic idea is that the player is investigating a 20 year old murder
by going back through seven police interview tapes. Each tape is cut up
into short clips (of a few seconds through to a maximum couple of
minutes) recording the response to a question that is never shown. The
brilliant idea of the game is that the player can not just hit play and
start watching the videos from the start, nor can they just jump to the
end. Instead they can only interact with the game through a search box.
Type in a word (or phrase) and if it appears in one of the clips then
that clip will returned. Maybe. Only the first 5 clips in chronological
order are viewable, although you can see the number of matches. So our
first search, on the name of the person murdered, returned 61 clips, but
we could only watch the first 5. To get the rest we had to refine our
search or come at them from a different keyword (and direction). This is
immensely clever, I wish I thought of it first! The user interface is
simple, and intuitive to anyone who has used Google Search before (which
is everyone, right?). At the same time there is still a challenge as
most of the juicy stuff is in the later interviews.</p>

<p>It hard to say much more about the game as it is easily spoiled. Be
assured that the story is good no matter what angle you eventually come
at it. We certainly paid a great deal of attention to the dialogue,
trying to glean every ounce of information. As we discovered more, we
had to reconsider what was said earlier, as many of the clips can be
interpreted in multiple ways (the benefit of not hearing the question).
There are a few twists and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">red
herrings</a> (I think). As time
progressed we methodically worked our way through the clips following
particular lines of investigation - until there it was, the solution!
For us it took just under 2 hours (including a little bit of time after
knowing what had happened to discover why it had happened). In the end
we saw around 60% of the available clips. Looking online suggests most
people take closer to 3 hours. I think we were a little lucky to finish
that quickly - we were investigating a particular situation and the
search term returned the final clip (as well as another with the info we
actually intended). That that is the only concern I have with the game.
It is possible that a player could see the crucial clips almost straight
away, if they hit upon the right search terms. However, that is probably
unlikely as the obvious search terms are included in many clips, so the
most illuminating clips are not viewable until more refined search terms
are known. I can’t be sure, but I strongly suspect that the interview
text is minutely planned to avoid early spoiling - it certainly seemed
that way.</p>

<p>This is a clever game with a great story - definitely worth playing.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>About 2 hours before completing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(video_game)">The
Walking Dead</a> my opinion of the game changed, again, for the second
time. At first I liked it, then I found it disappointing, but by the end
I had grown an appreciation for the game. It is very enjoyable and has
probably the best story in any game I’ve played. Overall, I say it is
definitely in my top 10 games (since restarting gaming in 2011), but not
the top 5. Still a very good game.</p>

<p>The Walking Dead is a <a href="https://www.telltalegames.com">Telltale</a> game
based on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(comic_book)">comic
book of the same name</a> (which now also has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)">TV
series</a> based on it too). For those not familiar with Telltale’s
distinctive style, it is a story game where the player is given a choice
of various dialogue or action options. The game then promises that other
characters will remember those responses and act appropriately (a little
message often pops up like “Kenny will remember you supported him”).
These interactions are interspersed with point &amp; click puzzle scenes and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_time_event">quick time events</a>. The
games are told in an episodic manner, each episode rising to a crescendo
and often a cliffhanger for the next. The first episode of a game is
often available for free download if you just want to see what its like - <a href="https://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead/season1/">The Walking Dead episode 1 download is
here</a>. Telltale
games’ art style is usually comic book like (so this one fits in great
with the source material).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/The-walking-dead-season-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>At first I was amazed. I was making these decisions and they were
affecting the story! Imagine the number of possibilities. Then by the
second episode I realised that I wasn’t really changing anything. The
game may tell me that people would remember, but it didn’t seem to make
any significant difference. This is understandable. It would be a
programming and artwork nightmare to allow a significantly branching
story. Instead the game branches out for no more than a few minutes and
then returns regularly to known narrative chokepoints. The main story
beats (about one every 30 minutes of gameplay) are fixed. Furthermore,
these moments are binary, the same two possible choices are always
presented regardless of previous actions. When it became clear to me how
the game was working under the hood I was greatly disappointed - it is
not what I thought was promised. It is definitely not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">choose your own
adventure</a>.
This combined with the point &amp; click sections of the game being either
very easy or devolving into annoying repetitive “hunt the pixel” puzzles
and the always irritating quick time events (some of which are designed
to be failed) started to put me off. However, the story was good, and
its not too long (each episode being around 2.5 hours) so I thought I’d
keep going.</p>

<p>I’m very glad I did finish it. After a few more episodes (including the
obligatory and cliched cannibal encounter) I began to see the point of
the game. It is not supposed to be a complex and branching story at all.
That conceit exists just to get the player involved and connected to the
characters. The real game is all about those binary story beats. They
are actually moral conundrums. The rest of the game and its faux
decisions are just trying to make the player care enough to consider
them properly and weigh the possible outcomes. They are decisions like
who gets food, or how much effort you make to save someone’s life in the
face of personal danger. Big questions, often with no good outcomes,
just equally bad, but slight different consequences. Such questions are
easily dismissed within most games. People die in games (and other forms
of entertainment) all the time - so what. The “trick” of The Walking
Dead is to add in all the other stuff around those decisions to make the
player take it seriously. And it works - largely. Most of the time I did
weigh the options carefully. In the end I didn’t even mind the quick
time events, they served to add some sense of jeopardy and action into
the story - stay awake! I also liked that at the end of each episode the
big decisions you made were highlighted and compared to other players’
decisions. On average I went with the same decision as the majority, but
a few times I was in the minority. This mechanic allows the player (me,
at least) to rethink their decisions when the pressure is off and
consider other points of view - I stand by all of them!</p>

    <p>Imagine the scene: a person sits at their computer, credit card in hand,
about to happily pay money for a service they previously used for free.
A minute later, the credit card is back in their wallet unused. They
curse the service provider and vowing to never pay them money. They
furiously research alternatives to the service, it doesn’t take long to
find something suitable.</p>

<p>This happened to me last night. I have used Dropbox (no link as I don’t
want to give them even a small amount of Google link karma) for some
time and recently exceeded my space allowance. Fair enough, time to just
pay them the money and become a proper customer - their service had
worked very well for me. Navigating to their payment page I saw the cost
was a reasonable 99 US dollars, so I filled in the form. As I have a UK
credit card, I switched the country to the UK. And then the price
changed to 79 British pounds. Huh? 79 GBP is not 99 USD, it is 125 USD.
Dropbox wanted to charge me 25% more for not being American. The air
turned blue with expletives I don’t care to repeat. Come on Dropbox, are
foreign customers that much more expensive? Does it really cost that
much extra in net traffic fees to send all my data to the NSA? If it was
just a few percent extra I wouldn’t care, transaction costs and currency
fluctuations could explain it. But 25%, no way!</p>

<p>Never will I be a paying Dropbox customer, never will I have a nice
thing to say about them. It took barely a few minutes to find a
competing service to use instead. I don’t need them and will transition
to other systems. Another company for the <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-of-which-i-am-not-a.html">companies of which I am not a
customer</a>
list.</p>

and from <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/podcast/">its own
site</a></p>

<p>The Ancient Warfare Magazine Podcast, as the name implies, is produced
as part of the bi-monthly <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/">paper magazine of the same
name</a>. I’ve
never read the magazine, so I can’t comment on it. One episode of the
podcast is released for each issue of the magazine (although normally a
few months later) and on the same topic, such as the <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-v.1/">Gaius
Marius</a>,
<a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-vii.4/">Logistics</a>
or the <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-viii.4/">Seleucid Empire at
War</a>.
However the content is never just a repeat of the articles. Instead the
podcasts assumes the listener has read the corresponding magazine, or is
at least familiar with the topic at hand and then starts from there. The
format is a roundtable discussion for around half an hour, going
wherever the conversation leads. Production values are high.</p>

<p>This is not a basic history of events podcast. Listeners will need a
good understanding of ancient war and battles just to start. For
instance in discussing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg
Forest</a>,
no mention is made of the battle or it’s result. Instead there is debate
on why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius">Arminus</a> decided to go
from ally to enemy of Rome, and how the battle caused terror in Rome
despite its distance. The podcast on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadochi">Hellenistic Successor
States</a> assumes listeners know
the difference between the Greek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hoplite">Hoplite
Phalanx</a> and the Macedonian
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarissa">Sarisa Phalanx</a>. Talk on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar’s</a> campaign’s
barely mentions his battles or career. It focuses entirely on his
self-aggrandisement and how he made his own luck partly with
well-trained, experienced and trusting soldiers - postulating he had no
grand plan, but just took advantage of situations as they occurred.</p>

<p>The discussion is normally quite interesting. There is a strong focus on
Greek, Hellenistic and Roman history, but not overwhelmingly so. Other
western and near eastern cultures are also represented. I would guess
the is roughly proportional to how much the remaining sources can tell
us (which is predominately Greek &amp; Roman as they tended to write things
down). However, it is disappointing that there is no mention (so far) of
cultures far from the Mediterranean - India, China, or the Americas.
Often some surprising thoughts come up. That the uniform of a Roman
legionary was anything but uniform (despite what the movies and TV
show), with the men modifying or replacing their equipment as they saw
fit. The huge advantage in steadfastness and maneuverability that came
with professional soldiers, be it Alexander’s phalanx, Athens’ rowers,
or Rome’s legions. How many generals had an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</a> complex,
comparing themselves to him (Caesar and Trajan) or mindlessly aping him - the successor kings even copied his slightly twisted neck. I was also
surprised to discover that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad">Sargon</a> claimed to have
just over 5000 soldiers when he conquered Mesopotamia - armies were
clearly much smaller 4000 years ago.</p>

<p>An informative discussion-based podcast on narrowly focused (warfare
based) topics for listeners who already know the basic details.</p>
