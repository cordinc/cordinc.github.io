  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The last few years I have written annually about <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">the performance of my
Funding Circle P2P investment</a>. Last
year, despite good returns, I mentioned that I has begun to
significantly reduce that investment. Soon after I stopped reinvesting
in any new loans and starting moves to have my capital and profit
withdrawn. Thus there is little point in giving details on the returns.</p>

<p>Most of my money was returned reasonably quickly (over a couple of
weeks). Although, at this moment nearly a year since starting the
draw-down process, some 5% of my original investment is still in the FC
account. I expect another 2% will be returned soon, but have no idea
when the last 3% will get back to me. This delay is something FC
investors should consider.</p>

<p>In the current FC system there are two ways to get your money out of
loans. Firstly, you can wait for the loans to be completely paid back.
As some loans can be for 60 months, this will take a while. Secondly,
you can request that FC sell your loans to other investors. Previously
this sale could be performed on a loan-by-loan basis with seller
determined discounts or premiums to the loans
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value">NPV</a>. However, under
FC’s newish aggregate loan system, you can only specify the monetary
amount you wish to sell, and FC does the rest. This process takes a few
weeks (the shortest for me was a week, the longest 5 weeks).</p>

<p>The problem occurs because FC refuses to sell any loan that is
delinquent in its repayments. That seems fair. With the new aggregate
loan system the purchaser of the loan is not choosing the loan, so
receiving one in arrears is not a good deal. I would expect most late
loans would either get back on schedule reasonably quickly (and can thus
be sold) or become bad debt (which is essentially a loss). So I was
surprised to discover that 3% of my portfolio is in loans that are
incredibly late. One of them is over 500 days late! Another 3 are over a
year late! I would have thought a loan that hasn’t made a repayment in
more than 12 months is actually in default, but FC obviously disagree.</p>

<p>So remember, even after you want to stop, a little bit of your money
will be stuck in FC for a long time. That should be counted against any
potential profit. In my experience, the returns have still been much
better than a bank, so I don’t regret it, I’m just a little annoyed that
I am unable to close the account properly.</p>

    <p>Here we are 5 months into the year, and I am only just writing <a href="https://www.cordinc.com/blog/2018/01/goals-2018.html">my
annual goals review/plan
post</a>. That delay
should give an indication to the importance such goals have this year.
It has been a bad start to the year, so I’m not going to set any new
objectives. Instead, ending the year in nearly the same state as it
started will be considered great success. For the remainder of this year
I just hope to continue exercising, continue some small fun projects
when possible, and work out what to do next.</p>

<p>For reference, last year my unambitious goals were to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep exercising - achieved, my personal bests have lept forward over
the last 18 months.</li>
  <li>keep learning Spanish - I kept up with regular lessons, but
discovered the limitations of mainly studying online. While staying
in Spain I can generally make myself understood. However, I am
completely hopeless at understanding native Spanish speakers
(demasiado rapido!). Under current circumstances, I am not certain I
will be able to continue with lessons.</li>
  <li>blog occasionally - 7 blog posts in a year, so that counts as very
occasional! I imagine this year with be similar.</li>
  <li>release Concealed Intent 1.3 - achieved, but that is the only
gamedev related task I even started.</li>

    <p>It has been a while since I went somewhere new for a holiday, so earlier
this month I spent a few days in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavik</a>, Iceland. It
was all organised on short notice, and during most of the trip the
weather was overcast (so no Aurora), but the country is well worth a
visit.</p>

<p>My best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/reykjavik_18.html">available
here</a>.</p>

    <p>Some people may know that over 20 years ago a did a little <a href="/blog/2011/07/can-tweety-fly.html">postgrad
research into computational logic</a>.
While not much benefit came out of that work, it did give me an interest
in logic. So when it came time to refresh my
<a href="/blog/tag/Scala.html">Scala</a> skills, I thought it might be interesting
to try creating a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)">logical
resolution</a> system. A
toy version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>.</p>

<p>Now it is finished, and it doesn’t seem so bad. With some work it could
even grow to a full Prolog implementation. It might even be useful in
its currently limited state. So I have decided to opensource and release
it through Gitlab.</p>

<p>If interested it is <a href="https://gitlab.com/cordinc/logic">available here</a>.</p>

<p>FYI: Gitlab seems like a decent online repo site, so in the future I may
put other projects under <a href="https://gitlab.com/cordinc">my page there</a>.</p>

    <p>You may of heard about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
recently? Or maybe just received a flood of privacy policy updates?</p>

<p>It is time for one more. Previously this website used some Google 3rd
party services that may track visitors (Adsense, Analytics and Search).
I have now turned them all off. It was a fairly easy decision to make. I
haver tracked the site analytics for many years, so why keep it on? Same
for the ads. In over 10 years of running this blog I have earned a few
pennies over £75. No loss to turn it all off.</p>

<p>There is still one service on this site that may use cookies and
tracking, if you are one of their customers already. That is
<a href="https://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a>, who provide the comments system at the
bottom of most pages. Their GDPR statement is <a href="https://blog.disqus.com/update-on-privacy-and-gdpr-compliance">available
here</a></p>

<p><strong>Update (2021-02-21):</strong> Commenting has been disabled, so no more potential GDPR issues there!</p>
