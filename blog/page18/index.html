<p>Despite being nearly a decade old, I still enjoy playing <a href="http://defensegrid.hiddenpath.com">Defense
Grid</a>, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_defense">tower
defense</a> game that largely
defines the genre for me. Here is a video of me just this week
completing the final story mission without losing a core - it only took
me several years!</p>

<p>Ever wondered how things would be if you were just a single cell, living
a simple cell life? Floating around, absorbing your smaller neighbours,
desperately avoiding being absorbed by your larger neighbours? Well
wonder no more, as that is exactly the theme behind
<a href="http://www.osmos-game.com">Osmos</a>, a vaguely physics based puzzler,
that aims to be relaxing, but often ends up exceedingly frustrating.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.shawnbeckgames.com/velocibox">Velocibox</a> describes itself as
a hardcore twitch-heavy endless-runner. That is definitely all true.
After a couple of hours of play I have reached level 2 once (getting
through level 1 takes seconds if done correctly). This game requires the
reflexes of a fighter-pilot! It is super-hard. It is also well-designed
and easy to just keep playing.</p>

<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/448830/">ASMR Universe</a>, what is it?
I don’t think it is a game, instead it is a tool for creating
soundscapes. It is very simple and very roughly constructed, but maybe
something certain people want.</p>

    <p>Part 1 is <a href="/blog/2016/08/rbs-1.html">available here</a>.</p>

<p>As the <a href="/blog/2016/08/rbs-1.html">SCRS project</a> at RBS began to come to
a finish, the team started to disperse. I was the last technical person
to leave and to prevent me leaving RBS entirely, the SCRS project manger
arranged for my contract to transfer over to the Sales Account Opening
(SAO) project so I could still be around if SCRS needed me. They didn’t,
so my last 9 months at RBS were spent on the largest most dysfunctional
IT project I have ever seen.</p>

<p>SAO aimed to allow potential and existing customers of RBS to open
accounts online. Current accounts, savings, credit cards, overdrafts,
the whole range of retail account should be available. Basically it was
a set of webpages that took a customer’s information, and then passed it
through to various backend systems to actually create the account and
send out any required paper forms. At the time many banks were setting
up similar systems - now it is expected functionality for a bank’s
online presence, but still fairly new for most banks in early 2004 when
I started on the project. The technical difficulty was not particularly
high, but greatly complicated by non-technical factors. The final system
had to integrate with the existing customer database and credit checking
systems. The information collected had to meet anti-money laundering,
fraud and terrorism laws (collectively referred to as “Know Your
Customer” or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer">KYC</a>).
Security and reliability had to be bulletproof as this was a public
website and must inspire confidence in potential customers. The site
also needed to look pretty, well-designed and enticing. The webpages
needed to conform to UK &amp; EU disability laws, so blind people or people
unable to use a mouse or a raft of other issues should still be able to
use the system easily. Also, RBS owned a number of subsidiary banks.
They would all use this system too since they all shared the same
backend. This meant the webpages had to change branding, wording and
structure to match the bank being viewed.</p>
