  <div class="content">
    <p>As it now seems to be an
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/04/funding-circle-update.html">annual</a>
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/06/funding-circle.html">tradition</a>,
here is my end-of-financial year report on <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding
Circle</a>. The peer-to-peer website has
certainly flourished over the past 12 months. Many positive stories
about the site and its competitors have appeared in the popular press.
The volume of loans available has greatly increased. Right now 66 loans
are available for funding, and that is lower than a normal day. The
increase in loans does not seem to be matched by an increase in lenders
(despite the <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/about-us/our-blog/government-to-start-lending-to-businesses-through-funding-circle">government
joining</a>).
Thus interest rates have been increasing over the last few months. Has
this translated into better returns, or has financial stress created
more bad debts?</p>

<p>After last year’s disappointing ~2% return, no extra money was
deposited, so the maths for this year’s return is easy to calculate.
Here is the summary.</p>

<p>Gross: 8.4%<br />
After Fees: 7.4%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 4.1%</p>

<p>Much better than last year.</p>

<p>Interestingly the gross and after-fees returns are roughly the same as
last year. Any increase in rates has come too late to make much of an
impact on the full year results. The improved return is largely due to
net bad debt. The rate at which loans goes bad has only decreased a
little - just under 5% this year by value, compared to just over 5% last
year. However, this year debt recovery has added 1.6% to the return,
compared to 0 last year. The recovery process is slow and these extra
returns are mainly from last years losses.</p>

<p>Funding Circle now claims I have a return of 4.3. Much closer to my
figures than last year. Although, they have added a note to the figure
stating it is the annualised return since joining the site. This seems
about right, so I’m no longer concerned by the discrepancy. The site
also claims I should be earning 5.8, so again my bad debt rate is higher
than “normal”. I made a conscious decision to have a slightly higher
than average risk profile on my loans (by lending to firms with a
slightly worse than average credit rating). Even taking this into
account, according to Funding Circle’s own numbers, I have bad luck.
This is surprising considering how steady bad debt has been over the
last two years. Will it even out next year, or is 5% about the right
rate of deliquency?</p>

<p>What next? For various reasons not related to performance, no extra
money will be deposited. Nor will any money be withdrawn - I’m more
comfortable how the system is working, and it is still better than a
bank. So until next year the status quo will continue.</p>

    <p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ancient-world/id517589332">iTunes</a>
and on the blog, <a href="http://ancientworldpodcast.blogspot.com/">The Ancient
World</a></p>

<p>This history podcast originally aimed to cover all history from the
earliest civilizations until the start of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity">classical
age</a> (around 500BC).
The presenter, Scott Chesworth, just thought such a history was required
and couldn’t find one - so did it himself. The series covers a great
deal of material over its 36 audio-only episodes (each around half an
hour in length and of good production quality). An ambitious
undertaking.</p>

<p>The podcast starts with the invention of irrigation and the formation of
the first cities in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer">Sumer</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam">Elam</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</a>. The next couple of
episodes carry on with the beginnings of civilization in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">Harappa</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_china#Ancient_China">China</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization">Crete</a>. There is also
mention of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norte_Chico_civilization">Norte
Chico</a> in Peru,
the oldest known American civilisation, and new to me. However, after
that the series focuses almost exclusively on the well documented
history of the ancient Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean. This is
largely due to much of the history of these areas surviving through to
the present day on stone monuments and clay tablets. Scott admits as
much in the final episode, stating he couldn’t find enough details on
individuals or events in other areas to make it entertaining and fit it
with the style of the show. This means that iron age
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan">Canaan</a> (as covered extensively in
the Bible and researched by Bible-historians) is described in far more
detail than China and India combined. Similarly when discussing the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire">Persians</a> most
information is on their dealings with other civilisations, while their
interactions with Central Asian societies is largely unknown.</p>

<p>The podcasts run in roughly chronological order. A particular region at
a particular time will be presented. Followed by another region
overlapping in both time and geography. It can become a bit of a
tick-tock of events and people. This perhaps to be expected given the
breadth of material to be covered, and that most of it comes from kings
extolling their personal exploits. There is not much indication of how
things worked or how life was lived at the time. Occasionally some
details come through, like the discussion of the diplomatic letters
traded between kings just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_age_collapse">bronze age
collapse</a> showing the
ancient world to be very well connected. Scott livens up the flow of
facts when he can with little asides or appeals to modern sensitivities.
Thus the Minoans are “awesome” partly for having no discernable
military; a particularly cruel act is “positively
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria">Assyrian</a>”; and the faux-credulous
manner when retelling the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I#Accession">Darius I’s accession to the Persian
throne</a>. It was also
interesting to hear how large the Persian Empire became under Darius
(perhaps 45% of the world’s population) and how it was run in a tolerant
manner with the local customs and sometimes even the leadership of a
province (known as a satrapy) remaining unchanged.</p>

<p>While it might not achieve its lofty goal (as explained below), this
series does provide a great deal of information on an underrepresented
period of history (online at least). Not many other podcasts will
describe ancient Sumer,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire">Akkad</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni">Mittani</a>. It is definitely worth
a listen, and thanks Scott for filling the gap.</p>

    <p>On first arrival in <a href="/blog/2012/12/kuala-lumpur-1.html">Kuala Lumpur</a> we
stayed in the housing within the British High Commission compound. This
was intended as a short-term measure while a permanent home was found.
However, for various reasons we stayed there for just over a year. The
final trigger to leave was the sale of the compound itself (otherwise we
might still be there). Soon the compound site will be redeveloped.</p>

    <p>Since my <a href="/blog/2013/10/day-trips.html">last travel post</a>, we have been
on a few more short holidays.</p>

<p>First a couple of friends from London came to visit for a couple of
days. Certainly long enough to experience Kuala Lumpur, but not enough
to properly leave the city. We still managed a couple of trips to
greenery inside the city itself - including a hike in Bukit Gasing, a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Caves">Batu Caves</a> visit and walk
around the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur_Bird_Park">Bird
Park</a>.</p>

<p>We then made a weekend trip to Singapore for a friend’s pre-wedding
lunch (the actual ceremony was in London, but many friends/family lived
in Singapore). The city is far larger, greener and more open than I
expected.</p>

<p>Christmas was spent near Cherating. We arrived just after the east coast
floods subsided. Our hotel informed us we were the first booking they
hadn’t had to cancel after the property was inundated! As a result the
whole area was deserted. We also drove up the coast to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terengganu">Terengganu</a> and had excellent
stuffed crab at Tong Juan in Kemaman.</p>

<p>Lastly, I spent a few more days in Hong Kong. <a href="/blog/2013/07/hong-kong.html">My opinions of the
city</a> have not changed.</p>

<p>I have combined some of the best photos into a short slideshow,

  <div class="content">
    <p>Did you think I forgot? Or, perhaps trying to hide the ugly truth. Last
year I wrote that my only <a href="/blog/2013/01/goals-2.html">goal for 2013</a>
was to “finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level.”
Failed. Not even close. An alpha version was sent out to friends in
August and the feedback was “too complex”. Since then the game has been
largely rewritten to make the gameplay mechanics more straightforward.
Only now is it returning to the “early alpha” level of 6 months ago. To
be honest, even if the feedback was positive and no rewrite was
necessary, Concealed Intent still probably would not be finished by now,
but it would be close.</p>

<p>Thus my goal for 2014 is just a copy of last year’s goal:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level. I want
to complete the game to at least public beta where it just requires
some fine-tuning and bug-fixing. The aim is to sell the finished
game and at least break even.</li>
</ul>

<p>Even my minor goals will be repeats from last year. Previously, I said I
would like to post around 3 blogs/month and exercise 3 times a week. I
achieved both of these (apart from when ordered not to exercise <a href="/blog/2013/05/less-of-a-man.html">after
surgery</a>). So my “nice to manage” list
is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog on my personal website at least 3 times a month, but less than
4 times a month. Post at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/">Jarrah
Technology</a> at least once a month.
Also try to be more active on other online media, eg Twitter,
Facebook (which is huge in Malaysia), etc.</li>
  <li>Exercise. No specific target, just try to improve my fitness levels
and continue weightlifting (which I have started in the last year).
Try to stay injury-free.</li>
</ul>
