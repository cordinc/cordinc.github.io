  <div class="content">
    <p>Nearly <a href="/blog/2011/01/a-global-history-of-architectu.html">3 years ago I
wrote</a> about
receiving the textbook “A Global History Of Architecture” in return for
the use of one of my photos of Pompeii. When I discovered the
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> course given online by one of the authors and
using this textbook, I had to signup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Global-History-Architecture-Francis-Advisor/dp/0470402571/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293707766&amp;sr=8-2"><img src="/assets/posts/global_history_of_architecture.jpg" alt="A Global History Of Architecture" /></a></p>

<p>The couse is called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-4-605x-global-history-architecture-884">A Global History Of
Architecture</a>
(yes, the same as the textbook), available through
<a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a> and instructed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jarzombek">Mark
Jarzombek</a>. EdX is another
of the online university course providers, similar to the previously
discussed <a href="/blog/tag/Coursera.html">Coursera</a> although with a different
(but strangely overlapping) set of universities involved. Other than
graphic design, there is very little difference between EdX and
Coursera; the manner of instruction, facilities and testing are all
largely the same. A student should just signup wherever they find
interesting courses.</p>

<p>At 12 weeks this is very long for an online course - 8 weeks of lectures
regularly interspersed by 4 weeks with just an exam. The exams barely
qualify as such. None took me more than 20 minutes (the notes suggest an
hour) to complete the various multiple choice and categorisation
questions. Each lecture week includes over 3 hours of video instruction
(cut up into roughly 10 minute segments) with mini-tests. However, these
videos are not specially made for EdX. They are actual university
lectures from MIT - the back of the original students’ heads can
sometimes be seen. The lectures are the jewel in this course. Professor
Jarzombek presents well and is clearly talking on topics that greatly
interest him.</p>

<p>While the topic is nominally architectural history, it is more a general
history of the world illuminated with architectural examples (more <a href="/blog/2011/07/a-history-of-the-world-in-100.html">A
History of the World in 100
Objects</a> than <a href="/blog/2013/09/hsar-252-roman-architecture.html">Roman
Architecture</a>). There is
also regular and interesting discussion of trade flows and migration
patterns through history and how these promoted the interchange of ideas
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memes">memes</a> I suppose). The course
suggests many civilisations rose and fell with changing trade routes.
For instance, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Empire">Khmer
Empire</a> centred on modern day
Cambodia rose on the southward movement of trade between Europe and
China due to climatic changes around 600-1400AD. With the rise of the
Mongols the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_route">Silk
Route</a> re-established itself
and sea based trade diminished along with the fortunes of the Khmer.
However, before this happened Indian stonesmiths and architects brought
their religions and architectural styles to the booming region. Another
example is that statues of Buddha only began to appear once Buddhist
monks traveling along trade routes from India to China encountered the
Hellenistic (and statue producing) societies in central Asia (remnants
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire">Alexander the Great’s
empire</a>). This occurred
centuries after the religion was founded.</p>

<p>The course starts with the beginnings of human society and takes two
weeks before reaching the first towns and cities of the Middle East.
This sets the scene for the nature of the lectures - most time is spent
on art, religion, trade and the way people lived. Then this background
is used to explain the reasons why, how and where certain buildings are
constructed. The mechanics of various religions are particularly
important as most buildings that survive over 1000 years (or were
written about) held some religious significance. There is also regular
discussion of how buildings model certain ideas. The columns of Greek
temples supposedly represent forest groves; the peaks of Hindu temples
model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meru">Mount Meru</a>; the palace
at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis">Persepolis</a> is a giant
meeting ground (like an ancient convention centre). Sometimes this idea
can be quite abstract. Etruscan temples (which along with Greek temples,
influenced the Romans) were supposed to model the movement of birds
flying through the air.</p>

<p>There is also some discussion of how buildings change over time. Many
buildings change usage over time. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon">Parthenon</a> has been a temple,
church, mosque, ruin and tourist site over its 2500 year history. Other
buildings grow in importance and are thus modified. Egyptian temples
grew in power by adding new parts to the building. Churches and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa">stupas</a> generally can’t be
expanded, so instead sites that became more important just built more
churches and stupas.</p>

<p>This is a thought-provoking rush through human history from the first
societies to colonialism. The course presents history via the forces
acting on cultures, unlike the standard tick-tock of historical events.
An interesting perspective and certainly worth a viewing of the
lectures. You also might learn a little about architecture.</p>

<p><em>Sandu Jayasinghe @ 2016-09-10</em> - hey i signed up for the course this year and am kind of nervous about it. I was hoping u to enlighten me on how tough the course and the exams are. as im already a university student and hence won’t have much time to spend on the online course. thanks</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-09-10</em> - Hi, I don’t remember the assessments being particularly hard in this course. There were weekly tests consisting of multiple choice or categorisation questions. They generally took me half the time they were supposed to take. Same with the final exam. The main issue is finding the time to watch the videos and other materials. I remember that being many hours per week. Anyway, all that was over 3 years ago, it may have changed since then. In any case good luck!</p>

<p><em>Sandu Jayasinghe @ 2016-09-11</em> - thanks a lot for the information and for replying. it was helpful</p>

  Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Kickstarter.html">Kickstarter</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> website allows people to
pledge money towards the completion of various projects (games, movies,
products, or lots of other ideas). Usually the project organisers give
something in return and keep in communication with backers. I joined
last September specifically to back a certain project (see the first
project below). Since then I have backed 10 more projects. My only rule
(so far) is never to back a project at a level which includes physical
goods - I don’t need more stuff.</p>

<p>It appears to be an emerging tradition to detail the result of backing
Kickstarter projects. As I haven’t backed a new project in nearly 3
months, and many have finished, it seemed a good time to reflect on my
experiences. In order of when I pledged, my backed projects are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">Project
Eternity</a>
<em><span class="ongoing 14, Apr due 12, Sep pledged"></span></em> - Me and
nearly 74,000 of my mates backed this little computer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">RPG</a>. It is one of
the more successful Kickstarters, and is the reason I joined the
site. It is being built to a similar design and by a similar team to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planescape:_Torment">Planescape:
Torment</a> - that is
enough of a sales pitch for me, I pledged enough to get a copy on
release. Since being funded, the project team sends weekly updates
on their progress. I am fairly comfortable waiting for this game.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/10x10room/conclave">Conclave</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Feb due 12, Sep pledged"></span></em> - This
project was backed on a a whim when it appeared unlikely it would
reach its target. Now I understand that total pledges tend to surge
in the final day, as it did in this successful project. It is a
HTML5 RPG game where the first 10 missions are free (<a href="http://www.playconclave.com/">playable
here</a>). The team delivered all they
promised, largely on time. I have played through about half the
current game and it is a decent enough distraction for a couple of
hours. No regrets here.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035580424/blackspace-plan-dig-defend-survive">Blackspace</a>
<em><span class="unsuccessful 12, Oct pledged"></span></em> - The only
project I backed that did not reach its funding goal. This is a
computer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">RTS</a> game
when the player builds and defends facilities on asteroids. I had a
very similar idea and was keen to see how theirs’ looked.
Unfortunately, little progress has been made (if any) since the
funding failure - a pity.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/sir-you-are-being-hunted">Sir, You Are Being
Hunted</a>
<em><span class="late 13, Jul due 12, Nov pledged"></span></em> - A very
cool looking “tweedpunk”
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">FPS</a> game where
you are hunted by robots dressed like English country gentlemen. The
game is in alpha and available on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>. It is technically running
late, but since the current version is playable and the
oversubscribed kickstarter resulted in many stretch goals, I’m not
worried.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1473965863/sui-generis">Sui
Generis</a>
<em><span class="ongoing 14, May due 12, Nov pledged"></span></em> - A very
impressive and ambitious tech demo for this computer RPG led me to
back it. There were a number of original ideas planned for the game
and I deemed it worth a try. Since then communication has been
sporadic, but gameplay videos show progress. I just doubt this can
be finished in the next 6 months, even another year seems like a
stretch to me. Hopefully the team won’t run out of money or descope
too heavily. Perhaps they could license their engine to other
developers.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core">Fate Core</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Feb due 13, Jan pledged"></span></em> -
Another massively oversubscribed Kickstarter for a pen &amp; paper RPG.
There were so many stretch goals achieved on this one the value for
money became too good to pass up, even for people with only a
passing interest. Most of the backer rewards have been delivered (a
couple of the later stretch goals remain), and the quality seems
very high.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/enworld/rebuilding-en-world">EN
World</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Mar due 13, Jan pledged"></span></em> -
Before this Kickstarter I was aware of the <a href="http://www.enworld.org/">EN
World</a> website and considering joining to
help find local RPG groups (I didn’t join because it turns out
Facebook is the way RPG’ers connect in Malaysia). Then the site was
hacked and went to raise money to resurrect the site offering a ton
of pen &amp; paper RPG rewards for backers. Now the site is back (and I
joined, but mainly for the news) and the high-quality rewards
distributed (so many I haven’t had the opportunity to go through
them all yet!).</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2005963869/jeff-cannatas-new-show">Jeff
Cannata</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Apr due 13, Mar pledged"></span></em> - For
many years I watched Jeff Cannata as one of the 3 hosts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Totally_Rad_Show">The
Totally Rad
Show</a>. It was a
free, fun and informative podcast. When he went to Kickstarter to
raise money for a new (although similar) podcast, I felt he deserved
some money from me for the hours of entertainment already provided.
Even better, my mate Jeff has now delivered the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CannataJeff">Newest Latest
Best</a> podcast. It lacks the
chemistry of TRS, but is still very good and I happily watch it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/achtung-cthulhu-the-ww2-keepers-and-investigators">Achtung
Cthulhu!</a>
<em><span class="delivered partially 13, Aug due 13, Mar pledged"></span></em> -
Cthulhu mythos adventures during World War 2. This pen &amp; paper RPG
was an easy sell to me. The original products from the Kickstarter
have been delivered, with the numerous stretch goal rewards still to
come. The quality of the books exceeded my expectations - very
impressive. I have also started playing in a AC! game and can
strongly recommend it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1281758745/professional-mp3-background-loops-for-role-playing">RPG Background
Loops</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Aug due 13, Apr pledged"></span></em> - This
set of 80 background loops (each 10 minutes long) for RPG games was
backed on a whim. They are fine, but I’m not sure when I will get to
use them.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/545820095/weird-wars-rome-savage-worlds">Weird Wars
Rome</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Sep due 13, Aug pledged"></span></em> - Like
Achtung Cthulhu, an easy sell with a combination of Cthulhu mythos
in an Ancient Rome environment. Unfortunately, I have been
unimpressed with the quality of the delivered book - much lower than
the other Kickstarters I’ve backed. Disappointing.</li>
</ul>

<p>So after 10 projects backed successfully, only one is (forgivably) late,
one is a concern, and one had a disappointing result. I consider that a
good result and wouldn’t be apprehensive about backing more.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> mining is a method of turning
electricity into money. That aphorism percolated around my mind for some
time until it dawned that I don’t currently pay the full cost of
electricity. Unfortunately, while that situation has existed nearly a
year, it will end in a month. Cursing my sloth, I decided to experiment
with mining Bitcoins on my PC, and see how much profit can be made from
spare electricity.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is the most popular and valuable form of crypto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency">digital
currencies</a>. That is, a
form of money that exists only in digital form and is “created” through
the solving of cryptographic problems (known as “mining”). There is no
government or bank backing Bitcoin - so if there is a problem it is
largely down to the community to look after itself. However, the
problems solved by “mining” are actually checks on Bitcoin transactions,
thus it is quite hard to hack the currency itself (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24871444">hacking banks that
hold Bitcoin balances</a> is
another issue entirely). From its origin in 2009 Bitcoin has continually
grown in presence and value - at the time of writing it is <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/">US$228 to
the Bitcoin</a>.</p>

<p>So I put my ageing desktop to work. Three years ago it was a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/01/building-a-new-pc.html">top end
gaming box</a>,
now it is middle of the road. Especially the Nvidia graphics card which
is utilised heavily in mining calculations. After downloading a <a href="https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer">mining
program</a> and joining a <a href="https://www.btcguild.com/">mining
pool</a> (which combines members’ efforts and
shares the proceeds), my PC was dedicated to its task. After 72 hours of
continuous mining I accumulated 0.0004 Bitcoins - just under 8 US cents.
It was actually worse than that as the pool only pays out in units of
0.01 Bitcoins, so it would have taken mining 72 more days before
receiving anything. Not really worthwhile.</p>

<p>The pool’s combined computing power increased 10% over just the 4 days I
was watching, and apparently this is consistent with growth in total
power devoted to Bitcoin mining. Thus the amount earnt by a miner with
fixed power (like my PC) should decrease at the same rate (over
10%/week) - a rapid decline. Bitcoin mining is increasing exponentially
and as the supply is released at a fixed rate, only more powerful mining
rigs now earn back their costs. The most powerful miners are special
built <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC
machines</a>,
normal PCs can’t compete. It may be after electricity and purchase costs
even the new purpose built equipment can’t compete either! It seems only
the manufacturers are profiting - just like the gold rushes of old.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency, just the most well known and
developed. There are many others (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">list of some is
here</a>). Some use
a different type of calculation for different purposes, for example
adding inflation or making it harder to use specially built miners. I
did the same experiment (same machine, same time period) with two lesser
known and less liquid currencies: <a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> and
<a href="http://feathercoin.com/">Feathercoin</a>.</p>

<p>If I mined continuously for 100 days at late October 2013 difficulty and
market prices, the result would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin -&gt; 0.013 btc = US$2.60</li>
  <li>Litecoin -&gt; 5.2 ltc = US$10.40</li>
  <li>Feathercoin -&gt; 224 ftc = US$15.68</li>
</ul>

<p>All of which are probably less than the cost of electricity used. I
doubt anyone is going to get rich unless they buy high end machines or
specialist equipment - and take some large risks.</p>

<p>The experiment is now over.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Politics.html">Politics</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Like millions of others I watched the entertaining Paxman vs Brand
interview with great interest. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Paxman">Jeremy
Paxman</a> is deservedly known
as a tough interviewer, regularly savaging experienced politicians. He
is the interviewer that asked an evasive UK minister the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uwlsd8RAoqI">same question
12 times</a>. Here he is
overshadowed by the comedian/actor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Brand">Russell
Brand’s</a> eloquence, humour
and anger.</p>

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/3YR4CseY9pk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>When Brand talks about the disconnect between politicians and the
populace I think he’s right. When he talks about revolution I have to
disagree, not because his preferred replacement society is distasteful,
but because it is unlikely to result from revolution or be stable if it
did (think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm">Orwell’s Animal
Farm</a>). However, what he said
about voting was very interesting.</p>

<p>Russell Brand has apparently never voted. This is because he thinks none
of the options available are worth a vote. Paxman finds this a problem.
So do I, but in a different way. The purpose of voting in the UK is to
capture the desires of the population towards which party should govern.
Most constituencies only give a voter a choice of two realistic options,
in safe seats there is only one option (hopefully that is the one you
want!). It is likely that a valid vote comes down to choosing the least
of two evils. Brand is saying he chooses neither evil. A view with which
I have some sympathy and I suspect many others do too.</p>

<p>The situation is worse in Australia where it is illegal not to vote
correctly. This translates into it being a fineable offence not to turn
up to a voting station on election day, since it is a secret ballot and
no one knows what is actually on your ballot paper. This has led people
with views similar to Russell Brand to suggest intentionally spoiling
your vote or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_vote">donkey voting</a>
as a protest. However, little attention is paid to these invalid votes
as people rationalise that they are due to stupidity.</p>

<p>In the “2010 UK General Election the turnout was
65”:http://www.ukpolitical.info/2010.htm. How many of the 35 that didn’t
vote are like Russell Brand, and how many didn’t care? How many of the
65% only voted out of obligation, because it is supposed to be the right
thing to do, but still sympathise with Brand? How many of the invalid
votes in Australia are a protest and how many are real errors? I’d like
to know.</p>

<p>Leaving aside questions on the voting or political system, here is a
simple suggestion to find out.</p>

<p>Add an official “None of the above” option to the bottom of all ballot
papers.</p>

<p>The “None of the above” votes could be ignored for the sake of deciding
a winner, but should be reported alongside the candidate totals. It is
important they are publicly reported. They would serve as an indication
of the democracy’s health. A low percentage of “none” votes suggest all
is well. A high percentage and the system has problems. Either the
candidates are not meeting the electorate’s desires or the voting system
as a whole is not working. As any management consultant will tell you,
the first step to solving a problem is measuring it.</p>

<p>I suspect the level of “none” votes would be disturbingly high, and this
is the main impediment to implementation. Politicians would be
embarrassed and their mandate weakened by a high level of “none” votes
in their constituency. It would take a person confident in their support
or egoless to happily to initiate such a change to the system. I’m not
sure these are common traits among current politicians. Still a little
embarrassment is a small price to quantify growing apathy and maybe
prevent the government sleepwalking into revolution (as Russell Brand
hopes). Counting “none” votes would provide the information in a public,
unambiguous and non-partisan manner.</p>

(<a href="http://pythonsweetness.tumblr.com/post/64740079543/how-to-lose-172-222-a-second-for-45-minutes">with the the most salient details extracted
here</a>).</p>

<p>I was always incredibly nervous when any of my “dangerous” code went
into production. This fear meant the code was reasonably well-tested (by
me). I was always part of the team releasing it and supporting it the
early next morning. Over 7 years, no one realised a loss due to a bug in
my code. There may have been some lost opportunities, but no actual
loss. Still, so many of the failings at Knight Capital sound familiar.
It wouldn’t have been impossible for this situation to occur at one of
the places I worked.</p>

<p>Below are my experiences related to the failings identified:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>There is the impression of time pressure.</strong> The new system had to
be released by a fixed date to match a change in an external market.
No doubt management were pushing staff to just get it done. In
front-office teams there was usually more tasks than people
available to complete them. Thus most common project size was one
person (so there was no one to check your work). Rarely was there
time to go back and fix things. It was assumed that the work would
be done fast and right the first time. Mistakes did occur.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><strong>A flag on the messaging system was repurposed.</strong> Why not just
create a new one to ensure no interaction with systems using the old
flag? I have seen this done many times and I once did it myself. No
one wanted to do it, but it saved time. Messaging infrastructure was
always handled by a separate back-office team and at one bank they
only updated message fields every few months. If a coder needed a
new field before this update they would have to reuse an old one.
There was little other option.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><strong>An old system lay unused for many years.</strong> All the banks had
numerous little programs listening to the message bus and working
away. All the places I worked were very keen to shutdown any unused
systems to free up computing resources. However, it is easy to
imagine one (or a bit of unused functionality in an otherwise used
system) slipping through the cull. With the average team member only
hanging around for a few years, knowledge of these old systems is
soon lost. Worse, sometimes other teams, without our knowledge,
created systems relying on our messages or databases (we couldn’t
restrict read-only access). We only discovered them when they phoned
to complain if we changed something (and we told them where to go).</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><strong>The new system was not deployed to one of the production
servers.</strong> Clearly the release process should be run from a script
that checks the result is correct and consistent. One bank had a
manual release process. Developers would wait until all the traders
had gone home and them manually copy and update files. At least a
shared drive was used by all the servers so only one copy was
required. Still it was error prone (releases regularly failed) and
hopefully they have changed it since. Little improvements were made
while I was there, but no one had the time to completely fix it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><strong>When errors started occurring 97 emails were sent detailing the
problem - all ignored.</strong> I’d be interested to know how many other
emails were sent. There were always floods of spurious error
messages caused by people logging problems at the wrong level or
just covering their behind (“but it sent an error email - someone
should have done something”). At two banks I got over a hundred
“error” messages per day from various systems. At first it really
caused concern, but others said that they could be safely ignored -
so they were ignored. It sent support people crazy, so there were
constant attempts to fix it with various degrees of success.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><strong>The issue was multiplied by removing the new system from
production servers.</strong> This is so understandable in the banking IT
culture. If there is a problem just after a release the assumption
is always that the release caused it. Thus the release should be
“rolled-back”, returning the environment to the pre-release state.
Trading can then continue with the old version while IT can examine
the cause of the problem with less immediate concern. The pressure
to rollback can be intense, even if people are certain the problem
is not in the release - you need to be very sure of yourself. It is
like the old saying “no one ever lost their job buying IBM”, only
not quite in this case.</li>
</ul>

<p>I found front-office development strongly path dependent as we rarely
had time to fix or improve old non-bug issues in code. We were always
moving forward, relying on good staff (rather than process or
automation) to avoid or ameliorate problems. Over time things improved -
every bank had a better environment than the previous one. I never had a
major issue. It would be nice to think this is the result of ability and
competence. Although reports on incidents like Knight Capital’s show
that when the environment and process is poor, luck also plays a strong
role. I have some empathy for the developers at Knight Capital.</p>
