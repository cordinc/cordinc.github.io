Podcasts</a></p>

<p>It can sometimes seem as if <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open
University</a> provides an inexhaustible supply of
quality history podcasts, and here I review another. “Power and People
in Ancient Rome” is a 7 episode series (plus a short introduction
audio-only podcast) looking at structures for large-scale entertainment
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Ancient Rome</a>. Apart from
the introduction, all the episodes are video podcasts presented in
documentary fashion - images of the modern sites with narration. The
episodes range in length from 1 minute (12MB) to 5 minutes (54MB) are
available in 640x260 format (or smaller) with transcripts. Disturbingly,
the filenames include numbers suggesting there should be at least 15
episodes in total.</p>

<p>Prominent Roman citizens often commissioned public buildings glorify and
memorialise themselves and promote civic pride in Rome. Very rich Romans
(like the Emperors) sometimes built structures for large-scale
entertainment. These podcasts look at some of these buildings, why they
were constructed and what happened within them. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus">Circus
Maximus</a> was constructed
around the 1st century BC (and updated by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a>) could hold an
audience 150000 for chariot races. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Marcellus">Theatre of
Marcellus</a>, also
constructed by Augustus, could hold 14000 people. The famous
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a> built around 80AD
handled around 50000 people for gladiatorial events and other
spectacles. Its seating was organised by law so that only the richest
and most powerful could sit at the front, with bands of increasingly
poorer people behind them. The furthest seats were for women, even
slaves sat before them. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baths_of_Caracalla">Baths of
Caracalla</a> were an
extensive bath complex covering 30 acres, including pools, libraries and
gardens. These massive sites must have been impressive and almost
overpowering to the people of Rome.</p>

<p>Interesting and worth watching.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Time again to reassess and reset goals. Last year <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/01/new-goals-again.html">my goals
were</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog at an average rate of at least 4 times a month. Result:
achieved.</strong> - This was close, publishing the 48th post just a few
days before the end of the year. At points during the year I found
myself forcing out a post over a weekend (normally a history podcast
review), when the time could have been spent more fruitfully.</li>
  <li><strong>Only have 2 programming projects going at the same time. Result:
achieved.</strong> - This is a good system. I never did more than two
projects at once and worked to pre-decided completion points. As
well as the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/09/blender-ogre-beginner-for-begi.html">3D engine
animation</a>
and secret project (that didn’t work out), I also did
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/12/iminra.html">IMINRA</a> and a
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/08/java-nio-server-example.html">Java NIO
server</a>
and am currently working on another quiet project. However,
focussing on 1 or 2 things at a time and finishing them means that I
now have a long list of things I’d like to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete 3 Blender models. Result: not achieved.</strong> - I managed
one, the
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/07/blender-tutorial-mech-model-pa-3.html">robot</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain Queuesaurus and general ruby skills. Result: not
achieved.</strong> Barely did any programming outside of Java this year.</li>
  <li><strong>Run 5km in 25 minutes. Result: not achieved.</strong> - I was getting
somewhere on this goal until I injured my foot in August and haven’t
run since (it’s still injured).</li>
  <li><strong>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: achieved.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now for the coming year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Based on
experience of the last 2 years, this should be easy to manage and I
shouldn’t need to force myself to write anything.</li>
  <li>Only have 2 programming projects going at the same time. Despite the
backlog, I think this worked well. I will start on more of the quiet
project and more 3D programming (I want to try out
<a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>).</li>
  <li>Complete 2 Blender models - a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopolium">Thermopolium</a> and a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broch">Broch</a>.</li>
  <li>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Might be a little hard
this year as I plan on buying a new computer this month and I’ve
already divested the low hanging fruit.</li>
  <li>Run 5km in 27 minutes. After being inactive for many months I can’t
wait to have my foot in good condition again and start running
(although more carefully from now on).</li>
  <li>Work less, travel more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus as a nice to do, if I have time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain general Ruby and Scala skills.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Around six months ago I received an email on my Flickr account asking if
one of my photos (the Pompeii Basilica) could be used in a forthcoming
architecture book. A little suspicious at first, after some
investigation I decided it was probably a legimate request and there was
nothing to lose. So I gave my permission and expected nothing to occur
(but I did hope). Well last week <a href="http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470402571.html">A Global History of
Architecture</a>
(<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Global-History-Architecture-Francis-Advisor/dp/0470402571/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293707766&amp;sr=8-2">Amazon
UK</a>)
by Ching, Jarzombek &amp; Prakash turned up on the doorstep.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Global-History-Architecture-Francis-Advisor/dp/0470402571/ref=sr\_1\_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293707766&amp;sr=8-2"><img src="/assets/posts/global_history_of_architecture.jpg" alt="A Global History of
Architecture" /></a></p>

<p>It is a very impressive book. Clearly designed as a textbook, I can
easily imagine dipping in to read a passage now and then. Not being an
architect or historian, I’m not sure how good it is as a reference
source, but I can vouch for the quality of the production (including
many fine diagrams and photos - may I recommend the Pompeii Basilica on
page 155) and the breadth of content.</p>

<p>Here is the photo used (on page 155).</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/06/tilt.html">As previously noted</a>, I
don’t have a good track record with online poker. I resolved that before
playing again (since I still have a little money online) I would read
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Sklansky">David Sklansky’s</a> <a href="http://www.twoplustwo.com/books/poker/theory-of-poker/">The
Theory of Poker</a>
(published by <a href="http://www.twoplustwo.com/">2+2</a>) through twice, take
notes and write a review. Hopefully somewhere in that process some poker
knowledge has seeped into my cerebrum.</p>

<p>The Theory of Poker was first published in 1987, long before the
domination of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_hold_'em">No
Limit Texas Hold’em</a> in televised poker and the subsequent poker
boom. Thus it doesn’t focus on any particular form of poker, instead
providing examples from various types of the game. Having said that, in
my reading I concentrated on advice applicable to online Hold’em, as
that is what I play.</p>

    <p>Over a year ago I wrote here about a library I had written to work out
the <a href="/blog/2009/05/intrade-implied-interest-rates.html">implied interest rates available on
Intrade</a>. This
library was originally envisioned as a cloud application built on top of
the <a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>, but I
couldn’t get it working on that platform. I recently tried again and now
it works! The application is called <a href="http://iminra.appspot.com">Iminra - Implied Interest Rates on
Intrade</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Intrade has now shutdown with financial irregularities. So I
have <a href="/blog/2013/05/iminra-shutdown.html">shutdown Iminra</a> too.</p>
