    <p>Reading stories about the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/oct/31/paying-the-price-of-war-britain-makes-good-on-historic-debts">British government beginning to pay down some
of its World War I
debts</a>
reminded me of my old job. I know a few people who are probably quite
happy this is finally happening. This is not because they believe the UK
has too much debt and needs to pay it off, but because it will make
their jobs just a little easier, as it would have for me five years ago.</p>

<p>The background is that the UK raised a very large amount of debt to pay
for fighting WWI. Soon after the war was finished the debt was
refinanced into “consols” (along with some older bonds). These consols
are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_bond">perpetual bonds</a> (we
used to call them “perps”) - a very rare form of debt where the original
debt need never be paid back (it is the government’s choice). Instead
they just pay interest for ever (“in perpetuality”), unlike normal
government bonds which mature and the principal repaid after some set
period of time (commonly 5, 10, or 20 years). Thanks to inflation and a
low rate of interest, it has never been in the financial interest of the
UK government to cancel their consols (and thus repay the principal) -
it is very cheap debt. Presumably right now is the unusual occasion when
interest rates are so low that paying off the consols makes sense (at
least I hope so). Of course it is also good publicity for a government
strongly associated with austerity to pay off such symbolic long-term
debts.</p>

<p>These consols and other perps comprise a vanishingly small fraction of
UK debt and an even smaller proportion of traded debt (as the debt
holders don’t tend to sell them very often). Someone working in UK and
European bonds could pretend they don’t exist, and 99% of the time this
would not be a problem. Then there is the other 1% of the time.
Perpetual bonds have a different set of calculations for working out
their price and other maturity dependent values. When writing code for
pricing and trading bonds, testing should include perps to check they
are correctly handled. In the fast paced world of front-office IT, this
extra checking is sometimes forgotten. Normally nothing untoward
happened as a result. However, errors did occur, normally days after the
code was released (as it takes that long for a perp transaction to
occur). I was lucky enough never to have that particular problem while
working in a bank, although I did something similar once with uncommon
<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield_basis.asp">yield-quoted
bonds</a> and felt
like an idiot for forgetting such instruments existed (but it never
happened again - I always tested with them after that).</p>

<p>So congratulations to the technical people writing fixed income pricing
and trading systems. With the consols gone there is failure point
removed. Hopefully soon your code will be simpler and all the <code>if
(isPerp) { … </code> blocks can be deleted.</p>

    <p>Playing <a href="/blog/2014/08/eve-online.html">Eve</a> has really made me think
about the financials of online gaming with regards to digital goods.
Like most online games, Eve bans real money trading (RMT). That is, buy
or selling of in-game items for real-world money is forbidden. The
exception being that it is ok to buy PLEX (game time vouchers that can
be used in-game) from Eve or approved affiliates. A non-approved
reseller, Somer, was <a href="http://themittani.com/news/somer-blink-shutting-down">recently
shutdown</a>.</p>

<p>This intrigues me. It seems to me that real-world trading would make
players more engaged in a game. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">Second
Life</a> made a virtue of RMT and
didn’t seem to suffer ill affects from the policy (their problems seem
to originate in being over-hyped). So why do nearly all MMOs ban the
practice? Is it because the companies want to control the market for
selling these goods themselves? Maybe partially, but having a resale
value only increases the possible primary sale price and increases
demand. I’m not sure this is the main reason. Perhaps there are legal
issues? I’m no lawyer, so this is possible. An online investigation
discovered another possible reason -
<a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.hu/2013/02/avoiding-rmt-issue.html">avoiding</a>
<a href="http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/2013/02/whats-wrong-with-rmt.html">professionals</a>.</p>

<p>If it is possible to earn money from playing the game (through RMT),
then some people may find that that playing intensively results in
enough money to live (or thrive). This is definitely possible, even
although the activity is banned, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">gold
farming</a> in many games is
profitable enough to make a living. The now closed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_III">Diablo
3</a> auction house suffered a
similar problem. Some players acquired huge amount of loot and then sold
it so cheaply that other players without the same interest in grinding
would just buy it from them.</p>

<p>The problem seems to originate in the standard mechanics of such games.
In-game rewards come from endlessly repeatable activities - usually as
loot. Why get rewards for killing creatures? Why do those creatures
respawn over and over again? Why do the creatures have all this great
stuff on them (instead of leaving it at home) and why don’t they use it?
In some games, why can players carry so much? It is because these
loot-based rewards promote people playing - perform an action, get a
reward. Companies that produce these games want to discourage
professionalism so other players have a chance to partake in this
gamification. Introducing scarcity by limiting the spawning of enemies
would make the situation worse as this would make the resulting rewards
even more valuable.</p>

<p>To have RMT and reduce professionalism, these games would need to stop
repetition of gameplay as the basis for rewards - like Minecraft. Or,
stop repetition of the core gameplay, by perhaps time-limiting players
(but then a pro might have many characters or a whole team). Or, co-opt
the professionals’ activities into creating content for other players.
This last options seems the best, but is it possible or even desirable?
Eve manages it a little with its null sec sovereignity and corporations,
but at the expense of large-scale player-vs-player gameplay (which
brings its own problems). I suspect the far easier option is to just ban
RMT.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I had a very short debate with an old friend. We used to debate
economics and politics in high school, despite being at different
schools. Most of these debates took place on the walk from my place to
the nearest TimeZone (an 80’s gaming arcade). The chats were always
friendly, but we rarely agreed. Over 20 years later we met up again, and
our views have shifted somewhat, but we still don’t agree. He emailed me
a long treatise from the web about his point of view. I sent back a
critique. I thought, even hoped, that might be the end of it as I lacked
time to continue a long debate. I needn’t have worried his reply was a
statement of disagreement and some valid points. I replied agreeing we
disagreed on the basic axiomatic points of the argument and largely left
it at that.</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/386/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png" alt="Someone is wrong" title="Someone is wrong" /></a></p>

<p>If a longer reply arrived attempting initiate a full debate I had
planned a slightly different response, basically apologising but
refusing to engage. Not because the debate would be uninteresting. Quite
the opposite - this friend’s viewpoint is quite dissimilar from mine and
not something I come across normally. Not because the argument would
become uncivil. Our conversations never got heated before, I don’t see
why they would this time. It is because I don’t have the mental energy
for a proper discussion.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’m as mentally fast as I used to be. Or perhaps I’m more
realistic about my learning abilities. Previously I seemed able to pick
up new skills, technology or understand systems in a matter of days
without effort and while doing several other things at the same time. Or
at least I believed I could, maybe I was just arrogant. Now, if
attempted under similar conditions, mastering something new takes a
little longer and requires more attention.</p>

<p>However, I do not think my productivity has slipped (yet). As my natural
mental speed slowed it has been compensated by an increase in experience
and focus. I have seen studies suggesting one’s mental faculties are at
their peak in the early 20’s and it is all downhill from there. My peak
productivity was in my early 30’s, and it hasn’t declined much since
then. The difference is that I’m aware of having to concentrate on the
task at hand more intensely and that my memory of previous similar work
situations helps me avoid wrong paths. Or, perhaps I’m still arrogant.</p>

<p>Right now, Concealed Intent is taking up nearly all of my thoughts. I
need all the focus and concentration (and experience) I can muster to
complete it in a reasonable timeframe. Just the initial reply to my
friend’s website took over a work day. Time I can’t afford at the moment - I’m not able to easily split my attention. So I won’t. Debates will
have to wait.</p>

  <h4><a href="/blog/2014/10/bank-transfers.html">Bank Transfer Errors</a></h4> 
  Tags:

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>At least in the UK, it is often best to pay money to people via bank
transfer. This is the process where the payer enters the bank account
number of the payee into some system and then the money is moved
directly from bank account to bank account. It is easy and costs nothing
(in the UK). I used to use it all the time for paying rent and similar
bills.</p>

<p>It is surprising to hear that errors regularly occur in this process.
People type in an incorrect bank account number and so the wrong person
receives the money. Obviously in some distress, the payer contacts the
bank to fix the problem, but the bank doesn’t see it as their problem.
Pushing or getting the media involved often gets the required results
(see
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/30/online-cash-transfer-error">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/mar/18/banks-slow-transferred-cash-wrong-account">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/09/26000-banking-error">here</a>
and many more online stories).</p>

<p>I’m not surprised people type the account number incorrectly; that is
always going to happen. I’m surprised that such an error results in a
valid bank account. If the bank account number included a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a>, then an incorrectly
transcribed number is unlikely to still be valid. Credit cards use a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">checksum algorithm</a> and
this is why when you type one incorrectly the response is “invalid card
number” rather than the wrong account being charged. However, bank
account numbers seem to rarely use this simple error-checking technology
(codes by country are <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18727_01/doc.121/e13483/T359831T498954.htm">listed
here</a>).
Why not? Perhaps when the bank account system was established many
decades ago, checksums were not seem as important. Either because there
was a person (the local bank manager) in the loop to double check the
numbers, or because checksums were too computationally costly
(especially if humans had to do the calculation themselves as computers
weren’t available). Of course now people use the Internet to make
transfers and the whole process is performed by computers without human
interference, and the cost of using checksums is miniscule on even
relatively old processors.</p>

<p>Banks could add checksums now, placing an optional extra character to
the end of bank account numbers (several countries have done this). In
the UK this would be a huge act of customer service. However, from
experience I would doubt the banks interest in serving their customers.
At the moment any errors cost the banks little and changing the system
would be expensive. The core computer programs handling bank accounts
and transfers between them are ancient COBOL programs (at least at the
bank where I worked). Rules like the number of digits in a bank account
are hardcoded and changing them would cascade through various systems.
Testing the change would be a massive task in itself. I can’t imagine
any bank voluntarily undertaking such a project - especially as most
banks are determined to reduced IT costs. Too bad for bank customers.</p>

    <p>After leaving <a href="/blog/2013/06/beacon-technology-part-1.html">Beacon</a> and
finishing the MBA, I jumped on a flight to London in mid 2002. Perth was
too constraining, I didn’t want to do consulting or mining software for
the rest of my career. London seemed like the land of work opportunity.
It would also be easier to travel around the world from a base in
Europe. Both these reasons turned out to be correct, but I forgot the
downsides of London - the expense, the crowds and strangely even the
weather. For a good five years or so the positives outweighed the
negatives, but then the balance shifted. However, upon arrival I was
extremely optimistic.</p>

<p>Crashing in the spare rooms and sofas of old uni friends (the Perth to
London road was well travelled by my age cohort), I started to learn
about the local IT job market. 2002 was the middle of the dot crash
slump. Stories of easy jobs with large pay rates and regular job hopping
abounded, but they always ended with “of course that was before the
crash.” Most of my acquaintances said that contract work was the way to
go - better pay and less bureaucracy, at the expense of career
progression (none of my friends planned to stay long, so that was not an
issue). I aimed for the same, but in the downturn a person with no
record in London couldn’t get through the door for contracting roles - I
was too much of an unknown considering the large number of people
looking for work. After a few months I switched to permanent roles and
started getting interviews again. Lastminute was a notable interview
because the interviewer was so offensive I pledged to never use their
service - a promise I hold to this day, despite being right in their
target market. After 4 months my funds were evaporating quickly and if I
didn’t get one of the two jobs for which I was interviewing then a
return to Perth would be required. <a href="http://www.rbs.co.uk/">RBS</a> was my
preferred option (and I even delayed the other possibility while waiting
for them to decide). However, RBS decided I was “too cold” for a
management position (at least they gave a reason), so I went to work at
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_for_Music">MCPS-PRS Alliance</a>.</p>
