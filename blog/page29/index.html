    <p>I have stopped playing <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a>. I
started taking a look at this influential game several months ago and
kept playing during spare moments. I leave having spent very little in
real money (about £10 over 6 months), but having wasted far too much
precious time. So have my thoughts on the game changed since <a href="/blog/2014/08/eve-online.html?">the
initial impression</a> Not much.</p>

<p>I played just enough EVE each month to cover the subscription fees with
in-game money (buying PLEX for 30 days game time). Although my in-game
income increased with experience, the time available to play only
decreased (with work on Concealed Intent). It was becoming increasingly
hard to reach the PLEX target. In the last month PLEX prices dropped and
I took the extra saved to buy in-game items that increased my per-hour
earnings. I messed up and bought the wrong ones. At this point came the
question “why am I doing this?” Without a good answer I just stopped.</p>

<p>At the moment there is an <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-game-design-mitx-11-126x">Introduction to
Game-Design</a>
course given by the <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu">MIT Game Lab</a> on the
<a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a> website. It aims to teach the basic tools of
game design (namely prototyping, iteration and testing) in a practical
manner. I followed the coursework, finishing with pages of notes and
heard some interesting stories. Unfortunately due to time constraints,
considering the need to finish Concealed Intent, I didn’t participate in
the the practical parts of the course. Still, I would definitely
recommend that people relatively new to game design at least peruse the
videos. The advice proffered includes many of the the lessons I learnt
the hard way. Hopefully further mistakes can be avoided thanks to the
course’s suggestions.</p>

    <p>The series of introductory astronomy courses from
<a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">ANU</a> at <a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a> continues
with <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/violent-universe-anux-anu-astro3x">ANU-ASTRO3x The Violent
Universe</a>,
covering high-energy events and the remnants of stellar explosions. The
structure of the course is exactly the same as <a href="/blog/2014/06/anu-astro1x.html">Part 1 on Great Unsolved
Mysteries</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/09/anu-astro2x.html">Part 2 on
Exoplanets</a>. It is a 9-week course with
about an hour per week of video lectures. There are also mini-tests and
a homework assignment each week with a final exam. The exam is based on
a “mystery” universe nullifying real-world knowledge and forcing the
student to fall back on basic principles. The lectures are almost a
conversational back-and-forth between the presenters <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/pfrancis/">Paul
Francis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schmidt">Brian
Schmidt</a> (with pictures and
notes appearing projected behind them).</p>

<p>The course starts by looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius">Sirius
B</a>. In the 1800’s it was determined
that Sirius (the brightest star in the sky) was wobbling and must be
orbiting another small body with a mass about the same of our Sun. This
led to the discovery of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">white
dwarf</a> stars. These stars are
about as heavy as the Sun, but only as large as the Earth. They also
have a tendency to accrete disks of matter from any larger and less
dense companions. This in turn can result in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_nova">dwarf
novae</a>, where instability in
the accretion disc causes a burst of energy; and, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova">classical
novae</a> when hydrogen from the disc
builds up on the white dwarf, eventually exploding. White dwarves can
also cause the much large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova">type Ia
supernovae</a>, where
enough material accretes on the white dwarf to start carbon fusion and a
runaway thermonuclear explosion. Other types of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">supernovae</a> result from large
stars (much larger than our Sun) reaching the end of their life and
exploding after their core collapses. The remnant of such an event is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron star</a> or maybe even
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black hole</a>.</p>

<p>The difficulty level of these courses only seems to decrease. It is now
so easy I didn’t feel there was any value in spending the time to
complete the assessments - just watching the videos seemed enough. The
lectures still run through the basic maths at the algebraic level (no
calculus), but the assignment is often a multiple choice question or
much simpler maths question.</p>

<p>Entertaining and informative videos, not sure about the value of the
assessment and resulting certification.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>In a burst of enthusiasm for games right before the last Steam Summer
Sale (in June) I played a number of games in my library in an attempt to
increase the played game percentage. Now 15% of my Steam library has
been played (up from 10% beforehand). It would take a lot of time to
clear that backlog! However, in a fit of perversity, most of the games I
played in that burst were games I was unlikely to enjoy - so it didn’t
take too long to decide to abandon them. Anyway, from best to worst,
here are my short reviews from those games.</p>

<p>As before my ranking system falls into 3 broad categories: games I have
finished or want to finish; games I played for a while, but may or may
not play again; and, games I deleted from my spacious hard drive after
an hour or so.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/mark_ninja.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_of_the_Ninja">Mark of the Ninja</a></em>
is stylish 2D side-scroller action game with a stealth mechanic. You are
a ninja investigating an attack upon your dojo. Thus you creep and swing
your way through various buildings avoiding, or if necessary, quietly
disposing of the guards. Guards can detect you via line of sight (so
disabling lights, or going through the ducting is very handy) or noise.
It is very easy to see what is happening and how your actions affect the
guards. Very impressive UI design. Puzzles seem to be logical and combat
is dangerous and to be avoided. The game is also beautiful, done in a
cartoonish style - mainly in black with occasional flashes of bright
colour. I intend to complete this game.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/Dust.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dust:_An_Elysian_Tail">Dust: An Elysian
tale</a></em> is another
pretty hand drawn 2D sidescroller action game, but instead of stealth
the player just fights their way through the huge mass of enemies that
assault them. There is a semblance of story, as the player struggles to
recover their memory as monsters roam the countryside, but it seems
fairly unnecessary. Basically it is fight, fight, fight. And the
fighting is surprisingly fun. The player’s avatar reacts nicely to
commands and feels powerful, with the special actions being particularly
destructive in their devastating effects. My only concern is how quickly
I progressed through the game. While entertaining, none of the battles
were challenging - every fight was won with ease, and I’m not a great
gamer. I stopped about half way through, and am not sure whether I will
return.</p>

    <p>Have you heard of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_costs?">sunken cost
fallacy</a> It is where people
base their decisions on historical costs rather than future benefits. It
is logically incorrect as events or costs incurred previously are in the
past and should not affect people’s next decisions. However, it is very
common.</p>

<p>Right now, I may be falling foul of this fallacy, but I don’t care! I
must finish Concealed Intent!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/work/ConcealedIntent_WIP2_20141117.png"><img src="/assets/posts/work/ConcealedIntent_WIP2_20141117_thumb.png" alt="Concealed Intent WIP" /></a></p>

<p>Work on the game is continuing. It has been just over <a href="/blog/2012/07/concealed-intent.html">2 years of my
life</a> now, and I think it is
finally nearing completion. To that end, I have set a deadline of the
beginning of March next year. That is not a random date, it is when the
<a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer’s Conference</a> is held, which I
will attend. I still think that is an achievable date. Although when I
look at the the screenshot from last week (above) I still see so many
things that have yet to be done. It appears to be an ever expanding list
of todo items, as finishing one task presents many previously
unconsidered tasks! I have heard it said that no game is finished - they
are all just abandoned when “good enough”!</p>

<p>Soon I will be ready for another round of testing. So if you have
previously said you are interested, I hope to contact you, probably in
the new year for some early beta testing (I’ll put you on the <a href="http://eepurl.com/7uj2j">Concealed
Intent mailing list</a>).</p>

<p>As obscurity seems to be the greatest enemy of the indie game developer,
I have also begun to get the good word out on Concealed Intent. There is
a <a href="http://gamasutra.com/blogs/author/CharlesCordingley/992571/">blog at
Gamasutra</a>
and soon other places too. Plus many social media accounts as detailed
below. If you have any other ideas where I should promote the game,
please let me know!</p>
