    <p><a href="/blog/2012/06/blog-stats.html">Two and half years ago</a> this blog
reached 201 posts. Now it has reached 301 posts and it is nearly exactly
7 years old (which makes 43 posts/year). So how has this blog fared over
that time?</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/meta/blog2015.png"><img src="/assets/posts/meta/blog2015.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>There have been over 254,000 visitors, but most don’t stay for very long
and are never seen again. The visitor peak of just under 6000 views in a
month was around the time of the last meta post, June 2012. Since then
there has been a slow decline, back down to around 2000 views/month.</p>

<p>I think this decline corresponds with a change in the content of the
blog. The most popular page is <a href="/blog/2010/08/java-nio-server-example.html">Java NIO server
example</a> and all the other
top 10 posts are also technical in nature. They are also all at least 4
years old (that NIO server post is the most recent). The decrease in
technical posts is due to me leaving my old server-side programming
career and becoming a wannabe indie game developer. Since then I have
posted more about travel, MOOC and games. Apparently these are less
popular topics (at least on this blog).</p>

<p>The decline in viewers has been reflected in a decline in AdSense
revenue. Although I hesitate to call it revenue, because I have never
actually received a penny. The minimum amount for a payout is £60, after
7 years I stand at £46 total. Still a way to go before actually earning
anything. The rate of growth has slowed to around £0.20/month, down from
over a £1/month when views were at a peak.</p>

<p>All the blog posts combined now account for over 160,000 words and 1.1
MB (before formatting). This is a large novel’s worth! Writing the blog
has been worthwhile. Without it, I would barely ever write a word. I
also still have tons of ideas of things to post. So expect more posts to
come (even if few people ever read them).</p>

    <p>A year gone by and it is time again for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game
Jam</a> here in Kuala Lumpur. At thousands of
locations around the world, people got together in small teams to create
a game from scratch in 48 hours. In Malaysia 15 teams totaling around 70
people took part. This included me.</p>

<p>Together with four teammates, we created EAT! (the source and windows
executable can be <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/eat">downloaded
here</a>). A game about deciding
where to eat when everyone wants something different. It is quite
simple. The 4 friends walk down the street and the player presses space
to enter a restaurant as they pass. The happier the friends are with the
food available, the more points and more time you have to play.</p>

    <p><em>There is the theory of the Moebius, a twist in the fabric of space
where time becomes a loop.</em></p>

<p>Wise words from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNb4VKln1uw">Worf</a>.</p>

<p>It seems like I have the same goals every year now. Might as well
embrace it. Without shame I propose my goals for the coming year to be
exactly the <a href="/blog/2014/02/goals-3.html">same as last year</a> (again). At
least it will be an easy cut’n’paste job.</p>

<p>Here are the goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level. I want
to complete the game to at least public beta where it just requires
some fine-tuning and bug-fixing. The aim is to sell the finished
game and at least break even.</li>
  <li>Blog on my personal website at least 3 times a month, but less than
4 times a month. Post at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/">Jarrah
Technology</a> at least once a month.
Also try to be more active on other online media, eg Twitter,
Facebook (which is huge in Malaysia), etc.</li>
  <li>Exercise. No specific target, just try to improve my fitness levels
and continue weightlifting (which I have started in the last year).
Try to stay injury-free.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last year, my results were mixed. Obviously Concealed Intent is not
finished. However, if I can’t get it finished this year I might as well
give up - it is so close. I successfully blogged at the required rate,
I’m beginning to find this quite easy now. At 3 posts/month there is
never a lack of things to write about. Last year I kept up the
weightlifting and the weights keep increasing. Aerobic fitness is
another matter - that needs some attention.</p>

    <p>I have stopped playing <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a>. I
started taking a look at this influential game several months ago and
kept playing during spare moments. I leave having spent very little in
real money (about £10 over 6 months), but having wasted far too much
precious time. So have my thoughts on the game changed since <a href="/blog/2014/08/eve-online.html?">the
initial impression</a> Not much.</p>

<p>I played just enough EVE each month to cover the subscription fees with
in-game money (buying PLEX for 30 days game time). Although my in-game
income increased with experience, the time available to play only
decreased (with work on Concealed Intent). It was becoming increasingly
hard to reach the PLEX target. In the last month PLEX prices dropped and
I took the extra saved to buy in-game items that increased my per-hour
earnings. I messed up and bought the wrong ones. At this point came the
question “why am I doing this?” Without a good answer I just stopped.</p>

<p>At the moment there is an <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-game-design-mitx-11-126x">Introduction to
Game-Design</a>
course given by the <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu">MIT Game Lab</a> on the
<a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a> website. It aims to teach the basic tools of
game design (namely prototyping, iteration and testing) in a practical
manner. I followed the coursework, finishing with pages of notes and
heard some interesting stories. Unfortunately due to time constraints,
considering the need to finish Concealed Intent, I didn’t participate in
the the practical parts of the course. Still, I would definitely
recommend that people relatively new to game design at least peruse the
videos. The advice proffered includes many of the the lessons I learnt
the hard way. Hopefully further mistakes can be avoided thanks to the
course’s suggestions.</p>
