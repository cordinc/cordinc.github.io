  <div class="content">
    <p>A <a href="/blog/2015/02/carcassone-and-agricola.html">previous post</a> mentioned
that I’ve started playing board games. So far my favourite 2-player
board-game is the award winning
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic"><strong>Pandemic</strong></a> (the
game teased in that previous post). This game plays incredibly well with
anywhere from 2 to 4 people, and would probably still work even played
solo. This is because in Pandemic players are not competing against each
other. Instead everyone cooperates as a team against the board game
itself.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_box.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_box.jpg" title="Pandemic Box" width="350" alt="Pandemic Box" /></a></p>

<p>The aim of Pandemic is prevent overwhelming waves of disease spreading
across the globe, and victory is achieved by curing them. If there are
too many disease outbreaks or time runs out, then the game is lost. The
board is a map of major world cities with little coloured cubes to
denote the prevalence of particular diseases. Players take on the role
of various <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a> employees, each with their own
special abilities. Each turn there are various possible actions: move
around the globe; treat disease in the current city; work towards a
cure; and more. At the end of each turn players collect cards from the
“player deck” which can be used to either speed movement or aid cure
research. A card can be used for one or the other, but not both. This
sets up a nice dilemma - use a card to travel quickly to a hot zone or
save it towards a long-term cure. These cards can also be traded between
players, but only if they are both in the appropriate city. This
complicates teamwork, as being spread out helps contain disease quickly,
but being close aids research through card trading. After the player
cards comes the infection stage, when a few cities have the amount of
disease in them increased. If there is too much disease in a city then
an outbreak occurs, spreading to neighboring cities.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_board.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_board.jpg" title="A bad start" width="500" alt="A bad start" /></a></p>

<p>The brilliance of the game comes from its pacing. If the game was
entirely as described above then players could formulate long-term plans
towards cures, and then steadily move forwards with occasional
diversions for threatening situations. Instead, there are epidemics and
a resulting period of panic as everything seems to be going wrong. In
the player deck are between 4 to 6 epidemic cards. The number of such
cards determines the game’s difficulty. When an epidemic card is drawn a
random new city is given the maximum amount of disease. Then that city’s
infection card, and all the previously drawn infection cities and
shuffled and placed back on the top of the infection deck. BACK ON THE
TOP! This means that all the previously infected cities will soon be
infected again, and if they haven’t been treated then there is a good
chance of an outbreak.</p>

<p>This great mechanic brings a little bit of stress to the game. Plans
tend to fall apart once an epidemic occurs. Getting two such cards in
quick succession mean the players will struggle for some time to get
back to a state where they can plan cures. The way the rules suggest
shuffling the cards prevents 3 epidemics in a row - because such an
event would almost certainly mean the end of the game. Each game I’ve
played so far has been a rollercoaster, the careful execution of plans
punctuated by setbacks from epidemics. It is also very well balanced, my
win rate has been around 50% (but getting better as I’m still learning),
but I also haven’t tried the hardest 6-epidemic version yet.</p>

<p>A game takes about 45 minutes to complete, but another 5 minutes to set
up. The production values are high, all the components feel well-made
(out of plastic and cardboard). There are a number of expansion sets,
but I haven’t played them. There are also some alternative “scenarios”
online - essentially alternative rules. I found a couple of official
scenarios while writing this, available
<a href="http://zmangames.com/goodies/Pandemic_Government-Shutdown.pdf">here</a>,
and <a href="http://zmangames.com/goodies/Pandemic_Isolation.pdf">here</a>. I’ll
have to give them a try.</p>

<p>Pandemic is a game that gets so much right. The pacing and balance is
near perfect. The idea of a cooperative board game is new to me, but
works very well. I can highly recommend giving this game a try if you
have the chance.</p>

    <p>This year I went to the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer’s Conference
(GDC)</a>, held every year in San Francisco
(usually sometime in March). I have written about my impression of the
conference
<a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2015/03/15/Know-Thyself/">here</a>. The
short version is it was both inspiring and depressing. So this post is
just a link to some photos and interesting points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 40 years I have never seen anyone defecate on the street. A claim
I can no longer make after a week in San Francisco - I have now seen it
twice. I will definitely stay in a better area of the city next time I
go.</li>
  <li>Apple laptops were everywhere, spotting a PC laptop was quite a rare
occurrence. Surface tablets were about as common as iPads, and Android
phones outnumbered iPhones.</li>
  <li>A couple of speakers espoused taking your own path in indie game
development and being original, but were introduced as having worked on
anodyne AAA games.</li>
  <li>The Valve expo booth screamed “go away”, I think the designer must
have studied some <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/18/defensive-architecture-keeps-poverty-undeen-and-makes-us-more-hostile">defensive
architecture</a>.</li>
  <li>At least 10 expo booths were showing some sort of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">VR</a> equipment or
software.</li>
</ul>

<p>The best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/gdc_15.html">available
here</a>.</p>

    <p>The last fortnight I have been very busy starting the marketing on
Concealed Intent. Sadly (to me) I haven’t had much time to write code.
Far more time has been spent writing words in order to let people know
about the game.</p>

<iframe src="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/widget/394572500" width="336" height="137" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>Just a couple of days ago I put Concealed Intent up on Steam Greenlight.
If you have a Steam account, please go <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=394572500">vote for it
here</a>.
Feel free to have your friends, acquaintances or just passersby vote for
it too.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, Greenlight is the way for Indies to get their
games on Steam, the largest PC/Mac game distribution platform. It is
very important to any PC/Mac game’s success. It can take several months
to get through the Greenlight popularity contest (there is no time
limit), which is why I have started now, some months before completing
the game.</p>

<p>There is also a video trailer of the game in action on the Greenlight
page, or you can see it YouTube below.</p>

    <p>My partner and I enjoy the occasional modern board game. There has been
a renaissance in high quality board games in recent years. If you
haven’t tried any of the new
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game">European-style</a> I
can recommend giving one a try - they are very different to, and much
better than the old Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit style games. However,
there is a problem. Most require more than two players for the best
experience. So the two of us can only play when we convince others to
join us.</p>

<p>As part of a Christmas gift we recently bought three board games that
supposedly work just fine with only two players. The other requirement
was nothing with a fantasy or science-fiction theme. We bought:
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119890/agricola-all-creatures-big-and-small">Agricola: All Creatures Great and
Small</a>;
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>; and,
a third I’ll detail in another post (it is so good it deserves a post
all to itself).</p>

<p><strong>Carcassonne</strong> is a tile placement placement game with a medieval
French theme. Each player takes a random tile (no peeking) from the
remaining pile and places it on the board. The tiles show parts of an
old countryside with roads, cities, fields, rivers and monasteries on
them. When placing a tile, it must share at least one edge with a tile
already on the board, and must continue any features in adjoining tiles.
So roads just can’t stop at the edge of a field. The tiles are built so
that there is nearly always somewhere to put them, it might just be that
none of the available positions help you much. In this way the
countryside constructed should be consistent, although it may look a
little strange (with roads running in loops and awkwardly truncated
cities). The comment at the table was that the French King should sack
the person laying out roads and cities as they were such a mess.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="/blog/2012/06/blog-stats.html">Two and half years ago</a> this blog
reached 201 posts. Now it has reached 301 posts and it is nearly exactly
7 years old (which makes 43 posts/year). So how has this blog fared over
that time?</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/meta/blog2015.png"><img src="/assets/posts/meta/blog2015.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>There have been over 254,000 visitors, but most don’t stay for very long
and are never seen again. The visitor peak of just under 6000 views in a
month was around the time of the last meta post, June 2012. Since then
there has been a slow decline, back down to around 2000 views/month.</p>

<p>I think this decline corresponds with a change in the content of the
blog. The most popular page is <a href="/blog/2010/08/java-nio-server-example.html">Java NIO server
example</a> and all the other
top 10 posts are also technical in nature. They are also all at least 4
years old (that NIO server post is the most recent). The decrease in
technical posts is due to me leaving my old server-side programming
career and becoming a wannabe indie game developer. Since then I have
posted more about travel, MOOC and games. Apparently these are less
popular topics (at least on this blog).</p>

<p>The decline in viewers has been reflected in a decline in AdSense
revenue. Although I hesitate to call it revenue, because I have never
actually received a penny. The minimum amount for a payout is £60, after
7 years I stand at £46 total. Still a way to go before actually earning
anything. The rate of growth has slowed to around £0.20/month, down from
over a £1/month when views were at a peak.</p>

<p>All the blog posts combined now account for over 160,000 words and 1.1
MB (before formatting). This is a large novel’s worth! Writing the blog
has been worthwhile. Without it, I would barely ever write a word. I
also still have tons of ideas of things to post. So expect more posts to
come (even if few people ever read them).</p>
