    <p>The last fortnight I have been very busy starting the marketing on
Concealed Intent. Sadly (to me) I haven’t had much time to write code.
Far more time has been spent writing words in order to let people know
about the game.</p>

<iframe src="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/widget/394572500" width="336" height="137" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>Just a couple of days ago I put Concealed Intent up on Steam Greenlight.
If you have a Steam account, please go <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=394572500">vote for it
here</a>.
Feel free to have your friends, acquaintances or just passersby vote for
it too.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, Greenlight is the way for Indies to get their
games on Steam, the largest PC/Mac game distribution platform. It is
very important to any PC/Mac game’s success. It can take several months
to get through the Greenlight popularity contest (there is no time
limit), which is why I have started now, some months before completing
the game.</p>

<p>There is also a video trailer of the game in action on the Greenlight
page, or you can see it YouTube below.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My partner and I enjoy the occasional modern board game. There has been
a renaissance in high quality board games in recent years. If you
haven’t tried any of the new
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German-style_board_game">European-style</a> I
can recommend giving one a try - they are very different to, and much
better than the old Monopoly or Trivial Pursuit style games. However,
there is a problem. Most require more than two players for the best
experience. So the two of us can only play when we convince others to
join us.</p>

<p>As part of a Christmas gift we recently bought three board games that
supposedly work just fine with only two players. The other requirement
was nothing with a fantasy or science-fiction theme. We bought:
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/119890/agricola-all-creatures-big-and-small">Agricola: All Creatures Great and
Small</a>;
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/822/carcassonne">Carcassonne</a>; and,
a third I’ll detail in another post (it is so good it deserves a post
all to itself).</p>

<p><strong>Carcassonne</strong> is a tile placement placement game with a medieval
French theme. Each player takes a random tile (no peeking) from the
remaining pile and places it on the board. The tiles show parts of an
old countryside with roads, cities, fields, rivers and monasteries on
them. When placing a tile, it must share at least one edge with a tile
already on the board, and must continue any features in adjoining tiles.
So roads just can’t stop at the edge of a field. The tiles are built so
that there is nearly always somewhere to put them, it might just be that
none of the available positions help you much. In this way the
countryside constructed should be consistent, although it may look a
little strange (with roads running in loops and awkwardly truncated
cities). The comment at the table was that the French King should sack
the person laying out roads and cities as they were such a mess.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="/blog/2012/06/blog-stats.html">Two and half years ago</a> this blog
reached 201 posts. Now it has reached 301 posts and it is nearly exactly
7 years old (which makes 43 posts/year). So how has this blog fared over
that time?</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/meta/blog2015.png"><img src="/assets/posts/meta/blog2015.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>There have been over 254,000 visitors, but most don’t stay for very long
and are never seen again. The visitor peak of just under 6000 views in a
month was around the time of the last meta post, June 2012. Since then
there has been a slow decline, back down to around 2000 views/month.</p>

<p>I think this decline corresponds with a change in the content of the
blog. The most popular page is <a href="/blog/2010/08/java-nio-server-example.html">Java NIO server
example</a> and all the other
top 10 posts are also technical in nature. They are also all at least 4
years old (that NIO server post is the most recent). The decrease in
technical posts is due to me leaving my old server-side programming
career and becoming a wannabe indie game developer. Since then I have
posted more about travel, MOOC and games. Apparently these are less
popular topics (at least on this blog).</p>

<p>The decline in viewers has been reflected in a decline in AdSense
revenue. Although I hesitate to call it revenue, because I have never
actually received a penny. The minimum amount for a payout is £60, after
7 years I stand at £46 total. Still a way to go before actually earning
anything. The rate of growth has slowed to around £0.20/month, down from
over a £1/month when views were at a peak.</p>

<p>All the blog posts combined now account for over 160,000 words and 1.1
MB (before formatting). This is a large novel’s worth! Writing the blog
has been worthwhile. Without it, I would barely ever write a word. I
also still have tons of ideas of things to post. So expect more posts to
come (even if few people ever read them).</p>

    <p>A year gone by and it is time again for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game
Jam</a> here in Kuala Lumpur. At thousands of
locations around the world, people got together in small teams to create
a game from scratch in 48 hours. In Malaysia 15 teams totaling around 70
people took part. This included me.</p>

<p>Together with four teammates, we created EAT! (the source and windows
executable can be <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/eat">downloaded
here</a>). A game about deciding
where to eat when everyone wants something different. It is quite
simple. The 4 friends walk down the street and the player presses space
to enter a restaurant as they pass. The happier the friends are with the
food available, the more points and more time you have to play.</p>

    <p><em>There is the theory of the Moebius, a twist in the fabric of space
where time becomes a loop.</em></p>

<p>Wise words from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNb4VKln1uw">Worf</a>.</p>

<p>It seems like I have the same goals every year now. Might as well
embrace it. Without shame I propose my goals for the coming year to be
exactly the <a href="/blog/2014/02/goals-3.html">same as last year</a> (again). At
least it will be an easy cut’n’paste job.</p>

<p>Here are the goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level. I want
to complete the game to at least public beta where it just requires
some fine-tuning and bug-fixing. The aim is to sell the finished
game and at least break even.</li>
  <li>Blog on my personal website at least 3 times a month, but less than
4 times a month. Post at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/">Jarrah
Technology</a> at least once a month.
Also try to be more active on other online media, eg Twitter,
Facebook (which is huge in Malaysia), etc.</li>
  <li>Exercise. No specific target, just try to improve my fitness levels
and continue weightlifting (which I have started in the last year).
Try to stay injury-free.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last year, my results were mixed. Obviously Concealed Intent is not
finished. However, if I can’t get it finished this year I might as well
give up - it is so close. I successfully blogged at the required rate,
I’m beginning to find this quite easy now. At 3 posts/month there is
never a lack of things to write about. Last year I kept up the
weightlifting and the weights keep increasing. Aerobic fitness is
another matter - that needs some attention.</p>
