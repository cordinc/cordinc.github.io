and on its blog, <a href="http://www.revolutionspodcast.com">Revolutions

<p>Some time ago I finished the excellent and long-running history podcast
“The History of Rome” (detailed in blog posts
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/history-of-rome.html">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/06/history-of-rome-again.html">here</a>).
Now Mike Duncan is back with another extended podcast series, this time
on various revolutions. After 83 episodes, the series has covered the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War">English Revolution</a>,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">American
Revolution</a> and is
currently working through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution">French
Revolution</a>. Apparently
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution">Haitian
Revolution</a> will also
be detailed in future, but after that it is uncertain how much farther
it will go. As before, this series is well produced and Mike is an
excellent and interesting speaker. Each episode is around 25 minutes in
length (audio only) telling the history in chronological order.
Occasional supplemental episodes detail side stories or biographies not
directly related to the current episode, but germane to the revolution
as a whole.</p>

<p>So far I have listened to the 20 episodes on the English Revolution (not
counting the introduction on what defines a revolution). Knowing the
major events did not detract from the intriguing story. In 1642 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England">Charles
I</a> called a
parliament to raise taxes to suppress a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops%27_Wars">Scottish
rebellion</a> over his
attempts to enforce changes in religious dogma. At the time parliament
consisted solely of members of the English aristocracy and held legal
responsibility for creating and raising taxes. Safe to say the
parliamentary session did not go well. One of the Kings supporter’s
Stafford was executed after guilt by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder">Bill of
Attainder</a> (where
parliament declares you guilty without a trial, it still exists in the
UK, but hasn’t been used sine 1782!). It ended with the King attempting
and failing to arrest 5 parliamentarians. Then both sides (King and
parliament) started raising armies. Mike suggests the war’s length was
extended by infighting on each side and the inexperience of their
soldiers (at least until the rise of a professional parliamentary army).
Eventually the King was captured, and after some more fighting,
executed. Britain became a republic under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell">Oliver
Cromwell</a>, but differences
over what that meant continued until his death, with a much weaker
monarchy restored soon afterwards under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell">Charles
II</a>.</p>

<p>The very legalistic nature of the conflict greatly surprised me. The
action took place as much in parliament as it did on the battlefield.
Each side took pains to justify their actions under existing or newly
created laws, albeit sometime only by greatly stretching their meaning.
The conflict often involved forcibly removing the unsupportive or adding
supportive members to parliament so that a particular law could be
passed. Once the King was captured there also seems to have been great
effort involved by nearly all sides in trying to keep him the King, but
with great disagreement under what conditions. After a short second war
when Charles I attempted to take advantage of the disunity by having the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_English_Civil_War">Scottish invade</a>
(unfortunately for him, unsuccessfully). The army <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride%27s_Purge">purged
parliament</a> of all those
opposing it (essentialy a coup), allowing a successful treason trial
against the King.</p>

<p>The revolution is also notable in that certain radical views became
relatively commonplace for a while. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers">Levellers</a> believed in
religious tolerance, universal male suffrage (rather than just for the
wealthy) and legal equality for all. While their views were unthinkable
at the start of the war, by the end they nearly managed to write the
English Constitution (which was ultimately never written). I have a
feeling they will come up again in the podcasts on the American
Revolution. There were also the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggers">Diggers</a> a group who took the
Leveller manifesto and extended it to economic equality - becoming
something like Christian communists.</p>

<p>Very entertaining. This series is highly recommended.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A recent Facebook post by a friend of mine got me thinking. He and I
often end up in the same irregular RPG group playing <a href="http://www.modiphius.com/achtung-cthulhu.html">Achtung
Cthulhu!</a> or <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com">Apocalypse
World</a> or whatever else people feel like at
the time. In this posting he referenced someone else’s blog telling the
story of how they developed the background story to a RPG character over
time, rather than the traditional all at the start. My friend thought
this was a good idea and something he preferred to do as well. This got
me thinking about how games could handle a continuously developed player
character backstory.</p>

<p>Most games I’ve played place very little importance on your character’s
backstory. Traditionally some backstory is told at start and is then
ignored or has little impact on the game. Some games force backstory on
characters in the form of connections to other characters. Perhaps some
tabletop GMs enforce backstory, and I’ve seen people play to their
character’s history - but mostly it just seems to be a set of
guidelines. Very rarely (as in the blog post that started this train of
thought) a character’s story from before the game started is developed
as the game continues (games where the player has lost their memory and
is slowly regaining it are a notable, but cliched, exception). Many
games build constructing a backstory into the mechanics of character
creation - what better way to explain the character’s abilities.
Although this involves some early investment in a character - I have
seen make certain players uncomfortable (like my friend). Humorously, it
was possible to die during character creation in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)">Traveller</a> - so much for that investment of time and emotion!</p>

<p>By developing the backstory as you play the game it is easier to fit
your backstory to the way story turns out. The GM/computer can adjust
game to fit the emerging backstory. Perhaps new adventures can be
created riffing of new aspects to the characters’ story. Also the
history is built up as as the player becomes more comfortable with the
character. It might even increase player involvement as they see the
history increase and want to keep it going. There are a few problems too
of course. The longer the game continues, the harder it will be to find
suitable things to add to the backstory, especially for characters that
start in an inexperienced state. Also, it may lead to contradictions if
the player/GM if not careful and a new bit of backstory doesn’t match a
previously played part of the game. The ongoing backstory idea could
also be extended to become part of the game itself. Perhaps flashbacks
could be used to highlight a part of the player’s past. Or, the game
could progress inside-out like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Weapons">The Use of
Weapons</a> where the story
starts in the middle of the narrative and progresses forwards and
backwards in alternating chapters.</p>

<p>Another way to use the continuing backstory idea would be to include it
in experience/advancement systems of a RPG (tabletop or computer). This
would fix it into the structure of the game.</p>

<p>A hallmark of almost all RPGs of some form is character advancement.
There are a few I can think of that don’t use this mechanic -
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiasco_(role-playing_game)">Fiasco</a> for
example. However, for the vast majority of players (especially in
computer RPGs) improving the abilities of your character over the course
of many adventures is very important. There are various drivers for this
advancement mechanic in different games. It can be finishing a
quest/scenario, performing a particularly notable action (or failing an
action!), or just the old default of killing things (hopefully
monsters:).</p>

<p>One idea to combine these two concepts is to have the reward for
advancement being writing a sentence or two of backstory that impacts
the character’s abilities. It could be that the whole ability or skill
system is replaced by sentences of story. If particular skills are still
required or noteworthy then they could be used or underlined in these
sentences. For example, “Katniss often provided for her family by <span class="underline">hunting</span> for food in the woods near her home,
becoming proficient in use of the <span class="underline">bow</span>”.
Here, <span class="underline">bow</span> and <span class="underline">hunting</span> are skills. How the skills translate
into gameplay depends on how the game should work. For more story
oriented games then the player could justify their actions with
reference to their backstory. More numerical rules oriented games could
perhaps assign a value to each mention of a keyword with adjectives
acting as modifiers. Really “crunchy” rules based games probably
wouldn’t work well with this system. When ready to advance the player
could, for instance, come up with a sentence related to their current
situation and a sentence related to their past. These would have to be
agreed with the GM (particularly with respect to the number of keywords
and adjectives if they are important).</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Funding Circle.html">Funding Circle</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A year on from <a href="/blog/2014/04/funding-circle-again.html">my last report</a>
and <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding Circle</a> (a peer-to-peer
lending website in the UK) is still going strong. It is approaching
nearly £600 million in funded loans. Whenever I check there is usually
50 or more loans available. It has been sometime since I saw a loan fail
to reach its funding minimum. The company has also expanded to property
development loans, albeit at a fixed rate rather than the normal auction
system (with first charge on the property).</p>

<p>So has the continued success of the company translated into improved
returns for the customers/investors? You may remember two year ago my
annual return (~2) was barely better than a bank deposit - largely due
to a rash of bankruptcies. Last year was better, the return was a
respectable 4.1 as recoveries picked up significantly. This year the
result is:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.3%<br />
After Fees: 7.3%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 6.3%</p>

<p>I consider that a very good return. It is roughly equivalent to the
return on the UK stock market
(<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EFTSE">FTSE-100</a>) over the same
time period. The gross and after fees returns are roughly consistent
with last year, and recoveries were down a little. The difference in
return is down to bad debt more than halving.</p>

<p>Over all this time my investment system has not changed, no extra money
has been invested (but all profits reinvested). I only bid on loans
under 24 months, from profitable firms that are paying tax at the
expected rate and have positive working capital. People have asked about
the “paying tax filter” - these loans are to small companies unlikely to
have access to the tax minimisation systems heard about in the press.
Thus a company showing an accounting profit that is not paying roughly
the expected tax on that profit (given various UK tax breaks -
historical losses or research costs for example) should be a warning
sign there may be something strange going on in the accounts. I don’t
have the time to dig deeper into such firms - they are just cut at this
stage.</p>

<p>So if I haven’t changed anything, why has bad debt dropped? I’m not
sure. My bad debt rate is now about average compared to all investors.
It could be better risk management by Funding Circle, or just a more
favourable UK business environment. According to their <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/statistics">statistics
page</a>, bad debt on Funding
Circle loans made in the last couple of years has trended below
expectations. However, bad debt in loans made during the first two years
(2010-11), when I was an early adopter, have been much greater than
expected. This explains why my annualised return since joining the site
is 5.1% compared to the average of 5.7% for equivalent investors.</p>

<p>Decisions should be made on future benefits not historical costs. On
that basis I’m considering adding a little extra money to the capital.
There are a few concerning issues with the UK economy and I believe the
possibility of returning to the “bad years” is non-trivial. However, if
the return from Funding Circle is around 2% in the bad years, then it
seems a reasonable risk to take. I hope.</p>

    <p>A couple of numerically notable birthdays fell at the end of last year
and at the beginning of this year. To celebrate we made short weekend
trips to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langkawi">Langkawi</a> (November
2014) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok">Bangkok</a> (April 2015).
Neither holiday was particularly energetic, our main goal was relaxation
and eating. So I can’t say much about the tourist sites of either
destination, but I can say they are nice places to hang out.</p>
