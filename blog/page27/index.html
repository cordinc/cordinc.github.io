  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A recent Facebook post by a friend of mine got me thinking. He and I
often end up in the same irregular RPG group playing <a href="http://www.modiphius.com/achtung-cthulhu.html">Achtung
Cthulhu!</a> or <a href="http://apocalypse-world.com">Apocalypse
World</a> or whatever else people feel like at
the time. In this posting he referenced someone else’s blog telling the
story of how they developed the background story to a RPG character over
time, rather than the traditional all at the start. My friend thought
this was a good idea and something he preferred to do as well. This got
me thinking about how games could handle a continuously developed player
character backstory.</p>

<p>Most games I’ve played place very little importance on your character’s
backstory. Traditionally some backstory is told at start and is then
ignored or has little impact on the game. Some games force backstory on
characters in the form of connections to other characters. Perhaps some
tabletop GMs enforce backstory, and I’ve seen people play to their
character’s history - but mostly it just seems to be a set of
guidelines. Very rarely (as in the blog post that started this train of
thought) a character’s story from before the game started is developed
as the game continues (games where the player has lost their memory and
is slowly regaining it are a notable, but cliched, exception). Many
games build constructing a backstory into the mechanics of character
creation - what better way to explain the character’s abilities.
Although this involves some early investment in a character - I have
seen make certain players uncomfortable (like my friend). Humorously, it
was possible to die during character creation in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traveller_(role-playing_game)">Traveller</a> - so much for that investment of time and emotion!</p>

<p>By developing the backstory as you play the game it is easier to fit
your backstory to the way story turns out. The GM/computer can adjust
game to fit the emerging backstory. Perhaps new adventures can be
created riffing of new aspects to the characters’ story. Also the
history is built up as as the player becomes more comfortable with the
character. It might even increase player involvement as they see the
history increase and want to keep it going. There are a few problems too
of course. The longer the game continues, the harder it will be to find
suitable things to add to the backstory, especially for characters that
start in an inexperienced state. Also, it may lead to contradictions if
the player/GM if not careful and a new bit of backstory doesn’t match a
previously played part of the game. The ongoing backstory idea could
also be extended to become part of the game itself. Perhaps flashbacks
could be used to highlight a part of the player’s past. Or, the game
could progress inside-out like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_of_Weapons">The Use of
Weapons</a> where the story
starts in the middle of the narrative and progresses forwards and
backwards in alternating chapters.</p>

<p>Another way to use the continuing backstory idea would be to include it
in experience/advancement systems of a RPG (tabletop or computer). This
would fix it into the structure of the game.</p>

<p>A hallmark of almost all RPGs of some form is character advancement.
There are a few I can think of that don’t use this mechanic -
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiasco_(role-playing_game)">Fiasco</a> for
example. However, for the vast majority of players (especially in
computer RPGs) improving the abilities of your character over the course
of many adventures is very important. There are various drivers for this
advancement mechanic in different games. It can be finishing a
quest/scenario, performing a particularly notable action (or failing an
action!), or just the old default of killing things (hopefully
monsters:).</p>

<p>One idea to combine these two concepts is to have the reward for
advancement being writing a sentence or two of backstory that impacts
the character’s abilities. It could be that the whole ability or skill
system is replaced by sentences of story. If particular skills are still
required or noteworthy then they could be used or underlined in these
sentences. For example, “Katniss often provided for her family by <span class="underline">hunting</span> for food in the woods near her home,
becoming proficient in use of the <span class="underline">bow</span>”.
Here, <span class="underline">bow</span> and <span class="underline">hunting</span> are skills. How the skills translate
into gameplay depends on how the game should work. For more story
oriented games then the player could justify their actions with
reference to their backstory. More numerical rules oriented games could
perhaps assign a value to each mention of a keyword with adjectives
acting as modifiers. Really “crunchy” rules based games probably
wouldn’t work well with this system. When ready to advance the player
could, for instance, come up with a sentence related to their current
situation and a sentence related to their past. These would have to be
agreed with the GM (particularly with respect to the number of keywords
and adjectives if they are important).</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Funding Circle.html">Funding Circle</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A year on from <a href="/blog/2014/04/funding-circle-again.html">my last report</a>
and <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding Circle</a> (a peer-to-peer
lending website in the UK) is still going strong. It is approaching
nearly £600 million in funded loans. Whenever I check there is usually
50 or more loans available. It has been sometime since I saw a loan fail
to reach its funding minimum. The company has also expanded to property
development loans, albeit at a fixed rate rather than the normal auction
system (with first charge on the property).</p>

<p>So has the continued success of the company translated into improved
returns for the customers/investors? You may remember two year ago my
annual return (~2) was barely better than a bank deposit - largely due
to a rash of bankruptcies. Last year was better, the return was a
respectable 4.1 as recoveries picked up significantly. This year the
result is:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.3%<br />
After Fees: 7.3%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 6.3%</p>

<p>I consider that a very good return. It is roughly equivalent to the
return on the UK stock market
(<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EFTSE">FTSE-100</a>) over the same
time period. The gross and after fees returns are roughly consistent
with last year, and recoveries were down a little. The difference in
return is down to bad debt more than halving.</p>

<p>Over all this time my investment system has not changed, no extra money
has been invested (but all profits reinvested). I only bid on loans
under 24 months, from profitable firms that are paying tax at the
expected rate and have positive working capital. People have asked about
the “paying tax filter” - these loans are to small companies unlikely to
have access to the tax minimisation systems heard about in the press.
Thus a company showing an accounting profit that is not paying roughly
the expected tax on that profit (given various UK tax breaks -
historical losses or research costs for example) should be a warning
sign there may be something strange going on in the accounts. I don’t
have the time to dig deeper into such firms - they are just cut at this
stage.</p>

<p>So if I haven’t changed anything, why has bad debt dropped? I’m not
sure. My bad debt rate is now about average compared to all investors.
It could be better risk management by Funding Circle, or just a more
favourable UK business environment. According to their <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/statistics">statistics
page</a>, bad debt on Funding
Circle loans made in the last couple of years has trended below
expectations. However, bad debt in loans made during the first two years
(2010-11), when I was an early adopter, have been much greater than
expected. This explains why my annualised return since joining the site
is 5.1% compared to the average of 5.7% for equivalent investors.</p>

<p>Decisions should be made on future benefits not historical costs. On
that basis I’m considering adding a little extra money to the capital.
There are a few concerning issues with the UK economy and I believe the
possibility of returning to the “bad years” is non-trivial. However, if
the return from Funding Circle is around 2% in the bad years, then it
seems a reasonable risk to take. I hope.</p>

    <p>A couple of numerically notable birthdays fell at the end of last year
and at the beginning of this year. To celebrate we made short weekend
trips to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langkawi">Langkawi</a> (November
2014) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok">Bangkok</a> (April 2015).
Neither holiday was particularly energetic, our main goal was relaxation
and eating. So I can’t say much about the tourist sites of either
destination, but I can say they are nice places to hang out.</p>

<p>The best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/birthdays_15.html">available

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A <a href="/blog/2015/02/carcassone-and-agricola.html">previous post</a> mentioned
that I’ve started playing board games. So far my favourite 2-player
board-game is the award winning
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic"><strong>Pandemic</strong></a> (the
game teased in that previous post). This game plays incredibly well with
anywhere from 2 to 4 people, and would probably still work even played
solo. This is because in Pandemic players are not competing against each
other. Instead everyone cooperates as a team against the board game
itself.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_box.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_box.jpg" title="Pandemic Box" width="350" alt="Pandemic Box" /></a></p>

<p>The aim of Pandemic is prevent overwhelming waves of disease spreading
across the globe, and victory is achieved by curing them. If there are
too many disease outbreaks or time runs out, then the game is lost. The
board is a map of major world cities with little coloured cubes to
denote the prevalence of particular diseases. Players take on the role
of various <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a> employees, each with their own
special abilities. Each turn there are various possible actions: move
around the globe; treat disease in the current city; work towards a
cure; and more. At the end of each turn players collect cards from the
“player deck” which can be used to either speed movement or aid cure
research. A card can be used for one or the other, but not both. This
sets up a nice dilemma - use a card to travel quickly to a hot zone or
save it towards a long-term cure. These cards can also be traded between
players, but only if they are both in the appropriate city. This
complicates teamwork, as being spread out helps contain disease quickly,
but being close aids research through card trading. After the player
cards comes the infection stage, when a few cities have the amount of
disease in them increased. If there is too much disease in a city then
an outbreak occurs, spreading to neighboring cities.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_board.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_board.jpg" title="A bad start" width="500" alt="A bad start" /></a></p>

<p>The brilliance of the game comes from its pacing. If the game was
entirely as described above then players could formulate long-term plans
towards cures, and then steadily move forwards with occasional
diversions for threatening situations. Instead, there are epidemics and
a resulting period of panic as everything seems to be going wrong. In
the player deck are between 4 to 6 epidemic cards. The number of such
cards determines the game’s difficulty. When an epidemic card is drawn a
random new city is given the maximum amount of disease. Then that city’s
infection card, and all the previously drawn infection cities and
shuffled and placed back on the top of the infection deck. BACK ON THE
TOP! This means that all the previously infected cities will soon be
infected again, and if they haven’t been treated then there is a good
chance of an outbreak.</p>

<p>This great mechanic brings a little bit of stress to the game. Plans
tend to fall apart once an epidemic occurs. Getting two such cards in
quick succession mean the players will struggle for some time to get
back to a state where they can plan cures. The way the rules suggest
shuffling the cards prevents 3 epidemics in a row - because such an
event would almost certainly mean the end of the game. Each game I’ve
played so far has been a rollercoaster, the careful execution of plans
punctuated by setbacks from epidemics. It is also very well balanced, my
win rate has been around 50% (but getting better as I’m still learning),
but I also haven’t tried the hardest 6-epidemic version yet.</p>

<p>A game takes about 45 minutes to complete, but another 5 minutes to set
up. The production values are high, all the components feel well-made
(out of plastic and cardboard). There are a number of expansion sets,
but I haven’t played them. There are also some alternative “scenarios”
online - essentially alternative rules. I found a couple of official
scenarios while writing this, available
<a href="http://zmangames.com/goodies/Pandemic_Government-Shutdown.pdf">here</a>,
and <a href="http://zmangames.com/goodies/Pandemic_Isolation.pdf">here</a>. I’ll
have to give them a try.</p>

<p>Pandemic is a game that gets so much right. The pacing and balance is
near perfect. The idea of a cooperative board game is new to me, but
works very well. I can highly recommend giving this game a try if you
have the chance.</p>

    <p>This year I went to the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer’s Conference
(GDC)</a>, held every year in San Francisco
(usually sometime in March). I have written about my impression of the
conference
<a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2015/03/15/Know-Thyself/">here</a>. The
short version is it was both inspiring and depressing. So this post is
just a link to some photos and interesting points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 40 years I have never seen anyone defecate on the street. A claim
I can no longer make after a week in San Francisco - I have now seen it
twice. I will definitely stay in a better area of the city next time I
go.</li>
  <li>Apple laptops were everywhere, spotting a PC laptop was quite a rare
occurrence. Surface tablets were about as common as iPads, and Android
phones outnumbered iPhones.</li>
  <li>A couple of speakers espoused taking your own path in indie game
development and being original, but were introduced as having worked on
anodyne AAA games.</li>
  <li>The Valve expo booth screamed “go away”, I think the designer must
have studied some <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/18/defensive-architecture-keeps-poverty-undeen-and-makes-us-more-hostile">defensive
architecture</a>.</li>
  <li>At least 10 expo booths were showing some sort of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">VR</a> equipment or
software.</li>
