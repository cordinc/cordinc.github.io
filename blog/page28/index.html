    <p>A year gone by and it is time again for <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game
Jam</a> here in Kuala Lumpur. At thousands of
locations around the world, people got together in small teams to create
a game from scratch in 48 hours. In Malaysia 15 teams totaling around 70
people took part. This included me.</p>

<p>Together with four teammates, we created EAT! (the source and windows
executable can be <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2015/games/eat">downloaded
here</a>). A game about deciding
where to eat when everyone wants something different. It is quite
simple. The 4 friends walk down the street and the player presses space
to enter a restaurant as they pass. The happier the friends are with the
food available, the more points and more time you have to play.</p>

    <p><em>There is the theory of the Moebius, a twist in the fabric of space
where time becomes a loop.</em></p>

<p>Wise words from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNb4VKln1uw">Worf</a>.</p>

<p>It seems like I have the same goals every year now. Might as well
embrace it. Without shame I propose my goals for the coming year to be
exactly the <a href="/blog/2014/02/goals-3.html">same as last year</a> (again). At
least it will be an easy cut’n’paste job.</p>

<p>Here are the goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Finish or nearly finish Concealed Intent to a saleable level. I want
to complete the game to at least public beta where it just requires
some fine-tuning and bug-fixing. The aim is to sell the finished
game and at least break even.</li>
  <li>Blog on my personal website at least 3 times a month, but less than
4 times a month. Post at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/">Jarrah
Technology</a> at least once a month.
Also try to be more active on other online media, eg Twitter,
Facebook (which is huge in Malaysia), etc.</li>
  <li>Exercise. No specific target, just try to improve my fitness levels
and continue weightlifting (which I have started in the last year).
Try to stay injury-free.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last year, my results were mixed. Obviously Concealed Intent is not
finished. However, if I can’t get it finished this year I might as well
give up - it is so close. I successfully blogged at the required rate,
I’m beginning to find this quite easy now. At 3 posts/month there is
never a lack of things to write about. Last year I kept up the
weightlifting and the weights keep increasing. Aerobic fitness is
another matter - that needs some attention.</p>

    <p>I have stopped playing <a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a>. I
started taking a look at this influential game several months ago and
kept playing during spare moments. I leave having spent very little in
real money (about £10 over 6 months), but having wasted far too much
precious time. So have my thoughts on the game changed since <a href="/blog/2014/08/eve-online.html?">the
initial impression</a> Not much.</p>

<p>I played just enough EVE each month to cover the subscription fees with
in-game money (buying PLEX for 30 days game time). Although my in-game
income increased with experience, the time available to play only
decreased (with work on Concealed Intent). It was becoming increasingly
hard to reach the PLEX target. In the last month PLEX prices dropped and
I took the extra saved to buy in-game items that increased my per-hour
earnings. I messed up and bought the wrong ones. At this point came the
question “why am I doing this?” Without a good answer I just stopped.</p>

<p>At the moment there is an <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-game-design-mitx-11-126x">Introduction to
Game-Design</a>
course given by the <a href="http://gamelab.mit.edu">MIT Game Lab</a> on the
<a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a> website. It aims to teach the basic tools of
game design (namely prototyping, iteration and testing) in a practical
manner. I followed the coursework, finishing with pages of notes and
heard some interesting stories. Unfortunately due to time constraints,
considering the need to finish Concealed Intent, I didn’t participate in
the the practical parts of the course. Still, I would definitely
recommend that people relatively new to game design at least peruse the
videos. The advice proffered includes many of the the lessons I learnt
the hard way. Hopefully further mistakes can be avoided thanks to the
course’s suggestions.</p>

    <p>The series of introductory astronomy courses from
<a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">ANU</a> at <a href="https://www.edx.org">EdX</a> continues
with <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/violent-universe-anux-anu-astro3x">ANU-ASTRO3x The Violent
Universe</a>,
covering high-energy events and the remnants of stellar explosions. The
structure of the course is exactly the same as <a href="/blog/2014/06/anu-astro1x.html">Part 1 on Great Unsolved
Mysteries</a> and <a href="/blog/2014/09/anu-astro2x.html">Part 2 on
Exoplanets</a>. It is a 9-week course with
about an hour per week of video lectures. There are also mini-tests and
a homework assignment each week with a final exam. The exam is based on
a “mystery” universe nullifying real-world knowledge and forcing the
student to fall back on basic principles. The lectures are almost a
conversational back-and-forth between the presenters <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/pfrancis/">Paul
Francis</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schmidt">Brian
Schmidt</a> (with pictures and
notes appearing projected behind them).</p>

<p>The course starts by looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius">Sirius
B</a>. In the 1800’s it was determined
that Sirius (the brightest star in the sky) was wobbling and must be
orbiting another small body with a mass about the same of our Sun. This
led to the discovery of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">white
dwarf</a> stars. These stars are
about as heavy as the Sun, but only as large as the Earth. They also
have a tendency to accrete disks of matter from any larger and less
dense companions. This in turn can result in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_nova">dwarf
novae</a>, where instability in
the accretion disc causes a burst of energy; and, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nova">classical
novae</a> when hydrogen from the disc
builds up on the white dwarf, eventually exploding. White dwarves can
also cause the much large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_Ia_supernova">type Ia
supernovae</a>, where
enough material accretes on the white dwarf to start carbon fusion and a
runaway thermonuclear explosion. Other types of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supernova">supernovae</a> result from large
stars (much larger than our Sun) reaching the end of their life and
exploding after their core collapses. The remnant of such an event is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron star</a> or maybe even
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black hole</a>.</p>

<p>The difficulty level of these courses only seems to decrease. It is now
so easy I didn’t feel there was any value in spending the time to
complete the assessments - just watching the videos seemed enough. The
lectures still run through the basic maths at the algebraic level (no
calculus), but the assignment is often a multiple choice question or
much simpler maths question.</p>

<p>Entertaining and informative videos, not sure about the value of the
assessment and resulting certification.</p>
