  <div class="content">
    <p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/dan-carlins-hardcore-history/id173001861">iTunes</a>
and from <a href="http://www.dancarlin.com/hardcore-history-series/">its own
site</a>, this 5-part
series is a free subset of a larger set of history podcasts. Having only
listened to the 5 Mongol episodes, I can’t talk to the larger sequence.</p>

<p>At first glance of the name and promotional images, Wrath of the Khans -
Hardcore History, seems like it might be a podcast playing up the more
sensationalist parts of history. Luckily this is not the case. I imagine
the presentation aims to bring in as many listeners as possible to an
otherwise serious history series. Written and presented by the
professional broadcaster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Carlin">Dan
Carlin</a>, these 5 well produced
episodes (totaling 8.5 hours) address the history of the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire">Mongol
Empire</a> in the 1200’s.
Starting with the later exploits of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan">Genghis
Khan</a> and ending with
breakup of the empire at the hands of his great-grandchildren.</p>

<p>The podcast starts with a long introduction on how people view history
differently depending on how much empathy they feel for the people at
the time. In a well reasoned argument Dan suggests that the further we
get from events, the more disassociated we become and the easier it is
to reassess aspects of historical events without reference to the
suffering people experienced at the time. Thus it is hard to talk about
the Nazis without reference to their attempts at genocide. However,
Romans can be discussed without mentioning the devastation visited upon
the people they conquered (possibly genocidal in a few instances). The
Mongols seem to fall at the boundary of this change. In the west, the
Mongols seem quite distant. Although Dan recounts the story of his
Chinese university history lecturer admonishing him for failing to
consider the damage done to civilians in creating a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Mongolica">Pax
Mongolica</a>. Interesting
stuff, but perhaps an aside based on the author’s interests rather than
something integral to the story of the Mongols. Other than the fact they
killed an absolutely amazingly huge number of people. Comparable in
numbers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_by_death_toll">death toll from World War
2</a>, despite
the Mongol Empire forming in a time when the world population was much
lower and the methods of killing much more primitive. The Mongols of
Genghis Khan come across as quite a ruthless and expansionary people.
Dan Carlin suggests they saw all non-steppe people as subhuman. He also
points out that civilian atrocities in war had occurred many times
before (and since). The Mongols were exceptional only in scale.</p>

<p>The Mongol Empire starts with Genghis Khan uniting the tribes of the
eastern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppe">steppe</a> for the first
time. Previous steppe tribes had often harassed or conquered nearby
lands. In the west we talk about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthia">Parthians</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scythians">Scythians</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goths">Goths</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huns">Huns</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuq_dynasty">Turks</a> and others. In
Asia there is a similar list of other nomadic tribes - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">Great Wall
of China</a> was built
to try and keep them out. The Mongols were similar to earlier tribes in
that their armies were fast (consisting nearly entirely of light
cavalry), could live of the the land, and well-trained (steppe people
were taught to ride and fight from childhood). They differed from
earlier invasions as their armies were larger (drawing from many
tribes), well disciplined (the penalty for minor infractions was death,
the penalty for major infractions was death for you and your entire
unit), and well led. Genghis Khan is said to have a large network of
spies providing intelligence on his enemies. There are also many stories
of Mongol armies <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Kalka_River">refusing battle until the battleground better suited
them</a>. They
were able to adapt their tactics to changing circumstances. The Mongols
learned siegecraft, successfully besieging many cities, and it is
believed they were the first to bring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Mohi">gunpowder weapons to
Europe</a>, after learning of
them from the Chinese.</p>

<p>In the 13th century the Mongols probably had the most powerful army in
existence, and they used it regularly. In under a century they conquered
multiple kingdoms with relative ease to create the largest empire by
land area in history. They conquered two of the three Chinese kingdoms
at the time (the third was defeated a few years later by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan">Kublai
Khan</a> after the breakup of
the empire). They subdued the previously expansionary Central Asian and
Middle Eastern Sultanates all the way to the Mediterranean. An invasion
into Europe reached as far as Hungary. Apparently the Mongols had an 18
year plan to conquer Europe all the way to the Atlantic (they already
had spies in place). However just a few years into the plan, the Mongol
leader Ogedei Khan (Genghis’ son) died and the army had to return to
Mongolia for a new Khan’s election. It is an intriguing counterfactual
to consider events if Ogedei lived another decade, so the invasion of
Europe could continue. Europe was relatively weak and divided at the
time. It is hard to imagine there would have been more resistance than
in the east.</p>

<p>While the empire stayed united under a single Khan (Genghis, followed by
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogedei_Khan">Ogedei</a>, then Genghis’
grandsons), they suffered no serious military setbacks. The end of the
Empire came from internal divisions - the method of succession used by
the Mongols seems to have been a great cause of internal friction.
Although the transition from Genghis to Ogedei was smooth (as Genghis
made his wishes clear in advance), all the others were contentious.
Mongols used an elective monarchy - at the death of the previous Khan
all the relevant nobles convened to elect a new Khan. I can imagine this
worked well at the tribal level when all the possible leaders spent most
of their time close together. It doesn’t work so well for a continent
spanning empire. Take a look at a map - Hungary to Mongolia is a very
long way! After Ogedei, it took 5 years to elect a new Khan, as one of
the electors refused to attend, believing that the likely new Khan would
order his death. When the expected Khan,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyuk_Khan">Guyuk</a>, finally took command
he died soon after, leading to another 3 year span without a Khan.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongke_Khan">Mongke Khan</a> stabilised the
Empire for a while and even expanded a little, but at his death in 1259
the Mongol Empire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_the_Mongol_Empire">split into four separate
parts</a>.
Thus ending this podcast series, but not the end of the Mongols. The
descendants of Genghis ruled much of Asia for centuries thereafter.</p>

<p>I could much more to write about this excellent podcast on an
interesting part of history (and a largely unknown to me). However, this
post is already long enough. Well worth a download and listen.</p>

    <p>Wow, nearly 3 months since my last post. That regular blogging <a href="/blog/2015/01/goals-4.html">yearly
goal</a> will definitely not be met. Although
the reason for the gap is all the work being put into meeting another of
those goals - completing <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games">Concealed
Intent</a>. Today marks a huge step
towards that goal - the ability to purchase Concealed Intent through
Steam Early Access. For those not familiar with Early Access, it is for
games that are not quite finished, but are playable, and which would
benefit from player community feedback. Concealed Intent definitely
qualifies.</p>

<p>I hope to soon get back to regular posting here. In the meantime here is

  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently stopped playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: The
Gathering</a> in person. After a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/08/magic-the-gathering.html">brief spurt of
activity</a>,
I quickly slowed down to just playing the occasional pre-release or
other sealed tournaments, as much for the social event as the game.
However, over time my impression of the game has only diminished. It
takes too much time to play. Firstly there is the time taken to reach
the game store, then the time waiting for players to be ready to start.
If I get a return of one minute playing for two minutes waiting then I’m
doing well - often it is much worse!</p>

<p>Then there is the problem that many of the actual matches are just not
enjoyable. MtG relies on the concept of mana cards to act as a cost for
playing other cards. Unfortunately sometimes a player ends up with too
many or too few such cards (it is the luck of the draw) and as a result
might as well not be playing. In the “limited” games I tend to play
(“limited” format games do not reward paying extra for better cards, as
all the cards that can be played are provided to competitors at the
start) being “mana screwed” occurs to at least one of the players in
game roughly about 25% of the time. So around one in four of the games
are no fun (as I’m playing for the intellectual challenge, not to just
win).</p>

<p>So with increasingly little spare time, I decided to just stop playing.
But wait, what is this? A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">free-to-play</a> version of
the game is now available online! Maybe this will solve my issues.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/mtg_duels.png"><img src="/assets/posts/games/mtg_duels.png" alt="Magic Duels" /></a></p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Magic Duels (the online version of Magic) is a bit of a mess. I am quite
unimpressed. Some parts are as expected. The games are always standard
format (but with a small subset of the tabletop cards), so it could only
be expected that the game would try to sell you the extra cards. Magic
is probably the original pay-to-win game. The more one pays, the better
cards they will have and thus better chances of winning their matches.
This is carried over into Magic Duels - fair enough. It would have been
nice if there were some limited format games as well, but maybe they
will come later. At least they provide a mechanism to get the extra
cards without paying, but just playing a great deal over time. Still the
need to pay to be decently competitive rankles - and I won’t pay, so am
always playing from a position of weakness.</p>

<p>Being able to choose your cards has not helped the “mana screwing”
problem either. In fact in this game it seems to be even worse - at
least at the initial stages when a player does not have many cards. The
issue is amplified by the computer opponents having the most incredible
luck imaginable. They never seem to have mana problems and often draw
just the card they need right when they need it. Urgh. Of course it is
possible this is just good luck and normal variance, but if so I’m way
off into the land of many standard deviations beyond average. More
likely the developer has fixed it and gone a little too far. I wouldn’t
be surprised considering the numerous other issues with the game. It is
slow: my PC can run some of the latest 3D games smoothly, but it takes
20 seconds to start a 2D card game from the in-game menu? Something is
not right there. The UI seems to be built for mobile devices - it would
make much more sense if I had a thumb sitting in the bottom right
corner, but I don’t. This means that the time given to play instants is
barely enough to realise what is happening and drag you mouse across the
screen. Magic is not supposed to be a test of reflexes! As a competitive
game, it uses an online connection to maintain state and when this
connection can’t be established the game can’t be played. And the
connection has been down often. Very often. There have also been
numerous bugs, missing quests and other annoyances.</p>

<p>Annoying is a good term too describe this game. The mana issues and
problems have just reminded me of the flaws inherent in the original
game’s design. I get the feeling that it just doesn’t respect its
player’s time. I can’t imagine playing Magic live again, and after this
I probably won’t bother with the computer version either. Maybe its time
to give Hearthstone a try.</p>

    <p>Work, work, work. Over the last few months, I have been working hard to
complete Concealed Intent to a saleable standard. It is already the
longest (2.5 years), largest (&gt;30K LOC) project I’ve ever undertaken,
and getting better all the time. It is even <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">available for download
here</a>
at the moment (warning: in a alpha testing state). That link will
continue to host the current version until the game goes on sale as part
of Steam Early Access.</p>

<p>How long until Early Access? I’ve tried to <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2015/07/18/The-Best-Laid-Plans/">derive a plan over at my
work
blog</a>.
Early September is my target. The final run in is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>31st July</strong> - v0.9.11: Rework some parts of GUI, like the stats
panel and loadout screens.</li>
  <li><strong>14th August</strong> - v0.9.12: 1v1 online play and supporting screens.</li>
  <li><strong>28th August</strong> - v0.9.13: Steam integration, 3 extra missions and
some AI rework.</li>
  <li><strong>?? September</strong> - Profit! (or at least, Steam Early Access!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">take a look at the alpha
version</a>
if you can, and please leave feedback too (click ‘J’ at anytime in the
game).</p>
