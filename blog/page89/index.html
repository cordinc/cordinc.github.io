    <p>So you have decided to add full-text searching to your Ruby on Rails
application. After some investigation (see
<a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/rubyonrails-deployment@googlegroups.com/msg01882.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/articles/2008/03/17/rails-search-benchmarks/">here</a>)
<a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/">Sphinx</a> with the
<a href="http://blog.evanweaver.com/files/doc/fauna/ultrasphinx/files/README.html">Ultrasphinx</a>
plugin looks like the best solution for your needs. Just one problem,
despite your deployment environment being Linux, for various reasons
your current development environment is Windows. While Sphinx runs on
Windows, it explicitly states it prefers to run on other systems and
there are a few little gotchas. Here is the step by step guide to
getting it working:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Download the <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html">Windows
binaries</a> rather than
the source code.</li>
  <li>Extract the contents of the bin/release folder in the zip file you
just downloaded into a location of your choice (eg. C:\Sphinx).</li>
  <li>Add the location of the folder in step 2 into your system path.</li>
  <li>Install chronic - <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gem install chronic</code></li>
  <li>Install Ultrasphinx -
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">svn export svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/fauna/ultrasphinx/trunk vendor/plugins/ultrasphinx</code></li>
  <li>Copy the example default.base to the app config folder and edit it.
The path variable is the path to the location of the index (created
in step 10), not the Sphinx binaries. Also, find the “set_rotate”
option and set it to 0. This is not supported on Windows at the time
of writing. You probably want to have this set differently in
production.</li>
  <li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake ultrasphinx:configure</code> You should now have a Sphinx conf
file.</li>
  <li>Add indexing to your model.</li>
  <li>Edit the Ultrasphinx.rake (in plugins/ultrasphinx/tasks) and where
you see ‘#{Ultrasphinx::CONF_PATH}’ remove the apostrophes,
otherwise the rake task below won’t be able to find the
configuration file.</li>
  <li>Run rake <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ultrasphinx:index</code> You should now have an index in the
location specified in the conf path.</li>
  <li>Run rake <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ultrasphinx:daemon:start</code> The sphinx daemon should start
up.</li>
  <li>You are done and should be able to search. Good luck.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> In case you are not reading the comments, <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/03/installing-sphinx-ultrasphinx.html#comment-1">Naomi
Novik</a>
has pointed out that Sphinx/Ultrasphinx doesn’t seem to want to work if
the Rails project is in a directory with spaces in the path.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Some people have had problems beyond those I mentioned
above. Take a look at
<a href="https://rubyforge.org/forum/message.php?msg_id=49341">this</a> and
<a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/146630">this</a> if you have extra
problems.</p>

<p><em>Naomi Novik @ 2008-04-06</em> - Thanks so much for this terrific rundown – saved much much time. I thought I would add on that one other problem in Windows I encountered is that Sphinx/Ultrasphinx doesn’t seem to want to work if the Rails project is in a directory with spaces in the path (eg if you’re working under My Documents or whatnot).</p>

    <p>A recent <a href="http://javaposse.com/">Java Posse</a> podcast discussed UI design
and mentioned that some places like Apple take design very seriously,
actually starting the development process by deciding what the finished
product will visually look like. This has worked very well for Apple (I
love my Apple stuff) and is probably a good way to go if your product’s
end users may not be technically oriented. Unfortunately I have no
design skills (it is beginning to show in my project) and a key part of
what I’m trying to develop is that is easy to use, mainly because it is
not targeted at technical people.</p>

<p>I like to think of designs as a state-space (this itself is probably a
bad start!). Imagine a mountain range, the higher the peak the better
the design, so you want to stand at the highest point you can. Starting
at any random place in the range, you can either climb the mountain you
are on to the top or go down to climb a different taller mountain. It
all depends on whether you can see a taller mountain nearby. For the
purposes of this metaphor, I am nearly blind. Unless very lucky I will
not end up very high. Much like most of the other software engineers I
know!</p>

<p>Knowing these shortcomings, instead of a normal design process, I follow
the “Break &amp; Enter” school of design. That is I find something simple I
like and largely copy it. That’s fine for corporate websites or GUIs,
but I’m not sure how well it will work with the general public. This is
something I need to think about (comments welcome). At least it’s a
common problem. In the Java Posse podcast there were repeated questions
around how to instil a design culture or hire for design skills - I
don’t remember there being a good answer.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After having the simple startup idea (see
<a href="/blog/2008/02/ideas.html">here</a>) over the New Year holiday, I next
needed to decide how to implement it. Many people would say I needed to
write design/spec/use case documents first, but for this project I think
best to start working and see what happens. It would be easy to draw
diagrams and think about problems with nifty solutions. However, the
main goal is to DELIVER. I want to get something up and running quickly,
get some people to use it and then improve it. I believe the longer it
takes to get something up in front of people, the more likely I never
will reach that point or go further. Having people use the system (even
as testers) is a form of commitment.</p>

<p>As a result I chose to use <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>
for development - something many people who know me may find surprising.
I have never programmed in Ruby before, so I’m learning it at the same
time as trying to quickly develop a new system with fuzzy requirements.
What happened to avoiding development risks and not trying to do too
much at once? If I did a project risk assessment like most of my
previous employers this would raise some serious red flags - the project
would not be allowed to go ahead. Although, no previous employer would
allow my idea to go ahead anyway, they would see it as too small. So why
did I make the Ruby decision?</p>

<p>For the last 6 years I have almost entirely developed in Java (and
before that a mix of Java, C<span class="underline"></span> and other
languages that will never appear on my resume). I have worked on
developing a wide range of systems from the large (over 100 people for a
few years) to the very small (just me for a couple of weeks), although
mainly for large financial firms. However, I specifically did not want
to develop in Java. I may be faster in Java, but there are a number of
reasons I thought it best not use it this time. People say it can be
heavier to develop, with more boilerplate code, and I can certainly
understand that. There are also less decent internet hosting options for
Java, nearly every hosting firm provides PHP or Ruby options, but
finding a good Java host is harder. However, the main reason for me was
that with Java I was liable to get bogged down in the intricacies of the
language and various libraries or third party tools. With a new language
I wouldn’t have time to think further than the next problem I was facing
and finding a solution for it - there would be fewer distractions simply
because there wouldn’t be time to lose focus or investigate interesting
side issues.</p>

<p>Choosing the language was difficult. There were so many I wanted to try
as I haven’t properly taught myself new language since C# some years
ago. I have been reading (with interest) blog posts arguing (flaming?)
the pros and cons of various web development languages and frameworks.
Ruby on Rails seems to have a large following and been around for a
while. The basic idea has been copied so many times by other languages
(<a href="http://grails.org/">Groovy on Rails</a>, <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html">Rhino on
Rails</a>,
…) that I felt there must be something useful in there. I rejected all
the derivatives because I didn’t think they would be mature enough yet
and didn’t have a large enough community behind them. After all a
framework with a
<a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">backlash</a> must
have reached a certain level of maturity! The <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/12.html">speed
issue</a> was my main
concern. At work code execution speed is extremely important and has a
direct affect on the bottom line (I work on financial trading systems).
However, the performance requirements for my system are far less than at
work. Ruby will probably be fast enough - or at least fast enough at the
start to see if the idea is worth pursuing. So I decided to just give
Ruby a try. If it didn’t work out I could quickly move onto something
else.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve been writing Ruby on Rails code for nearly the last two
months in my spare time - probably only the equivalent of only a handful
of workdays in total. Yet I am quite impressed by how much functionality
I have implemented. I am probably only a couple of weeks away from being
ready for alpha testing on the functionality (the website design is
still a mess). So far I have to say that Ruby on Rails has been a
positive experience, although I am yet to properly test its performance.</p>

    <p>I have been writing this blog for almost a month and have signed up for
various tools, including <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/home">Google Web
Analytics</a>. I originally signed up
to learn how they work for my startup idea (more about that soon, I
promise), but now I think they are just cool.</p>

<p>For instance, thanks to analytics I know that 3 people regularly visit
my blog and two of them are me! I also know that on the 26th of
February, someone at Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho, typed “weird in
sign language” into google and came to my blog post about the sign
language for being bitten by an alligator. Obviously it wasn’t quite
what they were expecting so they left after a few seconds. For some
reason that little bit of knowledge puts a smile on my face.</p>

<p>FYI, the American Sign Language for “weird” is
<a href="http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/o/odd.htm">here</a>, and
that’s cool too.</p>
