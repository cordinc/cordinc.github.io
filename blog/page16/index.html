<p>The original Portal was a FPS puzzler of near perfection, can lighting
strike twice with its <a href="www.thinkwithportals.com/?">sequel</a> When using
portals, definitely!</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sjMuAeHozF4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Playing this is as close to gaming perfection I have ever managed. I
found myself getting lost occasionally in the middle transitional levels - that is the only negative thing to say about Portal 2 - everything
else is praise. The FPS gameplay is super smooth. The puzzles are just
right. They take a little thought and make the player feel like a genius
once solved, but never get so hard as to cause frustration and
rage-quitting. There are lots of little extras and hidden features. The
story is entertaining. Glados is one of the best computer game villains
ever. The new character Wheatley is good too. It is actually a funny
game - a rare achievement. Seriously, if you haven’t played this, you
should. Don’t just take my word for it. According to Steam it has a 98%
approval rating and completion rate of 37% - a huge number (it is
normally under 10, my game has a completion rate of &lt;1). Highly
recommended.</p>

<p>Portal 2 is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/620/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux at
US$19.99.</p>

<p>Want to smash planets together? Fire mega-lasers? Generally bring
destruction to your enemies? <a href="http://www.uberent.com/pa/">Planetary
Annihilation</a> has all this and more, lots
more, maybe too much more.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V_4Z-RG1A9I" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This is an ambitious attempt at breathing life into the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">RTS</a> genre from a few
years ago. However, the result is a bit of a mess despite being quite
interesting. The tactical gameplay seems to be standard - build up a
powerful military force and send it against your opponent before they
can do the same. The faster you can manage this the better. The game
innovates in the battlefield layout. It is played on on spherical
planets (quite beautifully rendered) that you can rotate the camera
around. Sometimes there are even multiple planets. To facilitate battles
there are a myriad of options and units. Vehicles, bots, aircraft, sea
ships, orbital ships, space ships plus factories and installations. It
is even possible to build a giant Deathstar-like laser. The complexity
overwhelms and there is little guide on how it is used. Many times I
found myself pausing the game to look up online how to use the special
feature of a unit. Games run from 10 minutes to over 2 hours! This game
is just too much, and not well explained.</p>

<p>Planetary Annihilation is out on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/233250/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux
at US$29.99. It has been bundled many times.</p>

<p>Hand drawn puzzler <a href="http://machinarium.net">Machinarium</a> is definitely
pretty, but the challenges fail to engage.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-BR_I9r2To" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>A poor robot dumped in the trash has to return and save the big robot
city. This is achieved by solving a series of puzzles using point &amp;
click gameplay. Machinarium is a gentle game, that can be played at any
pace and provides both hints to the solution or, after a mini-game, a
complete walkthrough. All the problems fit thematically with the story
and robot city world. The art is notably different and interesting.
However, after a couple of hours I got stuck, and upon utilising the
walkthrough discovered the the rules of puzzle solving had changed. This
is greatly annoying. I prefer to solve the brain teasers myself, but
this seemed to require a jump in logic or to cheat. Perhaps this is
standard for the genre (I am not particularly experienced with them),
but it stopped me moving any further.</p>

<p>Discard that cup of tea my good man. Devilish robots abound. You must
patiently sneak around and survive. Persevere, because <a href="http://www.big-robot.com/tag/sir-you-are-being-hunted/">Sir, You Are
Being Hunted</a></p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBwo1-W-pnk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Sir, You Are Being Hunted the player is a Victorian gentlemen somehow
transported to an island full of murderous robots. Your only hope is to
construct an escape machine out of components found around the island -
although the robots tend to congregate around these items. The game
plays like an early survival game with a first-person view. Players need
to replenish their vitality by finding food (usually in abandoned
buildings). Trying to fight the robots results in a quick death (for me
at least). The only viable plan seems to be: hide and distract.</p>

<p>The artstyle is tweedpunk - Victorian gentlemen mixed with procedurally
generated English countryside horror. It works well and has many nice
touches. Unfortunately (for me) the game is super hard and slow. Perhaps
it can be mastered with more time and patience. I want to like this
game, it does so much right, but instead after several hours and barely
making a scratch I have to admit defeat and move onto something else.</p>

<p>A new turn-based indie monster battler is in development. Does
<a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/beastmancer">Beastmancer</a> show promise? It
is still very early days (alpha demo!) and can only get better, but is
already looking great.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GazVGkOiq4o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>An important part of developing a game is gathering feedback on how it
plays. Sometimes this can be hard as an indiedev, and so the solo
developer of Beastmancer released an alpha demo free on IndieDB. In the
game the player collects fantastical beasts and then uses them in
turn-based battles against other beasts. Sort of like Pokemon, but more
JRPG’ish. The game is surprisingly playable considering its early stage.
And looks quite good with cell-shaded graphics and many animations
(although a few more in the fights are needed). There are a few issues
to be ironed out. Saving/loading does not work and there are long load
times (at least on my old’ish PC). The battles lack a certain oomph,
there are few special attacks and mostly it is just charge and bash.
Lastly, the story is too dominant and the maps too big, meaning that
there is little fighting and lots of listening/running around. I look
forward to seeing how it progresses.</p>

<p>Beastmancer is available for free as a PC-only alpha demo on
<a href="http://www.indiedb.com/games/beastmancer">IndieDB</a>.</p>
