    <p>Following on from <a href="/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Functional Programming in
Scala</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> is the more advanced
<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/reactive">Reactive
Programming</a>. <a href="http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/">Reactive
programming</a> is a style of writing
concurrent event-based asynchronous programs and appears to fit nicely
into Scala’s functional programming model. It is claimed this paradigm
is essential for large scale high performance systems - and my working
experience backs this (although my experience is not with any systems
that describe themselves as “reactive”, instead they were just bespoke
or 3rd party asynchronous event-driven libraries).</p>

<p>Over 7 weeks the course is taught by 3 lecturers: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky">Martin
Odersky</a> (Scala’s creator);
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/headinthebox">Erik Meijer</a>; and,
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/instructor/rolandkuhn">Roland Kuhn</a>, lead
developer on the <a href="www.akka.io">Akka</a> reactive library. starting with
some more advanced Scala techniques including the introduction of
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/44965/what-is-a-monad">monads</a>, the
course quickly moves onto handling asynchronous computation with
futures, promises and observables. The last three weeks introduce
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model">Actors</a> for concurrency. Each
week there is around an hour or two of video lectures and all but the
last week included a programming assignment (taking a few hours to
complete). Production quality is high.</p>

<p>This course demonstrated both the best and worst parts of online
courses. The well presented material is very interesting and probably
very useful for me professionally. I have downloaded all the lectures so
they can be periodically reviewed and spent some time ensuring I learnt
the concepts. So far, so good - I am happy to have participated.
However, the assignments were another story. Firstly, the assignments
were badly specified. For all but the last week (I guess the organisers
had learnt by then), I had to reread the assignment many times before
even starting. I would usually also have to read the FAQ (why does an
assignment have a separate FAQ!) and check the forums (full of people
similarly confused) for discussions on the gaps in the specification.
The whole thing seemed a little haphazard.</p>

<p>The assignments were also dumbed down. After the first week there were a
number of complaints the assignments were too hard. Hence the due date
for all assignments was extended by a week and a student could submit an
unlimited number of attempts using the best result (instead of the
original maximum of 5 attempts). As a result students no longer needed
to write tests for their code - they could rely on the automatic grader
to test for them (doing so before would likely use too many submissions
before finishing).</p>

<p>I did the course to learn advanced Scala, not to obtain credentials. On
this measure it succeeds. However, MOOC credentials will always be near
worthless if students know that with a little moaning they can have the
course made substantially easier. I imagine the lecturers’ motivation
must be to get as many students through the course as possible. From my
experience, the most popular and most highly completed courses are the
easiest. The only two “difficult” courses I have started (this one and
<a href="/blog/2013/02/introduction-to-astronomy.html">Introduction to
Astronomy</a>), were made
considerably easier after a single week. Dropping coursework to the
lowest common denominator may be great for passing huge numbers of
students, but it won’t do the reputation of these online courses any
good.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A non-technical friend of mine expressed an interest in trying out the
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/insidetheinternet">Internet History, Technology, and
Security</a> course on
<a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. I agreed to do the course with
them as support. So I ended up studying this basic introduction to the
Internet for 9 weeks at the same time as <a href="/blog/2013/12/mitx-a-global-history-of-architecture.html">A Global History of
Architecture</a>.</p>

<p>Consisting of 4 weeks history, 3 weeks on the layer model of networking
and 2 weeks on security, I didn’t learn much during this course.
Admittedly, a Computer Science graduate with over twenty years
experience (including university) is not the intended audience. It is
for people with little or no technical background. The course acts as a
relaxed and easy introduction to the Internet. Each week consists of
under an hour of video lectures and a mini-test. There is a multiple
choice exam at the end and peer assessed assignments for bonus marks.</p>

<p>The presenter could charitably be called an acquired taste. There is
quite a bit of talking about himself. The highlights for me were the
interviews with various people instrumental in building the Internet.
These include a few of the lesser known innovators like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Metcalfe">Robert
Metcalfe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Cailliau">Robert
Cailliau</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Jacobson">Van
Jacobson</a>. The history starts
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchley Park</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus_computer">Colossus</a>, but then
moves quickly onto early networks and the start of the Internet. The
history stops once the network becomes a given after the beginnings of
the web and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape">Netscape</a> (later
transformed into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla">Mozilla</a>). The
lecturer does a good job of describing in simple terms how the Internet
stack works, without resorting to code. Instead of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">10 layer OSI
model</a> I learnt at university, a
more understandable 4 layer stack is presented as: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_layer">Link
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet">Ethernet</a>); the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_layer">Internet
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Protocol">IP</a>); the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer">Transport
layer</a>
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol">TCP</a>);
and, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_layer">Application
layer</a> (web browsers,
email, etc). While repetitive, the system is explained very well -
packets become analogous to postcards, routers to train stations and
port numbers to telephone extensions. The security lectures are more a
users guide and reminder that a system can never be completely secure.
There is also discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">Public key
cryptography</a> and
how it is used on the Internet.</p>

<p>I think the last word should belong to the friend who prompted my
attendance on this course. They said “interesting but basic, I learnt
enough to make it worthwhile. The lecturer was poor. I probably wouldn’t
finish if you were not doing it with me.”</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Nearly <a href="/blog/2011/01/a-global-history-of-architectu.html">3 years ago I
wrote</a> about
receiving the textbook “A Global History Of Architecture” in return for
the use of one of my photos of Pompeii. When I discovered the
<a href="http://web.mit.edu/">MIT</a> course given online by one of the authors and
using this textbook, I had to signup.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Global-History-Architecture-Francis-Advisor/dp/0470402571/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1293707766&amp;sr=8-2"><img src="/assets/posts/global_history_of_architecture.jpg" alt="A Global History Of Architecture" /></a></p>

<p>The couse is called <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/mitx/mitx-4-605x-global-history-architecture-884">A Global History Of
Architecture</a>
(yes, the same as the textbook), available through
<a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a> and instructed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Jarzombek">Mark
Jarzombek</a>. EdX is another
of the online university course providers, similar to the previously
discussed <a href="/blog/tag/Coursera.html">Coursera</a> although with a different
(but strangely overlapping) set of universities involved. Other than
graphic design, there is very little difference between EdX and
Coursera; the manner of instruction, facilities and testing are all
largely the same. A student should just signup wherever they find
interesting courses.</p>

<p>At 12 weeks this is very long for an online course - 8 weeks of lectures
regularly interspersed by 4 weeks with just an exam. The exams barely
qualify as such. None took me more than 20 minutes (the notes suggest an
hour) to complete the various multiple choice and categorisation
questions. Each lecture week includes over 3 hours of video instruction
(cut up into roughly 10 minute segments) with mini-tests. However, these
videos are not specially made for EdX. They are actual university
lectures from MIT - the back of the original students’ heads can
sometimes be seen. The lectures are the jewel in this course. Professor
Jarzombek presents well and is clearly talking on topics that greatly
interest him.</p>

<p>While the topic is nominally architectural history, it is more a general
history of the world illuminated with architectural examples (more <a href="/blog/2011/07/a-history-of-the-world-in-100.html">A
History of the World in 100
Objects</a> than <a href="/blog/2013/09/hsar-252-roman-architecture.html">Roman
Architecture</a>). There is
also regular and interesting discussion of trade flows and migration
patterns through history and how these promoted the interchange of ideas
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memes">memes</a> I suppose). The course
suggests many civilisations rose and fell with changing trade routes.
For instance, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_Empire">Khmer
Empire</a> centred on modern day
Cambodia rose on the southward movement of trade between Europe and
China due to climatic changes around 600-1400AD. With the rise of the
Mongols the original <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_route">Silk
Route</a> re-established itself
and sea based trade diminished along with the fortunes of the Khmer.
However, before this happened Indian stonesmiths and architects brought
their religions and architectural styles to the booming region. Another
example is that statues of Buddha only began to appear once Buddhist
monks traveling along trade routes from India to China encountered the
Hellenistic (and statue producing) societies in central Asia (remnants
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seleucid_Empire">Alexander the Great’s
empire</a>). This occurred
centuries after the religion was founded.</p>

<p>The course starts with the beginnings of human society and takes two
weeks before reaching the first towns and cities of the Middle East.
This sets the scene for the nature of the lectures - most time is spent
on art, religion, trade and the way people lived. Then this background
is used to explain the reasons why, how and where certain buildings are
constructed. The mechanics of various religions are particularly
important as most buildings that survive over 1000 years (or were
written about) held some religious significance. There is also regular
discussion of how buildings model certain ideas. The columns of Greek
temples supposedly represent forest groves; the peaks of Hindu temples
model <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meru">Mount Meru</a>; the palace
at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis">Persepolis</a> is a giant
meeting ground (like an ancient convention centre). Sometimes this idea
can be quite abstract. Etruscan temples (which along with Greek temples,
influenced the Romans) were supposed to model the movement of birds
flying through the air.</p>

<p>There is also some discussion of how buildings change over time. Many
buildings change usage over time. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenon">Parthenon</a> has been a temple,
church, mosque, ruin and tourist site over its 2500 year history. Other
buildings grow in importance and are thus modified. Egyptian temples
grew in power by adding new parts to the building. Churches and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stupa">stupas</a> generally can’t be
expanded, so instead sites that became more important just built more
churches and stupas.</p>

<p>This is a thought-provoking rush through human history from the first
societies to colonialism. The course presents history via the forces
acting on cultures, unlike the standard tick-tock of historical events.
An interesting perspective and certainly worth a viewing of the
lectures. You also might learn a little about architecture.</p>

<p><em>Sandu Jayasinghe @ 2016-09-10</em> - hey i signed up for the course this year and am kind of nervous about it. I was hoping u to enlighten me on how tough the course and the exams are. as im already a university student and hence won’t have much time to spend on the online course. thanks</p>

<p><em>Charles @ 2016-09-10</em> - Hi, I don’t remember the assessments being particularly hard in this course. There were weekly tests consisting of multiple choice or categorisation questions. They generally took me half the time they were supposed to take. Same with the final exam. The main issue is finding the time to watch the videos and other materials. I remember that being many hours per week. Anyway, all that was over 3 years ago, it may have changed since then. In any case good luck!</p>

<p><em>Sandu Jayasinghe @ 2016-09-11</em> - thanks a lot for the information and for replying. it was helpful</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com">Kickstarter</a> website allows people to
pledge money towards the completion of various projects (games, movies,
products, or lots of other ideas). Usually the project organisers give
something in return and keep in communication with backers. I joined
last September specifically to back a certain project (see the first
project below). Since then I have backed 10 more projects. My only rule
(so far) is never to back a project at a level which includes physical
goods - I don’t need more stuff.</p>

<p>It appears to be an emerging tradition to detail the result of backing
Kickstarter projects. As I haven’t backed a new project in nearly 3
months, and many have finished, it seemed a good time to reflect on my
experiences. In order of when I pledged, my backed projects are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/obsidian/project-eternity">Project
Eternity</a>
<em><span class="ongoing 14, Apr due 12, Sep pledged"></span></em> - Me and
nearly 74,000 of my mates backed this little computer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">RPG</a>. It is one of
the more successful Kickstarters, and is the reason I joined the
site. It is being built to a similar design and by a similar team to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planescape:_Torment">Planescape:
Torment</a> - that is
enough of a sales pitch for me, I pledged enough to get a copy on
release. Since being funded, the project team sends weekly updates
on their progress. I am fairly comfortable waiting for this game.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/10x10room/conclave">Conclave</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Feb due 12, Sep pledged"></span></em> - This
project was backed on a a whim when it appeared unlikely it would
reach its target. Now I understand that total pledges tend to surge
in the final day, as it did in this successful project. It is a
HTML5 RPG game where the first 10 missions are free (<a href="http://www.playconclave.com/">playable
here</a>). The team delivered all they
promised, largely on time. I have played through about half the
current game and it is a decent enough distraction for a couple of
hours. No regrets here.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1035580424/blackspace-plan-dig-defend-survive">Blackspace</a>
<em><span class="unsuccessful 12, Oct pledged"></span></em> - The only
project I backed that did not reach its funding goal. This is a
computer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">RTS</a> game
when the player builds and defends facilities on asteroids. I had a
very similar idea and was keen to see how theirs’ looked.
Unfortunately, little progress has been made (if any) since the
funding failure - a pity.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1499900830/sir-you-are-being-hunted">Sir, You Are Being
Hunted</a>
<em><span class="late 13, Jul due 12, Nov pledged"></span></em> - A very
cool looking “tweedpunk”
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">FPS</a> game where
you are hunted by robots dressed like English country gentlemen. The
game is in alpha and available on
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a>. It is technically running
late, but since the current version is playable and the
oversubscribed kickstarter resulted in many stretch goals, I’m not
worried.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1473965863/sui-generis">Sui
Generis</a>
<em><span class="ongoing 14, May due 12, Nov pledged"></span></em> - A very
impressive and ambitious tech demo for this computer RPG led me to
back it. There were a number of original ideas planned for the game
and I deemed it worth a try. Since then communication has been
sporadic, but gameplay videos show progress. I just doubt this can
be finished in the next 6 months, even another year seems like a
stretch to me. Hopefully the team won’t run out of money or descope
too heavily. Perhaps they could license their engine to other
developers.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/evilhat/fate-core">Fate Core</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Feb due 13, Jan pledged"></span></em> -
Another massively oversubscribed Kickstarter for a pen &amp; paper RPG.
There were so many stretch goals achieved on this one the value for
money became too good to pass up, even for people with only a
passing interest. Most of the backer rewards have been delivered (a
couple of the later stretch goals remain), and the quality seems
very high.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/enworld/rebuilding-en-world">EN
World</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Mar due 13, Jan pledged"></span></em> -
Before this Kickstarter I was aware of the <a href="http://www.enworld.org/">EN
World</a> website and considering joining to
help find local RPG groups (I didn’t join because it turns out
Facebook is the way RPG’ers connect in Malaysia). Then the site was
hacked and went to raise money to resurrect the site offering a ton
of pen &amp; paper RPG rewards for backers. Now the site is back (and I
joined, but mainly for the news) and the high-quality rewards
distributed (so many I haven’t had the opportunity to go through
them all yet!).</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2005963869/jeff-cannatas-new-show">Jeff
Cannata</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Apr due 13, Mar pledged"></span></em> - For
many years I watched Jeff Cannata as one of the 3 hosts of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Totally_Rad_Show">The
Totally Rad
Show</a>. It was a
free, fun and informative podcast. When he went to Kickstarter to
raise money for a new (although similar) podcast, I felt he deserved
some money from me for the hours of entertainment already provided.
Even better, my mate Jeff has now delivered the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/CannataJeff">Newest Latest
Best</a> podcast. It lacks the
chemistry of TRS, but is still very good and I happily watch it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/modiphius/achtung-cthulhu-the-ww2-keepers-and-investigators">Achtung
Cthulhu!</a>
<em><span class="delivered partially 13, Aug due 13, Mar pledged"></span></em> -
Cthulhu mythos adventures during World War 2. This pen &amp; paper RPG
was an easy sell to me. The original products from the Kickstarter
have been delivered, with the numerous stretch goal rewards still to
come. The quality of the books exceeded my expectations - very
impressive. I have also started playing in a AC! game and can
strongly recommend it.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1281758745/professional-mp3-background-loops-for-role-playing">RPG Background
Loops</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Aug due 13, Apr pledged"></span></em> - This
set of 80 background loops (each 10 minutes long) for RPG games was
backed on a whim. They are fine, but I’m not sure when I will get to
use them.</li>
</ul>

<!-- -->

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/545820095/weird-wars-rome-savage-worlds">Weird Wars
Rome</a>
<em><span class="delivered 13, Sep due 13, Aug pledged"></span></em> - Like
Achtung Cthulhu, an easy sell with a combination of Cthulhu mythos
in an Ancient Rome environment. Unfortunately, I have been
unimpressed with the quality of the delivered book - much lower than
the other Kickstarters I’ve backed. Disappointing.</li>
</ul>

<p>So after 10 projects backed successfully, only one is (forgivably) late,
one is a concern, and one had a disappointing result. I consider that a
good result and wouldn’t be apprehensive about backing more.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> mining is a method of turning
electricity into money. That aphorism percolated around my mind for some
time until it dawned that I don’t currently pay the full cost of
electricity. Unfortunately, while that situation has existed nearly a
year, it will end in a month. Cursing my sloth, I decided to experiment
with mining Bitcoins on my PC, and see how much profit can be made from
spare electricity.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is the most popular and valuable form of crypto <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_currency">digital
currencies</a>. That is, a
form of money that exists only in digital form and is “created” through
the solving of cryptographic problems (known as “mining”). There is no
government or bank backing Bitcoin - so if there is a problem it is
largely down to the community to look after itself. However, the
problems solved by “mining” are actually checks on Bitcoin transactions,
thus it is quite hard to hack the currency itself (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24871444">hacking banks that
hold Bitcoin balances</a> is
another issue entirely). From its origin in 2009 Bitcoin has continually
grown in presence and value - at the time of writing it is <a href="https://www.mtgox.com/">US$228 to
the Bitcoin</a>.</p>

<p>So I put my ageing desktop to work. Three years ago it was a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/01/building-a-new-pc.html">top end
gaming box</a>,
now it is middle of the road. Especially the Nvidia graphics card which
is utilised heavily in mining calculations. After downloading a <a href="https://github.com/ckolivas/cgminer">mining
program</a> and joining a <a href="https://www.btcguild.com/">mining
pool</a> (which combines members’ efforts and
shares the proceeds), my PC was dedicated to its task. After 72 hours of
continuous mining I accumulated 0.0004 Bitcoins - just under 8 US cents.
It was actually worse than that as the pool only pays out in units of
0.01 Bitcoins, so it would have taken mining 72 more days before
receiving anything. Not really worthwhile.</p>

<p>The pool’s combined computing power increased 10% over just the 4 days I
was watching, and apparently this is consistent with growth in total
power devoted to Bitcoin mining. Thus the amount earnt by a miner with
fixed power (like my PC) should decrease at the same rate (over
10%/week) - a rapid decline. Bitcoin mining is increasing exponentially
and as the supply is released at a fixed rate, only more powerful mining
rigs now earn back their costs. The most powerful miners are special
built <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC
machines</a>,
normal PCs can’t compete. It may be after electricity and purchase costs
even the new purpose built equipment can’t compete either! It seems only
the manufacturers are profiting - just like the gold rushes of old.</p>

<p>Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency, just the most well known and
developed. There are many others (a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cryptocurrencies">list of some is
here</a>). Some use
a different type of calculation for different purposes, for example
adding inflation or making it harder to use specially built miners. I
did the same experiment (same machine, same time period) with two lesser
known and less liquid currencies: <a href="https://litecoin.org/">Litecoin</a> and
<a href="http://feathercoin.com/">Feathercoin</a>.</p>

<p>If I mined continuously for 100 days at late October 2013 difficulty and
market prices, the result would be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bitcoin -&gt; 0.013 btc = US$2.60</li>
  <li>Litecoin -&gt; 5.2 ltc = US$10.40</li>
  <li>Feathercoin -&gt; 224 ftc = US$15.68</li>
</ul>

<p>All of which are probably less than the cost of electricity used. I
doubt anyone is going to get rich unless they buy high end machines or
specialist equipment - and take some large risks.</p>

<p>The experiment is now over.</p>
