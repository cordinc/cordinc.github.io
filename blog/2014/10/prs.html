<p>After leaving <a href="/blog/2013/06/beacon-technology-part-1.html">Beacon</a> and
finishing the MBA, I jumped on a flight to London in mid 2002. Perth was
too constraining, I didn’t want to do consulting or mining software for
the rest of my career. London seemed like the land of work opportunity.
It would also be easier to travel around the world from a base in
Europe. Both these reasons turned out to be correct, but I forgot the
downsides of London - the expense, the crowds and strangely even the
weather. For a good five years or so the positives outweighed the
negatives, but then the balance shifted. However, upon arrival I was
extremely optimistic.</p>

<p>Crashing in the spare rooms and sofas of old uni friends (the Perth to
London road was well travelled by my age cohort), I started to learn
about the local IT job market. 2002 was the middle of the dot crash
slump. Stories of easy jobs with large pay rates and regular job hopping
abounded, but they always ended with “of course that was before the
crash.” Most of my acquaintances said that contract work was the way to
go - better pay and less bureaucracy, at the expense of career
progression (none of my friends planned to stay long, so that was not an
issue). I aimed for the same, but in the downturn a person with no
record in London couldn’t get through the door for contracting roles - I
was too much of an unknown considering the large number of people
looking for work. After a few months I switched to permanent roles and
started getting interviews again. Lastminute was a notable interview
because the interviewer was so offensive I pledged to never use their
service - a promise I hold to this day, despite being right in their
target market. After 4 months my funds were evaporating quickly and if I
didn’t get one of the two jobs for which I was interviewing then a
return to Perth would be required. <a href="http://www.rbs.co.uk/">RBS</a> was my
preferred option (and I even delayed the other possibility while waiting
for them to decide). However, RBS decided I was “too cold” for a
management position (at least they gave a reason), so I went to work at
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_for_Music">MCPS-PRS Alliance</a>.</p>

<p>The Alliance is the UK company that controls music copyrights. It is
sort of like a club - songwriters register their rights with the
Alliance. Then it collects any royalties on their behalf and distributes
them (after deducting costs). As the effort in dealing with record
companies, radio/TV stations and other business using music is
non-trivial, it makes sense to spread the costs across as large a number
of artists as possible - that way they all earn more from their
royalties. Thus the Alliance is the only firm doing this in the UK (as
it has done since the start of copyright law in the country, when it
mainly collected royalties for sheet music. It has the scale to do the
job efficiently (others have tried and failed). The Alliance is split
into two parts, MCPS handled the physical rights (for example, the
royalties due to the songwriter when a CD is made); and PRS which
handled performing rights (the royalties due if a song was played on the
radio or TV).</p>

<p>I was on the PRS side and this is how their business works. Songwriters
register their songs once written detailing the fractional ownership.
This often goes down to 1/128th of the song and can get quite
complicated. Firstly recording companies normally take a large cut for
producing the song, but legally they can not take more than 50%. After
that songs are often written by teams, so they need to decide the split
between them. Then there are cover versions and samples, all of which
complicate the situation. Take for instance the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gipsy_Kings">Gipsy
Kings</a> version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Way">My
Way</a> - the Gipsy Kings get some of
the royalties for translating the lyrics from the English language
version (made famous by Frank Sinatra) and rearranging the music, the
person who wrote the English lyrics gets some ownership, then the
songwriter and lyricists of the original french version are also listed.
Of course all the recording companies down the line also take a share.
There is also the humorous case involving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4?33?">John Cage’s
4’33</a> (a song consisting solely of 4
and a half minutes of silence). Another band create a song of a minute’s
silence and called it a cover of 4’33”, Cage sued for copyright
infringement and won. Getting the ownership correct can get quite
complicated.</p>

<p>PRS has a database of ownership records for every UK song, it doesn’t
matter if they have never actually been performed, it only matters that
a member has registered them. They also have ownership records for any
foreign song which is likely to be played in the UK and is controlled by
a friendly overseas copyright authority (which is most of them). This
corresponds to millions and millions of records, many of which are very
similar. Again, think of all the cover versions of My Way, each with
slightly different royalties. The database had 100’s gigabytes of data.</p>

<p>Broadcasters send in lists of the songs they played. Lists come in from
radio stations, TV stations, concerts, jukeboxes, and there are also
surveys from companies that play music in the course of business - like
muzak or hairdressers. Think how many songs a radio station plays in a
day, now multiply that by the number of stations in the UK. Similar for
TV stations - remember that the jingle in an ad or the intro music to a
show all count and need to be listed. At least tens of thousands of
listings come in every day, some days it numbers in the hundreds of
thousands. Also, the quality of this data varies enormously. The BBC
sends nicely formatted electronic records of song, artist, and duration
played every day. A concert hall may send handwritten set lists once a
month or less.</p>

<p>All the listings go into a batch system that attempts to match the songs
played to royalty records in the database. Most of these matches could
be done by computer, but many need a human to work it out correctly.
There are a couple of rooms of people manually matching songs. Money
would then be allocated on a percentage basis from the fees paid by the
organisation that played the music. So if a radio station paid
£1000/month and one month they played a song 1% of the time, then that
song’s owners would share £10 between them, split according to the
royalty records. This is totaled and paid out every quarter as long as a
threshold amount is reached (£10, I think). The majority of artists in
the system don’t earn enough royalties in a quarter to receive a payout.
The system is hugely hit based and skewed towards a few big earners.
Although a surprising number of people can make a living from it.
Apparently the people who write ad jingles do quite well.</p>

<p>By the time I arrived the system was beginning to come under strain. It
could still process a busy days worth of listings in a day, but it was
getting close. At the expected rate of growth the system would need
improving or replacing soon’ish. However, the existing system was
originally completed in the early 80’s and ran on mainframes (some of
the people from that project were still around in the early 00’s when I
was there). Software and hardware was being end-of-life’d by vendors. A
complete replacement would be required. As the Alliance did not have the
skills for a large new development in-house, it was decided to contract
a large US-European IT consulting firm. It was also decided that the new
system should be web-based, written in Java and use the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process">RUP</a>. The
Alliance had no experience in any of these areas, while I had experience
of all three. My job was three-fold: keep an eye on the consultants and
check they were acting in the interests of the Alliance; train up the
Alliance’s in-house people in the new technologies being used; and, work
as a team member and manager in developing the new system.</p>

<p>At first I worked with a couple of the consultants on a prototype while
giving presentations on the RUP process to managers and executives at
the Alliance. Soon a small team of Alliance developers needed to be
trained in Java. Two days a week I was at the Alliance offices in the
West End of London. The Alliance people were all very friendly and
social - teams tended to eat lunch together, which in my experience
suggests good project dynamics. All the teams had favourite pubs and
there would always be someone around you knew out on Thursday and Friday
nights (usually other nights too). It seemed like a very comfortable and
easy place to be. Many people had worked for the Alliance for decades.
The company also took training more seriously than anywhere else I’ve
been. The Java developers I mentored were internal IT people being
cross-trained in Java from scratch (including nearly a month of external
courses). I went on two training courses in the short time I was there,
including a trip to Darmstadt in Germany. Also, the managers were good
and actually managed people.</p>

<p>The other three work days each week were spent at the consultants fancy
new office south of London. This was not such a happy time. Although it
was a much nicer commute, as most people went in the other direction.
Initially, the consulting team was four people in total: two developers,
manager and me. The consulting team was a little cold and we didn’t
become friends. In fact there were a number of minor clashes. I never
felt welcome and this clouded my experience. The team had enough talent
to get the prototype done successfully and only a little late. The other
devs were certainly good enough at their job - solid programmers who had
done this before. Although it was here one of the managers performed
<a href="/blog/2008/06/reality-used-to-be-a-friend-of.html">one of the stupider planning tricks I’ve
witnessed</a>.</p>

<p>Once the project started properly the problems began. Firstly the
consulting team greatly expanded, and the quality of the consulting
developers greatly dropped. The standard bait-and-switch I’ve seen
consulting companies perform a number of times. Also, more of the
business people who would actually use the system began to get their
hands on the work-in-progress. Many changes were requested and
timescales began to slip as the requests were processed into the plan.
The basic problem was that a web-based system was not suitable for the
heavy data entry the system’s users performed. While the computer
matching would be better than before, the human based matching would be
much slower, so overall the system would be about the same as the old
version. The supposed benefits of a web based system turned out to be
spurious - thin clients and working from home were not important to the
business users, but speed of data entry was crucial. In retrospect this
is obvious. I consider it a personal failing that I didn’t see that the
choice of technology was wrong. Although in my defence the technology
was chosen before I was hired and was actually the reason for my
employment. I took the choice as axiomatic and didn’t question it.</p>

<p>The project problems led to one of the funnier moments in my career. One
day I was the only Alliance person at the consultant’s office when admin
assistants moved through the area and told everyone to assemble for an
all-hands meeting. A new project manager had just started as the
previous acted as a sacrificial lamb for the increasingly obvious
issues. The new manager introduced himself with a speech to the whole
consulting team, and me. He said that after reviewing the project he
felt that the the team was working well and the problem was
substantially the fault of difficult customers. Then came the punchline,
the new managers proudly boasted that in many years of leading teams he
had never been successfully sued and did not intend to sully that record
with this project. What the … No one around me seemed surprised by this
statement (and my head was swivelling around). I couldn’t believe what I
had just heard. How many times had customers unsuccessfully sued him?
Were lawsuits common outcomes from this consulting firm’s projects? I
told my managers at the Alliance immediately and they found it funny
too.</p>

<p>A couple of weeks after that meeting the project was cancelled. The
Alliance decided to halt the Java project and restart it as a thick
client <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Forms">Oracle Forms</a>
project. The consulting firm was kept on, just swapping Java devs for
Oracle specialists. I was offered the chance to retrain, but decided
against it as I believed (and still do) that Java is a more marketable
skill than PL/SQL. Thus I was made redundant, but they were very nice
about it, and financially it worked out fine. It was an understandable
result of the situation - there was no point in having a Java specialist
around. Including the month I spent looking for a new job after being
given notice, I was at the Alliance only nine months. Although I still
keep in contact occasionally with people I met there.</p>
