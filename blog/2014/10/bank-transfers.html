<h4>Bank Transfer Errors</h4>

<p>At least in the UK, it is often best to pay money to people via bank
transfer. This is the process where the payer enters the bank account
number of the payee into some system and then the money is moved
directly from bank account to bank account. It is easy and costs nothing
(in the UK). I used to use it all the time for paying rent and similar
bills.</p>

<p>It is surprising to hear that errors regularly occur in this process.
People type in an incorrect bank account number and so the wrong person
receives the money. Obviously in some distress, the payer contacts the
bank to fix the problem, but the bank doesn’t see it as their problem.
Pushing or getting the media involved often gets the required results
(see
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/30/online-cash-transfer-error">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/mar/18/banks-slow-transferred-cash-wrong-account">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/09/26000-banking-error">here</a>
and many more online stories).</p>

<p>I’m not surprised people type the account number incorrectly; that is
always going to happen. I’m surprised that such an error results in a
valid bank account. If the bank account number included a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a>, then an incorrectly
transcribed number is unlikely to still be valid. Credit cards use a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">checksum algorithm</a> and
this is why when you type one incorrectly the response is “invalid card
number” rather than the wrong account being charged. However, bank
account numbers seem to rarely use this simple error-checking technology
(codes by country are <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18727_01/doc.121/e13483/T359831T498954.htm">listed
here</a>).
Why not? Perhaps when the bank account system was established many
decades ago, checksums were not seem as important. Either because there
was a person (the local bank manager) in the loop to double check the
numbers, or because checksums were too computationally costly
(especially if humans had to do the calculation themselves as computers
weren’t available). Of course now people use the Internet to make
transfers and the whole process is performed by computers without human
interference, and the cost of using checksums is miniscule on even
relatively old processors.</p>

<p>Banks could add checksums now, placing an optional extra character to
the end of bank account numbers (several countries have done this). In
the UK this would be a huge act of customer service. However, from
experience I would doubt the banks interest in serving their customers.
At the moment any errors cost the banks little and changing the system
would be expensive. The core computer programs handling bank accounts
and transfers between them are ancient COBOL programs (at least at the
bank where I worked). Rules like the number of digits in a bank account
are hardcoded and changing them would cascade through various systems.
Testing the change would be a massive task in itself. I can’t imagine
any bank voluntarily undertaking such a project - especially as most
banks are determined to reduced IT costs. Too bad for bank customers.</p>
