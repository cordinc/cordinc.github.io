<p>This final part of my high-school
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign’s
history starts with the player characters rich, powerful and famous.
While at this point the party only had four members, each was around
level 10-11 and loaded down with magic items. Together, there were few
creatures in the world they couldn’t crush. Challenging the players was
becoming difficult and ridiculous (witness the hordes of hell that
finished <a href="/blog/2014/01/dd-campaign-history-part-3.html">part 3 of this
history</a>). As a group we
took a break for a year and fought the Kafer War in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2300_AD">2300AD</a> instead. Then returned,
refreshed, and reacquainted ourselves with the characters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Raven - a huge brutish warrior with spiky armour to match his
demeanour</li>
</ul>

<p>At this point I made a mistake. I should have arranged ever more
outrageous adventures, making a virtue of how completely overpowered the
characters had become. What I did was make them join the aristocracy and
started the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_the_Warlords">Test of the
Warlords</a> module. In
this characters are elevated to landed nobles in the newly colonised
northern reaches of a local empire. Each player controlling a small
barony in the larger kingdom. Thus the campaign became more a strategy
game. The players would spend their time managing their domains,
building castles and handling court intrigue. The map of their holdings
is below, the little solid squares represent the character’s castles.
There was the occasional battle to liven things up (a giant incursion
led the players to run through the classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_the_Giants#G2_Glacial_Rift_of_the_Frost_Giant_Jarl">Glacial Rift of the Frost
Giant
Jarl</a>
adventure). However, on the whole it was clear the players weren’t
particularly interested.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/rpg/Baronies.png"><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/Baronies.png" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>With the game looking like it would fall apart, I had to change tack
quickly. I adapted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl_from_the_North">Howl of the
North</a> for our game
and we went adventuring again. By this stage it was 5 years since those
first days in my bedroom. I had finally (just before the end) decided
how the game world worked. Magic came from the presence of incredibly
powerful magic beings that mortals called “gods”. Originally there were
no “gods” and little magic in the world. Then a relatively powerful (by
the standards of the age) mage called Phren correctly worked out the
universes cosmology and created a magical beacon to summon “gods” to the
world. His plan was to use the increase in magic to ascend to godhood
himself. The beacon took the form of 5 swords, that when joined would
blaze in magical fire throughout the multiverse. To protect himself
against malicious gods, Phren created various anti-magic swords. It was
one of these the players used to close the portal to hell in the
previous part of this history. Phren’s plan worked, he ascended to
immortality and the “gods” that answered the beacon became the world’s
current pantheon (including Kiri-Jolith, the party’s cleric’s god). Then
the swords forming the beacon were scattered.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/HowlFromtheNorthCover.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So the swords in the “Howl of the North” module became Phren’s beacon
swords. The players were tasked by Kiri-Jolith with recovering the
swords in opposition to a chaos cult that had already started their
collection. The current gods didn’t want any more immortals taking an
interest in their fiefdom. The characters were not informed what purpose
the swords served as the gods were worried the powerful players would
try to use them to ascend themselves. This allowed me to have some fun
with the players. One of the swords was located in the possession of
another powerful party of evil adventurers. As the players came close to
victory in battle over this party, the opposing evil cleric called upon
Takhisis (the evil god known to be in direct opposition to Kiri-Jolith)
to save them. Takhisis promptly appeared, slew the remaining members of
the evil party and then told the players they were doing good work. This
lead to over an hour of the players debating what the hell was going on - one of my better moments as a DM.</p>

<p>It was also to be one of my last moments as a DM. Just a few weeks after
this, the game ended as the players became to busy with other things to
play. We never restarted.</p>

<p>So here is what I planned would happen next. The players would succeed
in collecting all the beacon swords, but in the finale become surrounded
by an army of overwhelming force, including people with some of Phren’s
anti-magic swords. Unable to escape, they are be prompted by a sage
traveling with them to combine the swords as the only path to salvation.
Once combined, the swords glow and storm clouds gather (very cliched).
The players feel a presence and are told their enemies will be
annihilated. The army surrounding them is slaughtered, the presence
fades. After dismantling the swords, the players journey home. Little do
they know a new chaos “god” has entered the world.</p>

<p>When they arrive home they find a battle raging. Another nearby empire
has invaded and the King has fallen ill. Rallying the troops in the
King’s absence, they push back the enemy forces. Then they discover a
shadowy group of wizards is leading the invading army. The players
personally infiltrate the opposing camp to neutralise this controlling
force. While doing this they realise Bandance (an ex-party member who
left in <a href="/blog/2013/02/dd-campaign-history-part-2.html">part 2 of this
history</a>) is leading the
enemy wizards. They defeat the wizards and the army, but Bandance
escapes. With their domains in ruins, the players decide to leave their
titles behind and track down Bandance. Although this also leads them to
the new chaos god!</p>

<p>And that is the end, both in reality and fantasy.</p>
