<h4>Lovelace vs Hopper</h4>

<p>Apologies for the fake conflict in the title. There is no actual fight.
It is only that there is regularly talk of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada
Lovelace</a> as a female role
model for computer science, but very little mention of the more
influential <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/Lovelace_Hopper.png" alt="Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper" title="Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper" /></p>

<p>With very few women studying Computer Science and becoming programmers
(or other computer specific professions), there is some discussion as to
what can be done to remedy the situation. Part of this has been the
promotion of female computing role models, and Ada Lovelace has been
prominent suggestion. Ada was born during the early 19<sup>th</sup>
century into the British aristocracy - both actual (her father was a
baron and she became a countess) and cultural (her father was the poet
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gordon_Byron">Byron</a>). Studying
mathematics at a time when higher education was largely closed to women,
she encountered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles
Babbage</a> and his designs
for a mechanical general purpose computer - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical
Engine</a>.</p>

<p>The Analytical Engine was never built (unlike Babbage’s calculator-like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine</a>).
Still Ada Lovelace studied the designs and wrote some programs to run on
it (calculating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number">Bernoulli
numbers</a>). She also wrote
notes displaying some foresight on how such machines could be used as
more than mere calculators (like modern computers). For this Ada
Lovelace is sometimes referred to as the first computer programmer.
Although I think she is closer to the first computer scientist (as her
code never ran - a trait in common with many lecturers I have known!).
Ada cuts a romantic, tragic figure - never having the chance to see her
work realised and dying at the age of 36. She has also been adopted by
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">Steampunk</a> crowd. Ada
Lovelace has cultural cachet.</p>

<p>I am not trying to diminish her achievements - they are notable given
the time period. However, I do not think they are influential or
important to modern computing as more than a point historical interest.
I have the same opinion of the Analytical Engine itself - both were a
technological dead-end.</p>

<p>Grace Hopper was born at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century into a
middle-class family in New York. By the 30’s she had become a
mathematics Professor at Vassar College. During the war, Grace became
part of the US Navy’s code breaking team - the less lauded US version of
the UK’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchly Park</a>.
After the war she stayed in the Navy and joined the team working on
building the early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC</a>
computer. Then Grace wrote the first
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>. The compiler is an
important part of the computer engineer’s toolbox - converting more
understandable programming languages into the assembly/binary understood
by the computer. This is work for which I am personally grateful, as I
like to keep as far from the bare computer metal as possible when
programming. She also created the first machine independent language.
This became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> after some
design by committee changes (Grace Hopper was part of that committee,
but let’s not hold that against her). Nearly 55 years since it was first
developed there is still COBOL running in production environments (I
have seen it at some banks). Considering her work on the early COBOL
compilers, it is possible that some of Grace Hopper’s code is still
being used half a century after being written. That is impressive
considering most of <a href="/blog/2012/04/lost-code.html">my code barely lasts a few
years</a>. She retired from the Navy as a
Rear Admiral and had a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hopper_(DDG-70)">ship named
after her</a> (perhaps not as cool as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)">programming
language</a>).</p>

<p>Grace was clearly a person of great technical ability. Unfortunately she
is most remembered for an anecdote. While tracing an error in a program,
Grace discovered a moth had become stuck inside the computer resulting
in the error causing fault. Thus was coined the term “bug” for errors in
computer code and “debugging” for fixing these errors. I think this
popular story masks her influence. It is hard to remember a woman who
has had more impact on the practical side of the professional computer
engineer. Grace Hopper would make an admirable role model for any coder,
regardless of gender.</p>
