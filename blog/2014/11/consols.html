<h4>Consols</h4>

<p>Reading stories about the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/business/blog/2014/oct/31/paying-the-price-of-war-britain-makes-good-on-historic-debts">British government beginning to pay down some
of its World War I
debts</a>
reminded me of my old job. I know a few people who are probably quite
happy this is finally happening. This is not because they believe the UK
has too much debt and needs to pay it off, but because it will make
their jobs just a little easier, as it would have for me five years ago.</p>

<p>The background is that the UK raised a very large amount of debt to pay
for fighting WWI. Soon after the war was finished the debt was
refinanced into “consols” (along with some older bonds). These consols
are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_bond">perpetual bonds</a> (we
used to call them “perps”) - a very rare form of debt where the original
debt need never be paid back (it is the government’s choice). Instead
they just pay interest for ever (“in perpetuality”), unlike normal
government bonds which mature and the principal repaid after some set
period of time (commonly 5, 10, or 20 years). Thanks to inflation and a
low rate of interest, it has never been in the financial interest of the
UK government to cancel their consols (and thus repay the principal) -
it is very cheap debt. Presumably right now is the unusual occasion when
interest rates are so low that paying off the consols makes sense (at
least I hope so). Of course it is also good publicity for a government
strongly associated with austerity to pay off such symbolic long-term
debts.</p>

<p>These consols and other perps comprise a vanishingly small fraction of
UK debt and an even smaller proportion of traded debt (as the debt
holders don’t tend to sell them very often). Someone working in UK and
European bonds could pretend they don’t exist, and 99% of the time this
would not be a problem. Then there is the other 1% of the time.
Perpetual bonds have a different set of calculations for working out
their price and other maturity dependent values. When writing code for
pricing and trading bonds, testing should include perps to check they
are correctly handled. In the fast paced world of front-office IT, this
extra checking is sometimes forgotten. Normally nothing untoward
happened as a result. However, errors did occur, normally days after the
code was released (as it takes that long for a perp transaction to
occur). I was lucky enough never to have that particular problem while
working in a bank, although I did something similar once with uncommon
<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/y/yield_basis.asp">yield-quoted
bonds</a> and felt
like an idiot for forgetting such instruments existed (but it never
happened again - I always tested with them after that).</p>

<p>So congratulations to the technical people writing fixed income pricing
and trading systems. With the consols gone there is failure point
removed. Hopefully soon your code will be simpler and all the <code>if
(isPerp) { … </code> blocks can be deleted.</p>
