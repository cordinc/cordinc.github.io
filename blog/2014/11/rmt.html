<h4>RMT</h4>

<p>Playing <a href="/blog/2014/08/eve-online.html">Eve</a> has really made me think
about the financials of online gaming with regards to digital goods.
Like most online games, Eve bans real money trading (RMT). That is, buy
or selling of in-game items for real-world money is forbidden. The
exception being that it is ok to buy PLEX (game time vouchers that can
be used in-game) from Eve or approved affiliates. A non-approved
reseller, Somer, was <a href="http://themittani.com/news/somer-blink-shutting-down">recently
shutdown</a>.</p>

<p>This intrigues me. It seems to me that real-world trading would make
players more engaged in a game. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life">Second
Life</a> made a virtue of RMT and
didn’t seem to suffer ill affects from the policy (their problems seem
to originate in being over-hyped). So why do nearly all MMOs ban the
practice? Is it because the companies want to control the market for
selling these goods themselves? Maybe partially, but having a resale
value only increases the possible primary sale price and increases
demand. I’m not sure this is the main reason. Perhaps there are legal
issues? I’m no lawyer, so this is possible. An online investigation
discovered another possible reason -
<a href="http://tobolds.blogspot.hu/2013/02/avoiding-rmt-issue.html">avoiding</a>
<a href="http://greedygoblin.blogspot.com/2013/02/whats-wrong-with-rmt.html">professionals</a>.</p>

<p>If it is possible to earn money from playing the game (through RMT),
then some people may find that that playing intensively results in
enough money to live (or thrive). This is definitely possible, even
although the activity is banned, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_farming">gold
farming</a> in many games is
profitable enough to make a living. The now closed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diablo_III">Diablo
3</a> auction house suffered a
similar problem. Some players acquired huge amount of loot and then sold
it so cheaply that other players without the same interest in grinding
would just buy it from them.</p>

<p>The problem seems to originate in the standard mechanics of such games.
In-game rewards come from endlessly repeatable activities - usually as
loot. Why get rewards for killing creatures? Why do those creatures
respawn over and over again? Why do the creatures have all this great
stuff on them (instead of leaving it at home) and why don’t they use it?
In some games, why can players carry so much? It is because these
loot-based rewards promote people playing - perform an action, get a
reward. Companies that produce these games want to discourage
professionalism so other players have a chance to partake in this
gamification. Introducing scarcity by limiting the spawning of enemies
would make the situation worse as this would make the resulting rewards
even more valuable.</p>

<p>To have RMT and reduce professionalism, these games would need to stop
repetition of gameplay as the basis for rewards - like Minecraft. Or,
stop repetition of the core gameplay, by perhaps time-limiting players
(but then a pro might have many characters or a whole team). Or, co-opt
the professionals’ activities into creating content for other players.
This last options seems the best, but is it possible or even desirable?
Eve manages it a little with its null sec sovereignity and corporations,
but at the expense of large-scale player-vs-player gameplay (which
brings its own problems). I suspect the far easier option is to just ban
RMT.</p>
