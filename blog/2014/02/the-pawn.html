<p>It has been some time since a restaurant review post. This is not
because there isn’t great food available in Malaysia. Quite the opposite
actually. It is just that most of the best places I have eaten here are
streetfood vendors or other places westerners may be hesitant to eat as
they look a little dingy. Also, while the dining is excellent, the
service is often lacking (to be polite) - the money is all on the plate,
or banana leaf. Not that meals cost much. There is a joke here that the
quality of a restaurant’s food is inversely proportional to the number
of walls it has (ceilings optional). There is even an informal rating
system from 0 walls (the best) to 4 walls (the worst). As in “this is a
good place, I award it 1 wall” or “ the food was awful - a four waller”.</p>

<p>I’m not sure the same system applies in Hong Kong. We had good and bad
streetfood, as well as good and bad food from restaurants. Although one
place particularly stands out: <a href="http://www.thepawn.com.hk/">The Pawn</a>.
Admittedly this serves British cuisine in an Asian country, but I can’t
remember the names of any of the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum">Dim
Sum</a> places (as they were largely
in Chinese characters), so I haven’t written about them. The original
intention was to try <a href="http://www.22ships.hk/">22 Ships</a> based on a
recommendation. Unfortunately, that place was full and had a waiting
list of at least an hour. Being too hungry to wait, a quick walk around
the corner led us to The Pawn.</p>

<p>Settling into the English pub decor and devouring the provided excellent
bread and oil (a rare sight in Malaysia), we perused the refreshingly
small number of menu options. I had the 24 hour pork belly and my
companion ordered the Wagyu steak, both sharing a side of “greens”. In
all restaurant ordering there is a winner - and this time it was
definitely not me. While the pork belly was very good and melted
pleasantly in my mouth, the steak was exceptional. Perfectly cooked, the
few bites I was allowed convinced me I had ordered badly - probably the
best steak I have tasted. We finished by inhaling a dark chocolate and
Guinness cake - also very tasty. Service was good (far, far better than
we have become accustomed). While at around HK$1000 (with a glass of
wine) it is an order of magnitude more expensive than Kuala Lumpur, it
roughly matches the UK gastro pubs it clearly aims to emulate.</p>

<p>Recommended.</p>
