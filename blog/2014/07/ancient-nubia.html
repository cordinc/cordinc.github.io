<p>The last online course completed in my recent burst of MOOC study was
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ancientnubia">Ancient Nubia</a> by <a href="http://www.emory.edu/">Emory
University</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. Ancient history courses are
dominated by Mediterranean cultures (at least the ones presented in the
English language). <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/tag/History.html">Ancient Greece and
Rome</a> are well represented
in online courses and podcasts. Thus opportunities to study other
ancient civilisations must be seized on the rare occasions they arise.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia">Nubia</a> is the region immediately
south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataracts_of_the_Nile">Nile’s first
cataract</a>, and
stretching down past the sixth cataract. In modern geography this is the
area between Egypt south of Aswan, and Sudan north of Khartoum.
Civilisation arose here soon after ancient Egypt, and there was
extensive interaction between the two. Trade had definitely commenced by
the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>
(as there are texts describing the commerce); Pharaoh’s during the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>
conquered various parts of Nubia; and, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt">New
Kingdom</a>, Nubian
kings returned the favour conquering Egypt in 760BC and forming the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_dynasty_of_Egypt">25<sup>th</sup>
Dynasty</a> - a
period known as the reign of the Black Pharaohs. Nubia was also
influenced by (and influenced) societies in central Africa and in it’s
later years by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum">Axum</a>.</p>

<p>Archaeologically, Nubia has received a great deal less attention than
it’s famous northern neighbour. However, when Egypt decided to build the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan_Dam">Aswan Dam</a> it became clear that
many Nubian ruins would disappear under the resulting lake. Numerous
studies were undertaken before the flooding, and since the Nubians
sometimes built in stone and had a written language, a great deal can be
determined about them.</p>

<p>This 8 week course is presented by Dr Peter Lacovara and covers the
history of Nubia from prehistorical beginnings until its decline around
the 3<sup>rd</sup> century AD. The course progresses chronologically and
is largely focussed on major events and archaeological artefacts. Each
week consists of around 30 minutes of video and a multiple choice test.
There is no exam. There is however a class participation requirement.
Posting in the forums every week on a set question is worth 5% of the
overall course mark. This forced participation may work well in small
classes, but in an online class of several hundred it just resulted in a
great deal of what essentially became little more than “me too” posts.
The first few had interesting information, but they soon decayed into a
waste of space. I avoided this part of the course.</p>

<p>The video lectures are mostly the presenter sitting down and talking to
the camera. Occasionally there are interviews, slides or short
documentary extracts. The lecturer seemed uncomfortable talking to the
camera, but was fine in interviews. Production quality is consistently
high.</p>

<p>A worthwhile, but basic, course on Nubia.</p>
