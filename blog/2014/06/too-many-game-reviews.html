<p>So many games. Between bundles, sales and miscellaneous sources, I seem
to have accumulated quite a pile. A quick calculation suggests I have
only played 10% of the games I own. Some I have peversely avoided
playing due to the time they take to play, assuming they are any good.
Thus various well reviewed strategy games and rpgs sit unloved in my
library. Meanwhile, I have played a few shorter titles recently, and
here are some equally short reviews.</p>

<p>When <a href="/blog/2012/02/game-reviews-again.html">starting to play games
again</a>, at first I finished all
of them. Now I am a bit more selective. A game has about an hour to
impress me to play on. Most games don’t reach this level and are quickly
deleted. Then another filter occurs a few hours in. Often I just drift
away from a game when it becomes too hard or I lose interest. Then there
are the few games I play to completion. Take that into account when
reading the reviews.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami"><img src="/assets/posts/games/hotline_miami.jpg" alt="Hotline Miami" title="Hotline Miami" /></a></p>

<!--more-->

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit.Trip_Runner">Bit Trip Runner</a></em> is a
running rhythm game. Your character runs across a scrolling screen
jumping and sliding out of the way of obstacles to a soundtrack
influenced by your actions (if you time your moves right the music
sounds better). All this in a retro arcade 8-bit graphic style. For me,
this game was too much a test of reaction time or pattern learning. It
wasn’t fun and I quit after around an hour - the game is seen as an
extraordinarily unforgiving title.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Miami">Hotline Miami</a></em> is
another game with retro 8-bit graphics, although this fits well with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Vice">Miami Vice</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive_(2011_film)">Driver</a>
inspired 80’s theme. It has been described as “a top-down f**’em-up”.
I can’t think of a better description. Stylish production, an excellent
soundtrack and fast play loop (death is but a short delay) mean I really
want to like this game. However, it is way too fast and twitchy for me.
I didn’t get very far into it and drifted away after a few hours. It
remains on my hard-drive maybe I’ll go back to it.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antichamber">Antichamber</a></em> is a well
regard first-person puzzle game, but I just didn’t get it. It starts
with the player dumped in the game with no idea what to do or why.
Moving through the rooms, it becomes clear the game is breaking the
rules of real-world geometry. However, unlike the far more satisfying
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)">Portal</a>
where just one thing is changed and then the possibilities explored,
Antichamber changes many, many things. It sometimes feels every puzzle
is based on a different unrelated idea. It felt like the game was just
trying to trick me. I couldn’t work out why I was playing, so I just
stopped.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/runespell.jpg" alt="Runespell Overture" title="Runespell Overture" /></p>

<p><em><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/102200/">Runespell Overture</a></em> is
not a game I expected to enjoy. It is a card based combat game. The
player fights a series of enemies by compiling poker hands from a never
ending solitaire-like setup. The tactics are enlivened by special power
cards that can be played instead of building hands. The only downside is
that it is quite a simple game and I was rarely troubled in my matches.
Still it is surprisingly enjoyable and doesn’t take too long, so I
finished it.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braid_(video_game)">Braid</a></em>
is an indie favorite platformer. It contains one new game mechanic - the
ability to rewind and replay time. I am not a fan of platform games and
Braid didn’t overcome that prejudice. The interesting mechanic kept me
going longer than I might otherwise. I fully completed the first 2 rooms
(out of 6), but became frustrated as it became hard to tell what was
going on. The tricks just seems too tricky. I watched some online play
videos and didn’t think it would get better for me, so I stopped.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guns_of_Icarus_Online">Guns of Icarus
Online</a></em> is an
online multiplayer game where the players take the part of crew members
on zeppelins fighting each other (the players can be gunners, pilots or
mechanics). Considering <a href="http://gunsoficarus.com/blog/guns-of-icarus-online-retrospective-part-i-publisher-hell/">the problems they
had</a>,
just releasing this game is a significant achievement for the
developers. It seemed interesting with a good idea and nice design, but
unfortunately it is online only. There is huge lag from where I live to
all the active games (the problem with not living in the first world).
It is not really playable for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_Space"><img src="/assets/posts/games/EndlessSpace.jpg" alt="Endless Space" title="Endless Space" /></a></p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endless_Space">Endless Space</a></em> was
recommended to me as a source of inspiration and ideas for <a href="www.concealedintent.com">Concealed
Intent</a> (especially the GUI). It is a
turn-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X_game">4x</a> strategy game set
in space. Initially it feels very similar to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(video_game)">Civilization</a>.
So at first I just concentrated on the GUI, which is indeed very pretty
and functional, expecting to delete it after playing. However, it is
still sitting on my hard drive. The game adds enough new mechanics to be
interesting in its own right. Most importantly it seems smaller and
quicker to play than most games in its genre. The games I have played
were complete in just 3-4 hours. Not an imposing amount of time and I
can definitely see myself playing a few more times.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cities_in_Motion_2">Cities in Motion 2</a></em>
is another game very similar to a more popular franchise; in this case
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a>. The point of
distinction is that in Cities in Motion the player just controls the
public transport system. It didn’t work for me and I found it hard to
control on my Mac (a disappointingly common problem). Deleted, while
SimCity 4 stays proudly on my desktop.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_the_Moon">To the Moon</a></em> was described
to me as “a game for girlfriends”. Well not my girlfriend - she didn’t
enjoy it. I didn’t like it either. It is an interesting idea. This is
hardly a game at all. More a slightly interactive story. It could work,
but the story would need to be good. Instead it is sentimental, not
particularly well written, slow and very long. At 4 hours it is a short
game, but a long movie (which seems like a better point of comparison to
me).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Pirates_and_Zombies">Space Pirates and Zombies
(SPAZ)</a></em> is a
top-down space shooter with elements of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">real-time
strategy</a> game. I’m not
a fan of top-down shooters and this one didn’t grab my attention in any
way. I stopped playing after an hour.</p>

<p><a href="http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/media"><img src="/assets/posts/games/Bastion.jpg" alt="Bastion" title="Bastion" /></a></p>

<p><em><a href="http://supergiantgames.com/index.php/media">Bastion</a></em> - I saved the
best for last. This game is a little slice of near perfection. It is a
top-down RPG like <a href="/blog/2014/01/game-reviews.html">Torchlight</a>. The
style is different and interesting. You play largely on floating
platforms and walkways with the floor floating up to form the structure
as you reach the edge of the current play area. Still falling off is a
common occurrence and handled with a minor health loss. The graphics are
pretty, the music is excellent, the voice over work top-notch and the
story decent (which means by computer game standards it is excellent!).
The top-down RPG seems to be an addictive form of game for me - playing
this game was certainly an enjoyable experience. Highly recommended.</p>
