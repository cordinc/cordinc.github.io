<p>The previous astronomy MOOC I completed, <a href="/blog/2014/06/anu-astro1x.html">ANU-ASTRO1x Greatest Unsolved
Mysteries of the Universe</a>, was merely
the first of a series. In total, the 4 courses in the series supposedly
comprise the first year course in astronomy at the <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National
University</a>. I just completed the second course
of the series, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/anux/anux-anu-astro2x-exoplanets-1443">ANU-ASTRO2x
Exoplanets</a>.</p>

<p>Exoplanets is a 9-week course on the science behind detecting planets
beyond our solar system. The format is the same as the previous course,
with about an hour per week of video lectures. There are also mini-tests
and a homework assignment each week with a final exam. The exam is again
based on a “mystery” universe, so prior knowledge of exoplanets (or
wikipedia) won’t help - students just have to do the maths themselves.
The lectures are almost a conversational back-and-forth between the
presenters <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/pfrancis/">Paul Francis</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schmidt">Brian Schmidt</a> (with
pictures and notes appearing projected behind them).</p>

<p>As for difficulty, this course is easy. Easier than the previous ANU
course. Basic algebra is all the maths ability required. No assignment
took me more than 30 minutes, most took much less. I read an
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/11/the-mooc-revolution-that-wasnt/">article</a>
suggesting that the “MOOC revolution” is failing for many reasons, one
of which is that the courses are getting easier and certainly are no
where near as testing as the original university courses. I can’t help
but think that must be true for this course. The material is
interesting, but I would find it hard to believe that first year science
students at a respected university like ANU (one of the top tier
universities in Australia) are gifted with such an easy course where a
mark of 100% can be obtained with barely an hour of work each week.</p>

<p>Starting with the first exoplanet discovered, surprisingly around a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar_planet">pulsar</a>, the course goes
through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets">methods used to find
exoplanets</a>.
The pulsar planet was found through reflex motion - a wiggle in a star’s
movement caused by a planet’s mass. Most exoplanets have been found
through transits, that is the periodic dimming of a star as a planet
passes between it and us. It is also possible to find exoplanets with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing">gravitational
micro-lensing</a>,
which is when a planet passes in front of a star and focuses its light
on us. This method is has the benefit of finding planets that are not
orbiting stars but are instead free floating. The downside is that such
planets can only be observed once (as they pass the star). Still, the
number of discovered micro-lensing events suggests there are a large
number of such free-floating planets in existence. Lastly it is becoming
possible to directly observe exoplanets with modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics">adaptive
optics</a> technology applied
to telescopes. The course also addresses what is known about the
exoplanets discovered - calculating their mass, temperature and thus the
composition of both their atmosphere and surface.</p>

<p>An easy and interesting discussion of the current state of detecting
exoplanets. However, the field of exoplanet detection is very active and
fast moving. I’m not sure how quickly this course will age.</p>
