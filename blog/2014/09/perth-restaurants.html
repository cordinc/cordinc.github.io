<p>When I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth">Perth</a> the
supermarkets always had good and relatively cheap food available.
However, I remember the local restaurants seemed to lack effort as far
as the menu was concerned (good service was never an issue). It was as
though they just relied on the high quality ingredients to carry them.
Coming back to town after 13 years abroad, I think that situation has
changed. We ate excellent meals everywhere we went, and the range of
styles available was impressive. Perth is becoming a world city, at
least as far as cuisine is concerned. It was also nice that all but two
of the restaurants we visited (over a fortnight) had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_fresco_dining">Al
fresco</a> sections -
unfortunately the weather was a bit damp for us to take proper advantage
of them. I also noted with interest that most restaurants listed the
providence of their ingredients and that the vast majority of these
originated inside West Australia itself - overseas elements were notable
in their rarity.</p>

<p>While in Perth, two restaurants in stood out as being of a particularly
high quality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lot20.co">Lot 20</a> is almost hidden in a building on the edge
of the cultural district near James St in Northbridge. The decor is
modern gastropub. The service was very friendly without being too much.
When asking about <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/12471/soninlaw-eggs">son-in-law
eggs</a>, the reply
not only included the recipe, but also their cultural significance (a
Thai dish made as warning to behave to a new son-in-law). After ordering
the eggs, asparagus, cauliflower and a chicken dish, we got to watch
them being prepared in the open kitchen which our table overlooked. All
the food was excellent and perfectly cooked. The chicken deserves
special mention. At first I thought it had been undercooked, but an
exploratory taste showed I was completely wrong. It had been cooked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide">in
a water bath</a> to keep it moist
and tender - incredible. We also drank some excellent local beers. I
used to say that beer, chocolate and TV were all clearly better in
London. Now I will have say that the beer (and perhaps chocolate) are
about the same - TV in Britain is still better though.</p>

<p>When I lived in Perth, Steve’s on the river in Nedlands was a large
student pub (<a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au">UWA</a> is nearby). Since then the pub
has been demolished and turned into fancy apartments. However, there is
still a restaurant and wine shop at the site, still called
<a href="http://www.steves.com.au">Steve’s</a>. Wine is a large focus of the
restaurant and there is a dedicated sommelier as well as a large
selection of local wines. The cuisine is vaguely French inspired. For an
entree I had a chorizo soup - a spicy meaty mix, well balanced and not
oily. Then the pork cassoulet with a side salad for mains. Beautifully
cooked, it quickly filled my stomach, but I kept eating until finished -
it was too good to leave anything behind. The wine was also very good,
but I don’t remember what we ordered.</p>
