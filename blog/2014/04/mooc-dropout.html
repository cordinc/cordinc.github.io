<h4>MOOC Dropout</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>I have dropped out of my first
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a>, the
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ggp">General Game Playing</a> course from
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. Having completed half the 8 week
course with a score of 100%, it would be easy to continue. However, the
course is not interesting enough to justify the effort required.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing">General Game Playing
(GGP)</a> involves
creating computer programs that can compete in multiple, previously
unseen games. These games can be single-player or multi-player; have
perfect or imperfect information; and may be competitive or cooperative.
The resulting players must be able to handle all games without any
internal changes, so are closer to the ideal of generalised
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_artificial_intelligence">AI</a>
than the very narrowly focused computations used in traditional players
like the Chess-only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep
Blue</a>. The
games are specified in a logic-based language. A Java library is
available to implement the basics of the client/server game playing
protocol and parsing game messages (including the game specification).</p>

<p>Each week the course covers some aspect of writing the players with
30-60 minutes of video - mostly the content of these involve running
through a couple of chapters from the lecturer’s textbook. Every week
there are multiple assignments - some as online tests, while others
require programming. By the end of the course each student will have
created a player they enter into a competition against the other
students’ work. The resulting ranking feeding into the overall grade,
although the details were not available by the time I quit.</p>

<p>To me the course seemed to be mainly teaching their “system” (that is,
the game specification and protocol). A few useful ideas are presented,
for instance Propnets and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo
simulation</a>. Although,
I had already covered most of these techniques previously. It was like
doing a work course on MS Office or some other proprietary technology.
The course is not worth the time, unless practice in formal logic and
related optimisation techniques is needed.</p>

<p>So I unenrolled and it has disappeared from my course history. This
seems to be a common event. Another recent online course advertised that
it dropped 80% of its students over the first two weeks - apparently a
good result! I haven’t given up on online courses. Right now I’m halfway
through 2 other, more compelling courses (another reason to free up time
by quitting this one), with another starting in a fortnight. Being able
to easily unenroll is a benefit of MOOCs. This way there is no barrier
to give giving one a try. If it doesn’t work out, just stop. Of course
now I’ve quit one, it will probably easy to quit again!</p>
