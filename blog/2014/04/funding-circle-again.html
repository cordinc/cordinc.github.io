<p>As it now seems to be an
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/04/funding-circle-update.html">annual</a>
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/06/funding-circle.html">tradition</a>,
here is my end-of-financial year report on <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding
Circle</a>. The peer-to-peer website has
certainly flourished over the past 12 months. Many positive stories
about the site and its competitors have appeared in the popular press.
The volume of loans available has greatly increased. Right now 66 loans
are available for funding, and that is lower than a normal day. The
increase in loans does not seem to be matched by an increase in lenders
(despite the <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/about-us/our-blog/government-to-start-lending-to-businesses-through-funding-circle">government
joining</a>).
Thus interest rates have been increasing over the last few months. Has
this translated into better returns, or has financial stress created
more bad debts?</p>

<p>After last year’s disappointing ~2% return, no extra money was
deposited, so the maths for this year’s return is easy to calculate.
Here is the summary.</p>

<p>Gross: 8.4%<br />
After Fees: 7.4%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 4.1%</p>

<p>Much better than last year.</p>

<p>Interestingly the gross and after-fees returns are roughly the same as
last year. Any increase in rates has come too late to make much of an
impact on the full year results. The improved return is largely due to
net bad debt. The rate at which loans goes bad has only decreased a
little - just under 5% this year by value, compared to just over 5% last
year. However, this year debt recovery has added 1.6% to the return,
compared to 0 last year. The recovery process is slow and these extra
returns are mainly from last years losses.</p>

<p>Funding Circle now claims I have a return of 4.3. Much closer to my
figures than last year. Although, they have added a note to the figure
stating it is the annualised return since joining the site. This seems
about right, so I’m no longer concerned by the discrepancy. The site
also claims I should be earning 5.8, so again my bad debt rate is higher
than “normal”. I made a conscious decision to have a slightly higher
than average risk profile on my loans (by lending to firms with a
slightly worse than average credit rating). Even taking this into
account, according to Funding Circle’s own numbers, I have bad luck.
This is surprising considering how steady bad debt has been over the
last two years. Will it even out next year, or is 5% about the right
rate of deliquency?</p>

<p>What next? For various reasons not related to performance, no extra
money will be deposited. Nor will any money be withdrawn - I’m more
comfortable how the system is working, and it is still better than a
bank. So until next year the status quo will continue.</p>
