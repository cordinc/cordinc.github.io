<h4>Converting computer gold to real money</h4>

<p>Some months ago I posted about <a href="/blog/2013/11/computer-gold-rush.html">mining
cryptocurrencies</a>, concluding
that it probably wasn’t worth it. Since then
<a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has boomed and then bust, with
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26446142">theft</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox">bankruptices</a> and possible
regulation galore. Despite the volatility and bad press, Bitcoin has
doubled in value since the original post (although at one point it was
up over 500%). Other, minor, cryptocurrencies have oscillated in value
roughly in line with Bitcoin.</p>

<p>In the original post I estimated that if my desktop PC mined
<a href="http://feathercoin.com/">Feathercoin</a> for 100 days the result would be
224 FTC worth US$15.68 (7 cents per FTC). I left the mining program
running after the “experiment” ended as it didn’t seem to noticably slow
the computer. So now 150 days later the result is 180 FTC currently
worth around US$21 (11.5 cents per FTC). The lower mining rate is due to
not being a particularly conscientious miner and the ever increasing
difficulty of the calculations required to mine successfully.</p>

<p>So what can be done with $20 worth of Feathercoin? Initially it seemed,
very little. There is a <a href="https://feathercoinmarket.com/">Feathercoin
Market</a> of seemingly random items - none
of which interested me. Next I hoped to convert the coins to US$. I
found <a href="https://crypto-trade.com/">Crypto-Trade</a>, an exchange based in
Hong Kong that allowed FTC/USD trades and didn’t charge excessive fees.
Unfortunately, it also doesn’t have any useful cash withdrawal options.
While it is easy and cheap to withdraw various cryptocurrencies, cash
can not transferred to a bank account or even Paypal. It has to be taken
in the form of various east european e-payment systems. Not even the
online poker sites I use would accept them. I looked into methods of
conversion and found various sites charging 5-10% to exchange them for
Paypal, but every single one has pages full of “this is a scam!”
warnings on Google. I then considered converting the Feathercoins for
Bitcoins (or Litecoin) and then using other larger exchanges to get US$
transferred to Paypal. However, the fees for this route would turn my
$20 into less than the minimum transfer amount of $10! Next I looked
into converting the coins to Bitcoin and purchasing Amazon vouchers with
them. Many sites exist to facilitate such transfers. Unfortunately, only
US$ vouchers are available and Amazon has strict policies against non-US
people (like me) using them. Urgh.</p>

<p>At this point the situation was dire, much time had been spent on a
futile investigation of Feathercoin’s utility. The whole system seems a
little “wild west”, with high percentage fees, scams and frauds common.
It is definitely much easier to get money into Bitcoin than the
opposite. I certainly doubt the value of the system as a currency.
Although it has prompted an explosion of witty aphorisms. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dunning-krugerrand">Dunning
Krugerrand</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Pocius/status/435568115791826945">this
tweet</a> are my
favourites.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to write the whole thing off as a folly, I found
<a href="http://www.cryptodechange.com/">Crypto-de-Change</a>, as site that
converts cryptocurrencies for UK Amazon vouchers. I exchanged 161 FTC
for a £10 voucher (about 10.5 cents per FTC). At least there is some
result, but now I am more skeptical than ever. I used the voucher to buy
a book by Charlie Stross - <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html">it seemed
appropriate</a>.</p>
