<p>On first arrival in <a href="/blog/2012/12/kuala-lumpur-1.html">Kuala Lumpur</a> we
stayed in the housing within the British High Commission compound. This
was intended as a short-term measure while a permanent home was found.
However, for various reasons we stayed there for just over a year. The
final trigger to leave was the sale of the compound itself (otherwise we
might still be there). Soon the compound site will be redeveloped.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Kuala+Lumpur,+Federal+Territory+of+Kuala+Lumpur/@3.1594856,101.72192,276m/data=![](3m1)1e3![](4m2)3m1!1s0x31cc49c701efeae7:0xf4d98e5b2f1c287d"><img src="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/satellite.png" alt="Satellite view of the compound" title="Satellite view of the compound" /></a></p>

<p>There is a <a href="/slideshows/kl_compound.html">slideshow of some photos taken just before leaving
here</a>. Or, read on for some more details.</p>

<p>The staff relocated in September. Between then and moving out in
December it was just 3 people in the housing and the 24-hour guards. An
eerily quite oasis in the middle of bustling KL. A few weeks after we
left, the site was handed over to the developers. It is a bit of a
shame. I doubt the UK will ever have enough space for a compound in KL
again - which infers more status than a open plan office in an office
tower. Still, the rumours are that the UK government received a huge
amount of money for prime city real estate. It would have been hard to
refuse, especially since the grounds weren’t being used to full
capacity.</p>

<p>We lived in House 6, a very nice 2-bed apartment over two floors. Very
spacious by London standards, but I think fairly normal for central KL.
Unusually for central KL we had a little backyard area. This greenery
was very much appreciated. Although on my first night (during the rainy
season) I thought there may be a problem as the yard became a lake. With
experience, I soon learnt this was no concern - it flooded all the time
and safely drained away. The garden also had some wildlife. Various
insects were ubiquitous. Birds would use the nearby pool (rarely used by
humans) for drinking water. There were regular sightings of frogs,
lizards, squirrels (my favourite) and the occasional cat. We discovered
that squirrels loved oranges. It was the only way to get them to stay
still long enough for a photo.</p>

<p>Over the road, the French Embassy has a wilder garden with a lake and
more wildlife (including monkeys). However, they also have a chronic
mosquito problem. They also can’t build large structures on most of the
property as it was previously a tin mine (and is thus less appealing to
developers).</p>

<p>Between the housing and the High Commission itself was the Elizabeth
Club building (normally shortened to the E-club). It was the setting for
the commission’s social activities and thus primarily used as a bar (and
irregular karaoke lounge). Every Thursday night, and some Fridays, a
volunteer staff member would go behind the bar and sell the “cheapest
beer in KL” (as there was no tax on it). The club also had a pool,
tennis court, squash court, pool table and a full size snooker table,
but these weren’t used nearly as often. The snooker table is notable as
it was from the old High Commissioner’s residence at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carcosa_Seri_Negara">Carcosa</a>. It
definitely dated from before WWII, as it was known to have been captured
and used by occupying Japanese forces. I not sure what happened to it
with the move - it was certainly too big for the new office or High
Commissioner’s residence.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/e-club.jpg"><img src="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/e-club_main.jpg" title="E-club" width="240" alt="E-club" /></a>
<a href="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/e-club_inside.jpg"><img src="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/e-club_inside_main.jpg" title="Inside the E-club" width="240" alt="Inside the E-club" /></a></p>

<p>Without security access to the High Commission itself, I couldn’t take
any photos of the old office and the outside is nondescript. The
compound does come with all the usual mod-cons: power generator, huge
underground carpark/storage area, bomb-proof letter opening hut (yes, a
specific and separate building for checking mail) and a standoff zone.
The latter is a secure area anyone wishing to enter the compound must
pass through. Looking at the photo of the front gate below, you will see
that there are two sets of gates and fences. To enter the compound, a
visitor passes through the first gate (which is closed behind them), and
is checked again before passing the second. In the photo you can also
just see the gates to the French embassy directly opposite. As far as I
could tell the copious storage areas were used to store furniture (as
were a couple of the unoccupied compound houses). The High Commission
provides furniture for its expats. As the number of staff shrunk and as
people requested/needed new items the unused amount just increased.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/front_gate.jpg"><img src="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/front_gate_main.jpg" title="Front gate" width="240" alt="Front gate" /></a></p>

<p>Cheap untaxed alcohol was not only available at the E-club. The compound
also had a commissariat, open for one hour per week (with only alcohol
for sale!). It was located at the opposite end of the housing building
to us, it was known as the “comm”. Every few months a new shipment would
arrive and all the beer and wine would disappear a few weeks before the
next one. Spirits were less popular. I believe this system is unusual
among the embassies. All get tax-free alcohol (the benefit of diplomatic
status and buildings), but rather than run a small store and bar, they
use a bulk mail order system instead (often joining together the orders
from several embassies/commissions). The comm is gone now and UK staff
use the standard mail order system. Directly above the comm was the
prayer room, used mainly by the guards and the armed police stationed
outside the gates.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/comm.jpg"><img src="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/comm_main.jpg" title="Commissariat" width="240" alt="Commissariat" /></a>
<a href="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/overlooked.jpg"><img src="/assets/slideshow/kl_compound/overlooked_main.jpg" title="Towers overlooking the compound" width="240" alt="Towers overlooking the compound" /></a></p>

<p>By the time of leaving the compound was overlooked by towers in all
directions. More are rising. It is clear the land must be valuable.
Although one staff member said that when they mentioned the move to an
official from another embassy, they asked in hushed tones “is it because
you are overlooked?” Apparently having tall buildings next door is
considered a security concern. At the telling of that story the loudest
laugh came from a manager at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huawei#Security_concerns">Huawei</a> which
has an office overlooking the compound (at the time they were drinking
at the E-club). Still, money seems a more likely explanation for the
move.</p>
