<p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ancient-world/id517589332">iTunes</a>
and on the blog, <a href="http://ancientworldpodcast.blogspot.com/">The Ancient
World</a></p>

<p>This history podcast originally aimed to cover all history from the
earliest civilizations until the start of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_antiquity">classical
age</a> (around 500BC).
The presenter, Scott Chesworth, just thought such a history was required
and couldn’t find one - so did it himself. The series covers a great
deal of material over its 36 audio-only episodes (each around half an
hour in length and of good production quality). An ambitious
undertaking.</p>

<p>The podcast starts with the invention of irrigation and the formation of
the first cities in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer">Sumer</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elam">Elam</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt">Egypt</a>. The next couple of
episodes carry on with the beginnings of civilization in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">Harappa</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_china#Ancient_China">China</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization">Crete</a>. There is also
mention of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norte_Chico_civilization">Norte
Chico</a> in Peru,
the oldest known American civilisation, and new to me. However, after
that the series focuses almost exclusively on the well documented
history of the ancient Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean. This is
largely due to much of the history of these areas surviving through to
the present day on stone monuments and clay tablets. Scott admits as
much in the final episode, stating he couldn’t find enough details on
individuals or events in other areas to make it entertaining and fit it
with the style of the show. This means that iron age
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan">Canaan</a> (as covered extensively in
the Bible and researched by Bible-historians) is described in far more
detail than China and India combined. Similarly when discussing the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achaemenid_Empire">Persians</a> most
information is on their dealings with other civilisations, while their
interactions with Central Asian societies is largely unknown.</p>

<p>The podcasts run in roughly chronological order. A particular region at
a particular time will be presented. Followed by another region
overlapping in both time and geography. It can become a bit of a
tick-tock of events and people. This perhaps to be expected given the
breadth of material to be covered, and that most of it comes from kings
extolling their personal exploits. There is not much indication of how
things worked or how life was lived at the time. Occasionally some
details come through, like the discussion of the diplomatic letters
traded between kings just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_age_collapse">bronze age
collapse</a> showing the
ancient world to be very well connected. Scott livens up the flow of
facts when he can with little asides or appeals to modern sensitivities.
Thus the Minoans are “awesome” partly for having no discernable
military; a particularly cruel act is “positively
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria">Assyrian</a>”; and the faux-credulous
manner when retelling the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_I#Accession">Darius I’s accession to the Persian
throne</a>. It was also
interesting to hear how large the Persian Empire became under Darius
(perhaps 45% of the world’s population) and how it was run in a tolerant
manner with the local customs and sometimes even the leadership of a
province (known as a satrapy) remaining unchanged.</p>

<p>While it might not achieve its lofty goal (as explained below), this
series does provide a great deal of information on an underrepresented
period of history (online at least). Not many other podcasts will
describe ancient Sumer,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_Empire">Akkad</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitanni">Mittani</a>. It is definitely worth
a listen, and thanks Scott for filling the gap.</p>
