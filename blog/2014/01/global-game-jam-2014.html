<p>This past weekend I took part in the <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game
Jam</a> here in Kuala Lumpur. At over 480
locations around the world, people got together in small teams to create
a game from scratch in 48 hours. With Yang and Kyle, we created
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/gripversion">Gripversion</a>, a simple
puzzle game. The game requires the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift">Occulus
Rift</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razer_Hydra">Razor
Hydra</a> to create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">virtual
reality</a> experience. Here
is a video of a tester playing the second level of the final game. On
this level the hands are inverted (the left controller moves the right
hand and vice versa). The aim is to pick up the red box and drop it
through the hoop.</p>

<p>Turning up at the jam I was quite nervous. I had attended the <a href="/blog/2013/01/ggj13-in-kl.html">final
presentation of the 2013 jam</a> and it
seemed like fun. So here I was for the next one, but having no idea how
most of the weekend would work. I also seemed to be the oldest
participant by at least 10 years. However, everyone was incredibly
friendly and the weekend was well organised, so there was no need for
concern.</p>

<p>The jam was held in the library at <a href="http://www.kdu.edu.my/">KDU</a>, which
offers <a href="http://www.kdu.edu.my/programmes/game-development.html">game development
courses</a>. It was
a large open space with lots of desks and comfy chairs. The organisers
were lecturers from the university and the vast majority of jammers were
students or the recently graduated. During daylight hours there were
also around 30-40 high school students participating in a game
development bootcamp where they learnt the basic of creating games in
organised lectures and lab sessions. A great idea and also a great
source of testers!</p>

<p>The jam started at 5pm with the recorded keynotes. Their message
basically boiled down to write games that are different and emotional.
Then came the theme for our games, “we don’t see things as they are, we
see them as we are.” My mind went blank. We had an hour or so to come up
with ideas before all going out to dinner together. My best idea was a
sort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rorschach_test">Rorschach</a> inkblot
guessing game, described by the person sitting next to me as “definitely
a programmer’s idea.”</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj14/DSCF4017.JPG"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj14/DSCF4017.JPG" title="Ideas" width="550" alt="Ideas" /></a></p>

<p>After dinner we formed teams. Unfortunately, as most of the jammers
already knew each other, they came with preformed teams (against what
I’m told is the spirit of the event). To stop preformed teams using
preformed games, all such groups had to use a <a href="http://videogamena.me/">generated name for their
game</a> (try it!). Thus, with much hilarity we
were promised games such as <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/fabulous-donkey-fiasco">Fabulous Donkey
Fiaso</a>,
<a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/panzer-surgery-invaders">Panzer Surgery
Invaders</a>,
and <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/mystic-gopher-posse">Mystic Gopher
Posse</a>. The
remaining twenty or so people without a group then pitched their ideas.
In another diversion from normal jam procedure (so I’m told) the group
voted on which ideas should be developed. There were only 6 programmers
left (including me) so the organisers declared only 3 of the ideas would
be pursued. Above is a photo of some of the ideas. The little blue and
green stickers are the votes.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj14/DSCF4019.JPG"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj14/DSCF4019.JPG" title="Original Gripversion idea and team list" width="350" alt="Original Gripversion idea and team list" /></a></p>

<p>My idea was one of two (out of 18 ideas in total) that got no votes
(next goal: <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2940682.stm">representing Britain in
Eurovision</a>). So I went for the
next most interesting “programmer” idea - Gripversion (above). One of
the jammers, Yang, brought along an Occulus Rift and Razor Hydra, but
had yet to code anything for them. The link to the theme was that we
would play with the inputs (reversing hands, changing rotation axes) and
outputs so that the player had to overcome their natural intuition (for
instance, that their left hand was actually their right hand in the
game). Tenuous perhaps, but more obvious than the links many of the
other ideas claimed.</p>

<p>Thus the teams were formed around 11:30pm on the first night - nearly an
eighth into the whole event. As people were already beginning to slow
down ad get tired, it was clear ambitions would have to be kept limited.
It also became clear that with no experience in Rift and Hydra
programming, just setting up a simple environment would take some time.
It further transpired we didn’t even have the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">programming
APIs</a> to
interact with the devices. At the speed of the local net connection -
just downloading them would take a couple of hours. Programming was
obviously going to be the choke point, so I got to work. We used
<a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a>, so I was ready to go from the start.
About half the games used Unity, the other half used
<a href="http://www.stencyl.com/">Stencyl</a>.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj14/DSCF4047.JPG"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj14/DSCF4047.JPG" title="Neon Surf Bandit" width="550" alt="Neon Surf Bandit" /></a></p>

<p>Initially the team had a good spread of programmers, artists and
designers. However, as the coding work mounted the artists had
increasingly less opportunity to express themselves. By the start of the
second day it was clear they would be better off in another team. So
they started another game using the generated name <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/2014/games/neon-surf-bandit">Neon Surf
Bandit</a> and
completed it in under 30 hours (photo above).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/ggj14/DSCF4041.JPG"><img src="/assets/posts/ggj14/DSCF4041.JPG" title="The Gripversion team, and some testers" width="550" alt="The Gripversion team, and some testers" /></a></p>

<p>Now down to a team of just three programmers and no artists, development
became problematic. There was often only one person by themselves, the
others off eating, sleeping or showering. Or dealing with the steady
stream of people interested in trying out the Rift (Yang had a copy of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surgeon_Simulator_2013">Surgeon Simulator</a>
ready for these demos). I handled the Hydra work (reversing inputs etc),
picking up objects in the scene and the 5 levels we created (placing
objects and checking completion conditions). Others handled the
collision detection and setting up the Rift. The result, while basic,
worked as expected. There was always a line of people wanting to test it
and they all had positive remarks afterwards. Although we were unsure
how much of that was just the novelty of a VR environment - the most
common question after a demo was “how much does an Occulus Rift cost?”
Players were a little confused by the input inversions, but in a
puzzling manner rather than as an annoyance - which counts as success.
Interestingly people overcame the puzzles quicker when using the Rift
than when just watching it on a normal screen. We think that was to do
with the extra depth perception the Rift affords.</p>

<p>I managed 9 hours total sleep over the jam period, but less than an hour
of that on the first night. Bringing pillows, eyemasks and earplugs are
clearly signs of game jam experience. The second night I headed to a
quiet corner before the rush. In the photo below, my sleeping spot is on
the red &amp; white cushions in the far corner. I particularly like the
fortress of solitude one jammer created by placing inverted chairs ontop
of normal chairs - someone is in there!</p>

<p>While at points I found the process extremely frustrating, in the end it
was a positive experience. I hope to attend again next year. The plan
will be to join a large team with many artists on a more “traditional”
idea.</p>
