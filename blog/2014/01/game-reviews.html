<p>It has been some time since I last wrote about <a href="/blog/tag/Games.html">playing computer
games</a>. Largely because I have been trying to
write games rather than play them. Still over the last year I have
played a few and here are my thoughts.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torchlight">Torchlight</a></em> is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_role-playing_game">action
RPG</a> from a few
years ago. It is the first of its genre I have played and found it
initially very fun. As a player you go around fighting monsters, looting
the dungeon and becoming more powerful, thus gaining more impressive
abilities (at least graphically) as a result. The levelling up mechanic
and the missions seem to be the only RPG-like component - all the better
to gamify the player I suppose. Over time the game becomes a button
mashing exercise. Beating the final boss was just a matter of spamming
the same 4 buttons repetitively for about 5 minutes. I blame the
diminishing levels of fun on the paper-thin story - not nearly strong
enough to grab me (as opposed to
<a href="/blog/2012/08/more-games.html">Witcher</a> which had enough decent story
to happily drive me through the button mashing). Torchlight required
conscious effort to reach the end of story. Then I just stopped.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.playconclave.com/">Conclave</a></em> is a browser-based HTML5
RPG. I played the beta after accidently backing it on
<a href="blog/2013/11/kickstarter-report.html">Kickstarter</a>. Actually I played
through all the available quests twice - once when first backed and
again nearer the release. It improved greatly over that time. It is
quite pretty for a HTML game and more polished than before, but it is
also much easier. Originally a player needed to join other players to
complete quests (in a cooperative mode) and success was not guaranteed.
Now it can be played solo - the difficulty scaled to player. The second
time through I never failed any quest - it has become quite easy. The
quests mainly involve fighting with a few multi-choice story decisions
(but it was never clear what affect these decisions had, if any). The
turn-based combat becomes repetitive as the appropriate action is
normally obvious. The players choose two actions (from a character
specific list) and then those actions play out with their opponents’
actions. I didn’t find the story very interesting - there is a sort of
gothic horror dreaming in a traditional fantasy setting. Now the game is
available to the public (with the first 10 missions free), but I haven’t
played it again. Still it is worth a try (as it’s free).</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.cardhunter.com/">Cardhunter</a></em> is a similar brower-based
game to Conclave, but uses
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash">Flash</a> rather than just HTML.
Cardhunter is partially free (many quests are free, but there are extras
that must be purchased). It is very pretty and polished. It has a nice
little meta story. You are an old-school gamer playing some traditional
fantasy tabletop RPG controlling the actions of your party, while the
computer plays the part of the game master. Thus all the graphics try to
look like a tabletop: the characters are folded player models; there are
dice; and, the in-game currency is pizza! There is no real story beyond
this and the game is all about fighting. However, a little extra is
added to the turn-based combat through cards. To perform any action, a
character must have a card for that action - moving, attacking,
spellcasting, or anything else. The cards come from the level of the
character and their equipment (all their cards together are their
“deck”). Only a small number of a character’s cards are available to
play at any point (their “hand”) and once played they are lost until the
next combat, but replaced at random by other cards in their deck. So the
combat tactics are enhanced with deck-building strategy. Interesting and
fun.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTL:_Faster_Than_Light">FTL</a></em> is hard to
describe. You control a Federation space ship trying to escape rebels.
Jumping into a star system will trigger a random encounter, ranging from
pirates and rebels to markets and SOS beacons, or sometimes (although
rarely) just empty space. The ships are shown in top down plan and when
firing the player targets particular rooms. The effect is slightly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelike</a> and extremely
compelling. Like <a href="/blog/2012/09/small-games.html">Binding of Isaac</a> this
simple little game soon becomes fiendishly difficult. Yet as each game
is over fast you are always thinking “just one more”. FTL is highly
recommended and remains on my desktop for the occasional game.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.introversion.co.uk/uplink/">Uplink</a></em> is an old (released
in 2001) computer hacking simulation game. It is set in 2010, so it is a
game of future past. While a hacking game is an interesting idea, the
game is showing its age and felt repetitive. The process of hacking is
one of making a convoluted connection to the target machine and then
running your security cracking programs before you are traced. Not much
thought is required once the system is identified, it is just a matter
of improving your server until it is capable to hacking fast enough for
your desired target.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.mikebithellgames.com/thomaswasalone/">Thomas Was Alone</a></em>
is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_game">platformer</a>, not the
sort of game I would normally enjoy. However, this cute game is the
exception. It seems good-natured for a platform game, the difficulty
ramps up slowly. It is not punishing like most of the genre. While the
graphics are simple, the camera and animations are just right. I
particularly like the way the view was occasional off-angle. While fast
reactions are sometimes necessary, there is also a good amount of
thinking required. The game contains a number of different characters
each with various abilities (or lack thereof) and many levels need to be
thought through as puzzles to solve with the provided characters. The
story is not important in the game, but told in a humorous manner.
Recommended.</p>
