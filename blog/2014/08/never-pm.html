<h4>I Will Never Be Prime Minister</h4>

<p>Young kids today - embarrassing themselves all over the Internet with
their ill-advised photos! They will never be able to obtain high public
office! Of course, I think the only difference between the current and
previous generations is in the wide availability of evidence of their
indiscretions after the fact. There exists (or at least used to exist 20
years ago) a photo of me, which I think is understandable, but with a
bit of spin in the media would stop me becoming Prime Minister. Let me
explain.</p>

<p>During my 4th year at university I lived in a student house (I was 20).
There were four of us in a large house on Vincent Street opposite Hyde
Park in Mount Lawley. Besides me, there was a just-graduated accountant,
a med student who seemed to spend most of his time partying, an artist
and normally a random person or two crashing on our sofa. The artist was
an interesting guy - a Thai orphan raised in Australia. Much of his art
focused on satirising the military. We had a series of paintings around
the house of Godzilla sized cartoonish characters in military uniforms
(usually from World War 2) rampaging through cities or battlefields.
Right outside my bedroom door was a giant Goofy-like character throwing
tanks around. He also had an original 9 foot Nazi Swastika flag in his
bedroom (the house had very high ceilings).</p>

<p>I have met a few overt racists in my time, and this artist was
definitely not one of them. If he was harbouring any fascist tendencies
they were very well hidden. He claimed to be interested in the art of
Nazi Germany and so collected artefacts from that time. Kind of like
admiring the films of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl">Leni
Riefenstahl</a> while
ignoring their propagandistic purpose. He had a few other items as well,
but tended to buy them, hold onto them for a few months (taking photos
and drawing them) and then sell them to fund new items. While we were in
the same house he sold a SS dagger to buy an original
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> uniform jacket. This
is where I join the story.</p>

<p>He normally took photos with a blue-eyed blond-haired friend modelling
the items he bought. The artist never appeared in the photos himself as
he said he didn’t fit, being a dark-skinned South-east Asian. However,
the Luftwaffe jacket would not fit his friend - it was very small. At
the time I did a lot of long distance cycling and was quite small
myself. At just over 5’9” and just under 59kg, I was borderline
underweight according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">Body mass
Index</a>. Also I have
blue-eyes and, at the time, had sun-blonde hair. So the artist asked me
to put it on and I thought “why not?”</p>

<p>That jacket was small. The length was about right for me, maybe it was
for someone an inch or two shorter. Still, I could barely do up one
button. I was forbidden from trying a second in case I ripped it. It was
uncomfortably tight across the shoulders and chest. Whoever wore this
originally was very small - either they were a young teenager or
undernourished (or both!). The artist said it dated from 1944, towards
the end of the war. I guess by that stage Germany was desperate for
manpower and pressed anyone they could into service. It was also made of
poor material. It felt like a Hessian sack, very rough to touch. Again,
this is apparently not unusual for uniforms from that time (as times
were tough). Lastly, the jacked had a small rip just below my last left
rib. Was it a bullet hole, or just an accident from sometime during the
50 years since its manufacture? We didn’t know and there was no mention
of it in the accompanying documentation.</p>

<p>Then two photos were taken and my career in public office finished
before it began. Or probably not. Those photos are 20 years old now. I
look quite different (no hair and much heavier for a start!). I never
saw the result. I don’t even know if they were actually developed (this
being before digital cameras) or if they still exist. However, I learnt
more about the conditions at the end of the war in those few minutes
wearing that jacket than in my high school education (or various
jingoistic war movies). I feel great pity for the poor boy who wore that
same jacket half a century before me. I can’t say I regret it.</p>
