  <div class="content">
    <p>Right now I am quite happy I did not write the standard January blog post about my goals for the year. It would have been quickly completely out of date. I can not claim any foresight - the delay is because I was waiting for the last vestiges of my old life to end at the start of April (<a href="/blog/2020/04/all-change.html">when I left Substantive Research</a>). I have spent some time over the last few weeks thinking about what I want to do next, and so now is the time to set some goals for the last 8 months of the year.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Get my strength back the start-of-year peak before the end of the year</strong> This one is largely dependent on being able to get back to the gym, something that will hopefully be possible here in Australia in a month or so. At the start of the year, I set a bunch of personal bests at the gym, at the end of a 5 month plan. Since then I have gone backwards. It would be great if I can just get back to that level by the end of the year. I plan to write more about this in a separate blog post.</li>
  <li><strong>Be able to run 5km in 20min</strong> Since all the gyms shut 5 weeks ago I have taken up running again. At the moment I can do 5km in 25min, which is a good start for me. I think it is possible, but definitely a challenge, to drop 5 minutes. Historically, staying uninjured will be the hardest part of this goal.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete 3 game prototypes and maybe a full project</strong> Now that I am unemployed, I have rebranded myself as self-employed. Once again unto the indie gamedev breach. A “how is this done again?” prototype is in progress. The plan is to finish it within weeks, although I am starting slow. After that I will continue with more prototypes taking only a month or two or work each until I settle on a what seems to be a worthwhile larger project (taking 6 months to a year). There will be more said about this in the near future.</li>
  <li><strong>12 blog articles and regular social media posts</strong> While working for SR in London and during the just finished transitional phase, this blog and other social media was largely ignored. I aim to slowly reverse that, with the unambitious goal of 12 more posts here before the end of the year. I will also look to reactivate various other social media accounts, although mainly towards the purposes of promoting my gamedev work.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain other activities</strong> A lesson learnt from the last time I was working on my own projects is not to become overly focused on one project. So this goal is just to remind me to do other things. Go out occasionally, read books, play games, whatever. Learning Spanish would fit in here too, although I’m not sure if I will start again, it would be nice, but I’m not sure it would be worth the time.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The world is in a state of flux, and so is my life. As of last week, I am no longer employed at Substantive Research. Also 6 months ago I moved back in my hometown: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth">Perth, Australia</a>. The plan is to take the opportunity to try creating games again. I started prototyping ideas Monday. These new games will be smaller than Concealed Intent, but still in the strategy/tactics genre, as that is what I enjoy. I do not plan on any significant work on Concealed Intent. If there is a bug I will fix it, but otherwise that game is done.</p>

<p>I have decided to completely shelve the “A GameDev Plays…” project. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube channel</a> will continue to exist, but there are no plans to add new videos (not to say I won’t add one later if I get the motivation). The website is shutdown, and all the old content moved to this blog under the <a href="/blog/tag/A Gamedev Plays.html">A Gamedev Plays</a> tag.</p>

<p>In the next month or so, I plan to reactivate my communication channels (including this blog) and let people know what is happening properly.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>The last few years I have written annually about <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">the performance of my
Funding Circle P2P investment</a>. Last
year, despite good returns, I mentioned that I has begun to
significantly reduce that investment. Soon after I stopped reinvesting
in any new loans and starting moves to have my capital and profit
withdrawn. Thus there is little point in giving details on the returns.</p>

<p>Most of my money was returned reasonably quickly (over a couple of
weeks). Although, at this moment nearly a year since starting the
draw-down process, some 5% of my original investment is still in the FC
account. I expect another 2% will be returned soon, but have no idea
when the last 3% will get back to me. This delay is something FC
investors should consider.</p>

<p>In the current FC system there are two ways to get your money out of
loans. Firstly, you can wait for the loans to be completely paid back.
As some loans can be for 60 months, this will take a while. Secondly,
you can request that FC sell your loans to other investors. Previously
this sale could be performed on a loan-by-loan basis with seller
determined discounts or premiums to the loans
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value">NPV</a>. However, under
FC’s newish aggregate loan system, you can only specify the monetary
amount you wish to sell, and FC does the rest. This process takes a few
weeks (the shortest for me was a week, the longest 5 weeks).</p>

<p>The problem occurs because FC refuses to sell any loan that is
delinquent in its repayments. That seems fair. With the new aggregate
loan system the purchaser of the loan is not choosing the loan, so
receiving one in arrears is not a good deal. I would expect most late
loans would either get back on schedule reasonably quickly (and can thus
be sold) or become bad debt (which is essentially a loss). So I was
surprised to discover that 3% of my portfolio is in loans that are
incredibly late. One of them is over 500 days late! Another 3 are over a
year late! I would have thought a loan that hasn’t made a repayment in
more than 12 months is actually in default, but FC obviously disagree.</p>

<p>So remember, even after you want to stop, a little bit of your money
will be stuck in FC for a long time. That should be counted against any
potential profit. In my experience, the returns have still been much
better than a bank, so I don’t regret it, I’m just a little annoyed that
I am unable to close the account properly.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Here we are 5 months into the year, and I am only just writing <a href="https://www.cordinc.com/blog/2018/01/goals-2018.html">my
annual goals review/plan
post</a>. That delay
should give an indication to the importance such goals have this year.
It has been a bad start to the year, so I’m not going to set any new
objectives. Instead, ending the year in nearly the same state as it
started will be considered great success. For the remainder of this year
I just hope to continue exercising, continue some small fun projects
when possible, and work out what to do next.</p>

<p>For reference, last year my unambitious goals were to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>keep exercising - achieved, my personal bests have lept forward over
the last 18 months.</li>
  <li>keep learning Spanish - I kept up with regular lessons, but
discovered the limitations of mainly studying online. While staying
in Spain I can generally make myself understood. However, I am
completely hopeless at understanding native Spanish speakers
(demasiado rapido!). Under current circumstances, I am not certain I
will be able to continue with lessons.</li>
  <li>blog occasionally - 7 blog posts in a year, so that counts as very
occasional! I imagine this year with be similar.</li>
  <li>release Concealed Intent 1.3 - achieved, but that is the only
gamedev related task I even started.</li>

    <p>It has been a while since I went somewhere new for a holiday, so earlier
this month I spent a few days in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavik</a>, Iceland. It
was all organised on short notice, and during most of the trip the
weather was overcast (so no Aurora), but the country is well worth a
visit.</p>

<p>My best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/reykjavik_18.html">available
here</a>.</p>
