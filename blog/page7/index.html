    <p>You may of heard about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
recently? Or maybe just received a flood of privacy policy updates?</p>

<p>It is time for one more. Previously this website used some Google 3rd
party services that may track visitors (Adsense, Analytics and Search).
I have now turned them all off. It was a fairly easy decision to make. I
haver tracked the site analytics for many years, so why keep it on? Same
for the ads. In over 10 years of running this blog I have earned a few
pennies over £75. No loss to turn it all off.</p>

<p>There is still one service on this site that may use cookies and
tracking, if you are one of their customers already. That is
<a href="https://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a>, who provide the comments system at the
bottom of most pages. Their GDPR statement is <a href="https://blog.disqus.com/update-on-privacy-and-gdpr-compliance">available
here</a></p>

<p><strong>Update (2021-02-21):</strong> Commenting has been disabled, so no more potential GDPR issues there!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Behold! The <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/app/374150">1.3 update to Concealed
Intent</a> has been released!</p>

<p>This release is of course 6 months after it was original planned, but I
have just been too busy to get it done. I the end I took time off from
work to finish it. It has also been a financial failure, the 3000 sales
(so far) have not even covered my living costs during development (at
around 10K sales there would have been a profit). So, this will probably
be the last significant release for Concealed Intent. There may be a
small update to clean up a few loose ends, but basically the game is
“done” and “good enough”. It would take a great burst of inspiration
combined with a great deal of spare time for the situation to change.</p>

<p>Since Concealed Intent has been the main consumer of time for many years
now, what does finishing it mean? What comes next?</p>

<p>Now most of my time is spent at work - a normal weekday job. Supposedly
I am a Technical Product Manager at <a href="http://www.substantiveresearch.com">Substantive
Research</a> - a London startup working
in the post <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markets_in_Financial_Instruments_Directive_2004">Mifid
II</a>
research environment. However, most of my time is spent on programming
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP AI</a>
systems on research reports (not too much management). It is quite
interesting and the conditions are good, so I have no other work plans
at the moment.</p>

<p>The problem is that SR takes up most of my time in typical startup
fashion. I would like to create further games, and have more ideas than
I could ever develop, but can’t realistically get started properly right
now. I have lost that naivety. I now know how much work it required to
create a commercial game. No longer can I just start with nothing but
optimism.</p>

<p>So the plan is to continue working at SR and try where possible to
create little game libraries or other projects for fun. If perhaps they
could be later used as building blocks towards a proper game, that would
be perfect. Although, most of the time I’ll just be a boring software
programmer employee.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last year I expected to significantly reduce the <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">balance of my Funding
Circle account</a> over the following
year. Well, the year has passed and a noticeable amount has been
withdrawn, but there is still enough there to get an idea of the
returns. So, what happened over the last year?</p>

<p>Here are the returns for the last UK tax year:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.5%<br />
After Fees: 7.5%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 6.4%</p>

<p>A lower return than last year (7%), but still a decent return, although
not as good as other investments . Gross returns and fees have stayed
roughly steady compared to last year. The decrease has come from an
increase in net bad debts. It would be nice to think this is due to
Brexit issues or a change in the site’s system reducing choice (see
below), but I doubt it. I’m fairly sure the rise in bad debts is due to
a couple of the real estate loans I added last year going under in the
dropping UK property market. Based on the loan-equity ratios for those
loans I would expect recoveries to be very high, but that takes time,
and right now the loss has to be realised.</p>

<p>Since the last report, Funding Circle have changed their system again.
It is no longer possible to choose the individual loans, instead clients
are forced to go into an automatic system based on two credit rating
buckets. I have gone for the A rated loans. Will lower customer
involvement result in better returns? I’m not sure in the current
environment. Thus I will continue to slowly drain funds from the
account.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Again with the goals! Over the last year I have left Kuala Lumpur, and
spent over half a year back in London. <a href="/blog/tag/Concealed%20Intent.html">Concealed
Intent</a> has not made enough money to
live in London, so I had to get a job. Now I work in FinTech startup,
and it consumes a great deal of my time and energy. As a result there
has been little time to meet <a href="/blog/2012/16/goals-5.html">last years
goals</a> and my progress has suffered.</p>

<p><strong>Create and release a game</strong> and <strong>blog on my websites at least 4 times
a month</strong> are both failed goals. I do have 3 prototype games, but took
none of them further (yet). There was also a months work to release the
1.2 update of Concealed Intent. My blogging got close to the 48 posts
required, although still fell short. There were only 9 posts on this
blog - most in the first half of the year (before the move to London),
and not enough on the others to make up the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong> and <strong>learn Spanish</strong> went much better - I think these can
be marked as successful. I kept up around 10-15 minutes of Spanish per
day, even through the move. I have completed the beginner courses on two
websites and will start an online intermediate course soon. However,
having listened to a few intermediate level Spanish podcasts, I am not
at that level yet - I am between beginner and intermediate. In the first
half of 2017 I set personal bests in various weights exercises. In the
second half I lost a great deal of weight while maintaining strength a
little below those PBs.</p>

<p>This years my goals are much less ambitious and more vague. Keep
exercising, keep learning Spanish, blog occasionally, release a 1.3
update to Concealed Intent (the last one) and, if I have the time, do
some game dev. That is it, nothing too onerous. Under the circumstances
I can’t promise more.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I have being hearing people talking about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> recently, and as the
designated ‘techie’ some people ask me what it is (the subtext being
“should I buy some?”). I am always hesitant to say much in such
situations (no one has ever made money listening to my financial
advice!). For the interested, there are many good descriptions of the
fundamental technology online (most of my knowledge comes from this
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency">Coursera Cryptocurrency
course</a>). I also mined
some cryptocurrencies (<a href="/blog/2013/11/computer-gold-rush.html">results detailed in this blog
post</a>), but stopped very quickly
after calculating the profit vs cost. I have never owned any Bitcoin,
and have no immediate plans to change that.</p>

<p>Basically, I probably know enough to be dangerous, but falling victim to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger
effect</a>
seems appropriate for
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dunning-krugerrand">Dunning-Krugerrands</a>.
Take everything written here with that in mind.</p>

<p>Firstly, most conversations on the utility or value of Bitcoin need to
separate the cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) from the underlying technology
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a>). Blockchain
seems like a very clever solution to the problem of distributed trust
(i.e. a system where you do not need to trust anyone involved in the
system but are still able to trust the system itself), produced by
assuming that no one can control over 50% of the system. Bitcoin is the
proof-of-concept application of Blockchain, with the added benefit that
the value of the cryptocurrency encourages people to join the trust
system (by mining) and thus decreases the likelihood of anyone
controlling over 50% (also clever!).</p>

<p>As just a technology, the value of Blockchain depends on where it has
been applied. Sometimes it will be useful, and sometimes not. At the
moment it is the hot new technology and everyone seems to be using
wherever they can. As I’ve seen with previously hot technologies, I
suspect it will greatly overused in areas it is not applicable - beware!
Still I can easily imagine places it would be helpful - it would be
great for tracking ownerships of items/land in corrupt countries
(although I suspect those are the last places that would adopt such a
system for the same reason!).</p>

<p>Right now, there are five main reasons I don’t like Bitcoin. However,
each of those reasons is surmountable with time and the advancement of
technology. So while I think the Bitcoin is currently flawed and not
worth the hype, I can believe that it has future potential (or more
likely a successor cryptocurrency does). I’m sure all of these problems
are being worked upon actively (and know of a few such efforts). A
cryptocurrency that solves them all will probably be worthwhile.</p>

<p>The problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is no use for the mining calculation, it just burns
electricity (and a lot of it!). To be part of the Bitcoin system by
mining means performing a useless computation just to act as
“proof-of-work” and randomise who proposes the next block. It would
be great if this calculation had inherent value (like for instance
drug discovery). However, it is hard to find a useful calculation
that has the required mathematical properties.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and therefore no floor price.
Cryptocurrencies have no backing (other than perhaps
<a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a>). There is nothing to say the price
should not be 0 or millions. This makes it hard to act as a store of
value - holding it is currently speculation. If it was widely used
for purchases then that would be something, or if the mining
calculation had value. For comparison, commodities (like gold) have
value in the industrial uses of that commodity; national currencies
have the backing of their government, and even if you don’t trust
them, you can still pay your taxes in that currency.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin is deflationary due to a fixed total size. While the total
amount of Bitcoin in circulation is currently growing, at a certain
point in the future this will stop. The Bitcoin system has a maximum
amount of coin built into it, and when reached no more will be
added. A currency that doesn’t grow makes the economy based on that
currency hard to grow. It encourages people not to spend it as it
will likely be worth more in the future (thus deflationary).</li>
  <li>Slow transaction speed and thus high fees. Bitcoin can handle a
maximum of 7 transactions per second - worldwide! Only 7 people can
use Bitcoin in the same second! This is several orders of magnitude
less than any serious online payment system or credit card. The low
number of transactions means people have to pay fees to have miners
to include their transactions at the front of the queue. Everyone
else waits. As the demand for Bitcoin increases, so will the number
of transactions and the size of the fees.</li>
  <li>Few to no legal protections. One of the touted benefits of Bitcoin
is that is not controlled by anyone, and thus safe from government
interference or devaluation. However, this also means it is not
protected. Scams and thefts of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are
common with victims seeming to have little recourse. I don’t think
the level of corruption in the countries I reside is a serious
problem for their currencies (yet) and their central banks generally
do more good than harm - so I am happy to provisionally trust my
wealth to government currencies. I would struggle to say the same
for any cryptocurrency.</li>
</ol>
