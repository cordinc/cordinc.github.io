        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Why do I do this? Am I a masochist? Time again to assess &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/01/goals.html&quot;&gt;last years goals&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase strength and aerobic fitness&lt;/strong&gt;: As I write this, I am injured - a reoccurrence of an old foot problem. So my exercise plan is on pause. This happened a couple of times last year. The plan was to lose some weight and then push for new highs. However, due to injury, covid and other things I didn’t manage to start losing weight until November. Thus I am definitely not stronger this year. I have been cycling regularly (until my foot injury a couple of days ago) so I might be fitter aerobically. Call this one a partial success.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finish and release SHD&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2022/12/release.html&quot;&gt;Done&lt;/a&gt;! There should be a patch release soon too.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Common Library&lt;/strong&gt;: Done! Or at least done enough to qualify as a success.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Computer prototype Ci2D&lt;/strong&gt;: Nope, not even started (but the plan is to start in March).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper prototype IPO, Ci2D, &amp;amp; maybe one other&lt;/strong&gt;: Done! I have decent, not obviously broken, prototypes of IPO &amp;amp; Ci2d. Both could use a few more iterations, but not too bad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)&lt;/strong&gt;: Done! There were 12 posts here and 14 on jarrahtechnology.com.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix steps, reticulation, ceiling crack &amp;amp; shading&lt;/strong&gt;: Done!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5.5 out of 7. Not too bad actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to be as ambitious this coming year:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increase strength and aerobic fitness&lt;/strong&gt;: Once my foot heals it is time to get back on track. So I need to be aerobically fitter according to my HRM (currently 39 VO2max) and have personal bests for 5 reps (powerlifting rules) in bench press (90kg), overhead press (45kg), and pullups (102kg).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demo quality Ci2D&lt;/strong&gt;: Have something good enough to show other people (by my assessment).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continue on IPO &amp;amp; maybe one other&lt;/strong&gt;: IPO might have some potential. I should keep going with it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)&lt;/strong&gt;: Same as last year. Easy but just need to do it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fix the bedroom window issues, fix the terrace drainage problem &amp;amp; build a rabbit hutch&lt;/strong&gt;: Some things I’ve promised around the house.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paint at least 10 minatures, and have played all my boardgames&lt;/strong&gt;: I have taken up minature painting although my skill is severely lacking. I should give it a decent try. There are also 5 games currently in my boardgame collection I haven’t played - I need to change that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just after the pandemic started, I used the time in lockdown to start writing a new computer game. Later I stopped because it was a mess, but soon after I started again. Now it is released! Since it was never supposed to be a full game (just an experiment to get things going again) I have greatly skimped on promotion and marketing. Ohh, and the name. It is called Space Hex Duel. It is a turn-based game of strategy and careful positioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games/spacehexduel&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.jarrahtechnology.com/assets/posts/ahb/capsule_lg.png&quot; alt=&quot;Space Hex Duel&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a short trailer showing off the gameplay:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/62viGwySbjk&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have put it up on &lt;a href=&quot;https://jarrahtech.itch.io/spacehexduel&quot;&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; as a Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) download (suggested donation US$2). I recommend interested people download it for free, and if they enjoy it and would like to say thankyou, then go back and donate. Maybe later I will put it out on Steam too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt; &lt;iframe frameborder=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;https://itch.io/embed/1823532?linkback=true&quot; width=&quot;552&quot; height=&quot;167&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jarrahtech.itch.io/spacehexduel&quot;&gt;Space Hex Duel by JarrahTech&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the info on the game is ( or will be) on its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games/spacehexduel&quot;&gt;Jarrah Technology webpage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I need to decide what to do next…&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since the last gaming post 6 months ago, I have cut down a little on game playing, but still played a few…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/871530/Radio_Commander/&quot;&gt;Radio Commander&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (5hrs):  A tactical wargame where you only have a map and radio to command your Vietnam war soldiers. You find out what is happening via radio reports and issue orders the same way. Adds an element of confusion to what is happening - have I updated the map with the latest positions? Guaranteed that you will make a mistake at least once and called down artillery on your own men. This is a brilliant idea, but just doesn’t feel compelling. Maybe it is too slow? Maybe you are too detached from the action? Worth a try, but I stopped half way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/jurassic-world-evolution&quot;&gt;Jurassic World Evolution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (5hrs): Manage escape artist dinosaurs at an tourist park in this pretty city builder. Seems heavily tied into the recent films, which I haven’t seen. Has the nice idea of needing the player to complete missions for various departments - with any ignored departments sabotaging the park in revenge (where is HR when you need them!). Ok game, but way too fiddly for me. You are always in-motion - clicking something, or just repositioning the camera after it has flown off somewhere (again!). I prefer a slower, more thoughtful builder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/596970/Sunless_Skies_Sovereign_Edition/&quot;&gt;Sunless Skies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (12hrs): I have a love/hate relationship with this story/trading/roguelike game with some legacy mechanics (so many mechanics for such sparse gameplay!). A sequel to Sunless Skies, it sees you traversing a dangerous map in a steampunk sky world in a flying steam engine. Better than its predecessor, but still problematic as it is so slow! I played for 12 hours and the vast majority of that time was just getting between stops. I got an hour or two of story, another hour of action, but the rest was nothing happening as I travelled. I only kept going because the story and non-travel gameplay is very good - but not good enough. This game did not respect my time and I have better things to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/760650/Hammerting&quot;&gt;Hammerting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (3rs): This game feels a little undercooked. As a crafting based colony survival game (a genre I generally do not enjoy), it would need to work hard to gain my favour. Short review - it didn’t. In just a couple of hours it crashed twice and the tutorial didn’t tell me much so I could never really get going when it was working. It also suffered from the common problem with this type of game: it is incredibly fiddly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/874390/The_Battle_of_Polytopia/&quot;&gt;The Battle of Polytopia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (3hrs): Cute casual 4X game. Played 4 times in 3 hours. Not super deep, but gives a quick hit of gaming goodness. Probably played enough now, but a decent little game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/235540/Warhammer_End_Times__Vermintide/&quot;&gt;Vermintide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (3hrs): Online cooperative FPS set in the medieval grimdark Warhammer Fantasy setting where you battle hordes of Skaven (rat people). I had decent fun bashing rats over the head with my hammer. However, everything about this game is built for online play with 3 friends, and since it came out in 2015, there are now no other players. Literally the lobby was empty every time I turned it on. Nice game, but so lonely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://playruneterra.com/en-us/&quot;&gt;Legends of Runeterra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (too many hrs, Riot doesn’t tell you): Free-to-play collectable card battler from the makers of League of Legends (Riot Games) and reusing that IP. Has a nice offline single player mode, so no need to fight against real people and all the work of following a meta which that entails. While the game uses many of the modern innovations of computer-bases CCGs, the single player version suffers from some RNG problems. In an online game, if your cards just don’t roll out out, too bad (next time design the deck better). Here (in single-player) you play predesigned decks so when atrocious luck screws you and wastes 10 minutes it is not your fault, but the designers. Otherwise a good game, and the monetization seems particularly gentle, so worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;

        <updated>2022-09-02T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2022/09/hosting.html/</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This website has moved. &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2013/08/site-move.html&quot;&gt;Since 2013&lt;/a&gt; it has been hosted on a small virtual server at &lt;a href=&quot;www.linode.com&quot;&gt;Linode&lt;/a&gt;. Now it is hosted through &lt;a href=&quot;www.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;. I should mention I have been very happy with Linode’s service and cost, but their minimum service is still overkill for this simple static website. I continue to use Linode for the &lt;a href=&quot;www.concealedintent.com&quot;&gt;Concealed Intent&lt;/a&gt; game server (for now).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why the move? Maintaining an Internet facing server is a pain. There are a number of threats and it is just not worth the time in upkeep. Or worse, no support is performed and the server slowly degrades, becoming increasingly vulnerable (of which I am guilty since 2019). With Github all that work is handled by someone else, and the cost is 100% less (Github is free on my current plan, but even if I need to go to the paid plan later it’s still 25% cheaper).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some useful side effects of going to Github too. The site uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS&quot;&gt;HTTPS&lt;/a&gt; always, without me needing to play around with certs! Also, I changed DNS provider to &lt;a href=&quot;www.cloudflare.com&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;, and so far their free service is great too - they even cache &amp;amp; compress the website so it should load super quick.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I have been happy with the process and outcome. There was a bit of fiddliness getting the DNS setup due to lag in updates propogating, but that was it for problems. The only issue to solve now is how to handle automatic backups, but then Github is probably more reliable then me, so I’m not rushing (touch wood). Might have to look into moving Concealed Intent too, although that’s a much bigger task.&lt;/p&gt;

        <id>http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2022/08/roguelike.html/</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a distraction from other things I should have been doing over the last 6 weeks, I completed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/vhfsda/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/&quot;&gt;/r/roguelikedev Tutorial 2022&lt;/a&gt;. An event to teach people how to write roguelike games like &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetHack&quot;&gt;Nethack&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angband_%28video_game%29&quot;&gt;Angband&lt;/a&gt;, and my old favourite, &lt;a href=&quot;/blog/2016/07/omega.html&quot;&gt;Omega&lt;/a&gt;. I wanted to learn some &lt;a href=&quot;https://javascript.info/&quot;&gt;Javascript&lt;/a&gt;, and this seemed a good way to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is done now. There is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://jarrahtech.github.io/RoguelikeTutorial2022/&quot;&gt;playable version here&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jarrahtech/RoguelikeTutorial2022&quot;&gt;source code is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The controls are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;movement/target: arrow keys or wasd (+qezx)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;look: ‘/’&lt;/li&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I’m just back from a week in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane&quot;&gt;Brisbane&lt;/a&gt; (or more like 5 days when travel days are taken into account). It is worth visiting, but I don’t feel any need to return (is this how people feel about Perth?). It seems like a city for living. We spent most of time walking around the city and just hanging out. Surprisingly pleasant thing to do as long as one doesn’t travel too far into the suburbs. The city makes decent (but not great) use of its river. There are good crowds in the CBD, good public transport - it all felt safe. A nice trip.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also spent a day on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast,_Queensland&quot;&gt;Gold Coast&lt;/a&gt; and my thoughts of that city are less favourable. It felt sterile and empty, like a retirement village. However, many of the shops and bars suggest a beach &amp;amp; alcohol centred holiday resort (like parts of Spain, not my sort of thing). So maybe it was quiet because it was a working winter’s day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not enough good photos to create a slideshow of this trip. I rarely felt the need to take a photo.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61401626&quot;&gt;iPod is no more&lt;/a&gt;, long live the iPod. My first iPod was a second generation model bought in early 2003. Since then I have always had one, my third and last was a leaving gift from teammates at Merrill Lynch in December 2007 (such a great gift). Despite currently poor battery life, it is still running (in near daily use) as the music/podcast system for my car (see pic below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/last_ipod.png&quot; alt=&quot;My last iPod&quot; title=&quot;My last iPod&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I loved all of my iPods, even the short-lived second one that had battery issues from purchase and was quickly replaced by the improved 2007 model. I like to walk around aimlessly, so have always carried a means of listening to music on-the-go. However, the iPod with its small size and large capacity proved to be a step-change in quality compared to old &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman&quot;&gt;Walkmans&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discman&quot;&gt;Discmans&lt;/a&gt; or just a radio. They gave me the time to listen to great music and my first taste of a world of interesting podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is sad that they have fallen foul of mobile phones’ hunger for new functionality. RIP my old friend, at least until a nostalgic return in a decade or two.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Esperance (and places along the way)</title>
        <link type="text/html" rel="alternate" href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2022/04/esperance.html/"/>
        <published>2022-04-16T00:00:00+08:00</published>
        <updated>2022-04-16T00:00:00+08:00</updated>
        <id>http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2022/04/esperance.html/</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Late last month (scheduled to avoid school holidays) I went on a week’s holiday. Three nights in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperance,_Western_Australia&quot;&gt;Esperance&lt;/a&gt;, and 3 nights on the journey there and back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I expected to be unimpressed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Rock&quot;&gt;Wave Rock&lt;/a&gt;. While the rock itself is largely as expected and will be largely “done” in a matter of minutes, the surrounding area has a few other interesting sights and walks. Well worth spending a day checking the place out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The size of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatbelt_(Western_Australia)&quot;&gt;wheatbelt&lt;/a&gt; is astounding. We could drive for hours (often speeding) for 2 days only seeing continuous wheat fields broken occasionally by huge “bins” (horizontal wheat silos) and even more rarely by a tiny town.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Esperance is larger, greener and further than expected (again). It is a decent sized town with enough local industry to maintain itself - it is not just a tourist town (but there is a decent amount of that). I have this idea that the desert starts not far from Perth, and nearly no one lives out there. Clearly this is not true, although it took long days of driving to get to Esperance, and we passed very little on the way other than dry’ish farmland.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tourist Esperance is mainly about spending time outside. There are so many beautiful beaches we became numb to them by the end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It was incredibly and constantly windy for our entire time in Esperance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_Western_Australia&quot;&gt;Albany&lt;/a&gt; harbour was in Europe or China I’m sure it would be the base of a famous or historical town. It definitely looks like it should be full of tall ships or triremes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Restaurant food continues to be disappointing outside Perth and a couple of tourist towns. We had one good (and one decent) restaurant meal on the entire trip - the rest were poor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IPhones take decent photos! All the photos here were taken on phones despite having my old trusty point &amp;amp; click camera. It is hard to justify taking the extra device when the phone does so well. I suspect just discovering this means I am years behind the times.&lt;/li&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Starting as a teenager and continuing into my 20’s I had occasionally recurring dream of going up the Swan River from Perth (where I grew up). Within a few twists and turns it would quickly transform from urban city into wild bush with high river banks. Then I would arrive at a wonderful water funpark in the middle of this wilderness. I never thought much of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I moved back to Perth. Now I live in Maylands, just a few kilometres from the city centre. Part of this area is a pennisula into a curve of the Swan River. Soon after moving in I went for a walk down to the river and immediately had a sense of deja vu. The area around the river is a park giving way to a swamp before the water, and on the other side are high banks with trees and modern apartment blocks poking up over the top.  It reminded me of more realistic version of that dream (if the apartment blocks were gone).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/posts/dreamscape1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Maylands Pennisula&quot; title=&quot;Maylands Pennisula&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then I saw the water park. It is clearly for small children - just some shallow pools and small slides. No photos as it is currently under reconstruction and mostly just looks like a building site. Presumably that dream must have been based on a real (and probably happy?) visit to this place when I was a very young. Forgotten consciously, it lived on in slumbering fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>AI Hot Take</title>
        <link type="text/html" rel="alternate" href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2022/04/ai-hot-take.html/"/>

        <id>http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2022/04/ai-hot-take.html/</id>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Some recent news on AI advances had me thinking about the implications and reminiscing on my own work in that area. Google’s new large language model named &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html&quot;&gt;Pathways&lt;/a&gt; is the current trigger. Its results are impressive. I find its ability to reason about language almost incredible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My views are definitely hot-takes as I am no longer an AI professional. Even when I was, I worked a long way from the pointy end that gets written up in research papers. Reader beware, the following could be bollocks. Still I’m not quite as shrill as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wrkEnGrTTrM2mnmGa/retracted-it-s-time-for-ea-leadership-to-pull-the-short&quot;&gt;this hot-take&lt;/a&gt; but probably not as thoughtful as &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/russelljkaplan/status/1513128005828165634&quot;&gt;these tweets&lt;/a&gt; either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, I did my undergrad thesis on neural nets in the mid-90s (just as they were going out of fashion again) and then worked on logic programming for postgrad research (as symbolic techniques were popular at the time). Most of my professional career has not been AI related - until 2018 when I worked for a company using older machine learning techniques to analyse financial market research (I left in 2020). However, I have kept an interested eye on the field the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So my thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improvement in AI models remain much worse than non-linear. It is a particulary bugbear of mine when people suggest making an AI twice as “smart” would only be twice as hard (a common argument amoung non-technical singularity advocates). Nope, twice as good is more like 1000x as hard or worse. When doing logic research I counted myself lucky if the algorithms were merely of exponential complexity. Current researchers are throwing exponentially (at least) more hardware and resources at these problems to get incremental changes. Only the largest and incredibly well financed organisations can hope to compete.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connectionist systems FTW. The history of AI has seen many swings between connectionist and symbolic techniques. However, with the improvement in neural networks since the advent of deep learning in the 2000’s, Team Connectionist is ascendant and for so long with no change in sight. The computational logic parts of CS departments must be in heavy decline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No whiff of consciousneess. When I swapped from neural nets into logic systems it was because I was unimpressed by them as just complex statistical inference. I still hold that opinion, but the results can’t be ignored. Now Pathways can do basic logical inference out of its connections. The conflation of intelligence and consiousness is under attack. It will be interesting to see where the final line is drawn as the importance of consciousness decreases.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Language as root of functional intelligence? All these great results are coming out of language models. Is that because there is a fundamental link between communication and intelligence? Or is it simply because that is where researchers focus their attention? I don’t know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
