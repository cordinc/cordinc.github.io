    <p>Java provides a number of methods to run code at scheduled future time,
the implementations of
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ScheduledExecutorService.html">ScheduledExecutorService</a>
generally being the best way at the moment. ScheduledExecutorService
also defines methods to run the code a periodic intervals
(scheduleAtFixedRate &amp; scheduleWithFixedDelay). However, what if you
have classes that need to be notified at regular discrete intervals and
need to know which interval they are in. A timer is required that with a
set periodicity fires an event on any listeners and passes the number of
times the period has elapsed. What this is doing is breaking up
continuous “realtime” into discrete blocks or quantums of time. For
example, if the period is 10 seconds, at the start the time quantum is 0
until 10 seconds have elapsed and an event is fired denoting the start
of the first time quantum. Ten seconds later another event fires as the
2nd time quantum starts, and so on.</p>

<p>This is a fairly simple bit of Java code. Any experienced Java developer
has probably already worked out a good solution, but for me it has come
up a couple of times in the last few months so I thought I’d write it
down.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>It was recently suggested to me that there could be risk-free money to
be made crossing <a href="http://www.betfair.com">Betfair</a> and
<a href="http://www.betdaq.com">Betdaq</a>. Betfair and Betdaq are betting
exchanges - they allow their users to bet on various events, from the
traditional horse races to more unusual fare like netball or the UK
general election. Unlike a normal bookmaker, the exchanges don’t provide
the odds and take the opposing side of the bet. Instead the odds are
determined by other users and the other side is another user. So while
there may be someone offering 1.15 odds that Labour will win (a <a href="http://help.betfair.com/contents/itemId/i65767719/index.en.html">back
bet</a>)
the next UK election, someone else may offer 1.2 that they will lose (a
<a href="http://help.betfair.com/contents/itemId/i65767719/index.en.html">lay
bet</a>).
When the back and lay odds match then a bet is made. Note, all the odds
quoted in this article are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-odds_betting#Decimal_odds">decimal
odds</a> as
this is the type of odds used on the exchanges.</p>

I could not find a course website.</p>

<p>This is a series of 8 anthropology lectures on the topic Socities in
Transition recorded at <a href="http://www.linacre.ox.ac.uk/Linacre">Linacre College, Oxford
University</a> during early 2009. Each
podcast is just under an hour and audio only (occasional mention is made
of slides). Each lecture is given by a different presenter. All are
fairly academic in nature (a couple are quite dry and I found it hard to
maintain concentration), but are still accessible to the non-expert.
These lectures are not straight history, there is little discussion of
historical events. Instead each podcast presents current research on the
process of social transition during a notable period of history. They
often provide an interesting snapshot (or at least intriguing tidbits)
of life around the time of the transition.</p>

<p>The lectures are in chronological order, spanning the entirity of human
history - and beyond. The first lecture is on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal">Neanderthals</a> - their slow
extinction and modern discovery. The next lecture deals with the spread
of farming in South East Asia. Then follows an interesting lecture on
the spread of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy">metallurgy</a> in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age">Bronze Age</a> and what the
metals meant to society at different times and places. Another
interesting lecture details attempts to date and size the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption">volcanic
explosion at Thera</a> (now
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini">Santorini</a>). From this research
the presenter trys to match up the likely effects with events and
history in the region (mainly the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization">Minoan</a> society on
Crete). The next two lectures are respectively on the beginning and end
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain">Roman rule in Britain</a>.
Apparently the collapse of the British economy after the Romans left was
particularly swift - previously common pottery and coins disappeared
almost overnight and buildings quickly fell into disrepair. The last two
lectures are on more modern topics - the industrial and the current
information revolutions.</p>

<p>Worth a listen for background information on the timeperiods discussed.</p>

    <p>This is a quick post about a coding problem that took longer than
expected to solve. I have put an example solution here as a reference
for myself or others, hopefully speeding up the task. I needed to create
a dialog to connect to a local or remote
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/">JMX</a>
process. Essentially this would be very similar to the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/jconsole.html">JConsole</a>
“New Connection” dialog. Initially I thought this would just be a
standard component, but instead it took some trial and error (as well as
digging through Sun documentation) to get the required functionality
working.</p>
