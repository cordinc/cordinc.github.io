    <p>Greece is collapsing. So says the media. The news regularly shows riots
in Athens; the papers discuss the dire economic straits. A person here
in London could easily form the view the precipice is near.</p>

<p>Having spent a week in Athens last month, I didn’t leave with the
impression disaster was imminent. People generally seemed to be going
about their daily business. There were no clear signs of distress (apart
from one incongruity). Indeed, other cities I have visited appeared to
be in worse situations. While a large amount of my time was spent in
busy tourist throngs around the archealogical sites, I also travelled
out into the surrounding areas. What I saw appeared to be a working
city. There were numerous storefronts with decent traffic and many
business offices. The streets became busier after work hours. Bars and
resturants were quiet during the day, but became busy late in the night.
At one point we saw a crowd blocking a street near Syntagma, it could
have been a well behaved protest, or just as easily people waiting for
some celebrity. There was a lot of graffiti, but also a lot of graffiti
art. Not so different to London really and there was probably about the
same number of unused/abandoned buildings. Although unlike London, many
of the occupied buildings appeared quite run-down and not well
maintained.</p>

<p>There was one indication of possible problems. On a quiet side street
North-East of Omonoia we walked past trees, parked cars, buildings that
looked like apartment blocks, and little shops. Then there were two
burnt out cars next to each other. They were completely wrecked - the
fire destroyed everything. However, there was no damage apart from the
cars. Either the fire was somewhere else and then the wrecks dumped
there or the immediately surrounding area was cleaned up (but the cars
left). Both seem strange. Apart from these wrecks, Athens did not feel
different to most cities I have visited.</p>

<p>Cities are ususally places of vibrant activity - normally business
related. Visit London, Paris, Sydney, Barcelona or Milan and you feel
you are in a working city. There is the sense that the locals are busy
getting things done. Travelling around London, I am constantly amazed by
the number and variety of business nameplates outside buildings. You can
walk for hours from Shoreditch across to Hammersmith and it is busy
offices the entire way. Washington and Rome feel more dominated by
tourism and government, but there is still lots happening around you.
Two places I feel didn’t match this description, at the time I visited,
are Lisbon and Tunis. There was a general lack of activity in Lisbon, it
seemed almost empty. Never have I seen so many empty, decrepit
buildings. Tunis was similar, full of people, but they didn’t seem to be
doing much. There was always a large number of men sitting in cafes,
presumably un- or underemployed. These two cities felt like they were in
dire economic straits. Indeed, Portugal is currently mentioned in
similar financial terms to Greece, but that situation was clearer on the
streets of Lisbon than Athens.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>This week saw a visit to <a href="http://www.harwoodarms.com/index.htm">The Harwood
Arms</a> - a gastro pub in Fulham,
recently awarded a Michelin star. It is round a few corners from Fulham
Road, on a quiet suburban street. From the outside the place looks like
a pub, but inside it is set up like a restaurant. Apart from the bar and
a small sofa area, the entire floorspace is occupied with tables. So I
can’t imagine your meal would ever be interrupted by casual drinkers,
although there is a quiz night every Tuesday.</p>

<p>The menu focusses on British produce with a special emphasis on game,
most of which is apparently hunted or caught by the owners. For a
starter I had a wild mushroom soup with mussel fritters. There was a
surprisingly large amount, although it was so nice it certainly was not
a problem to get through it all. The main dish was shoulder of deer for
two with celeriac mash, vegetables and a little salad. It all came on a
large platter so that you could carve the shoulder yourself. However,
this wasn’t at all arduous as the meat was so beautifully tender it just
fell off the bone. Again, a large amount of delightful food. After that
I was too full for dessert, but I’m assured the sticky toffee and date
ice cream with lemon curd was delicious.</p>

<p>The Harwood Arms had a pleasant atmosphere, not quite a pub but still
welcoming. Service was prompt and courteous. The cost was reasonable for
a top restaurant (by London standards!), dinner for two (starters, main
and one dessert) with wine was under £100. Excellent food and well worth
a visit.</p>

and <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulearn/arts-and-humanities/podcast-a219-greek-theatre">OU
Podcasts</a></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> series examines theatre
during the time of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece">Classical
Greece</a>. In particular it
details the production of the world’s oldest surviving play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persians">The
Persians by Aeschylus</a>, first
performed in Athens at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Dionysus">Theatre of
Dionysus</a> in 472BC.
Like the other OU podcasts, this series is a set of short documentaries
to accompany lectures. There are 4 video podcasts totalling around 40
minutes in length, with the individual videos ranging from 7 to 14
minutes. They are available in iPod or a larger (640x360) format. There
are also transcripts. The visuals are mainly talking heads interspersed
with shots of theatre ruins, vases or in later episodes modern
productions of The Persians.</p>

<p>The first video details what the Theatre of Dionysus would have looked
like in the 5th century BC and what it would have meant culturally to
attend the theatre at that time. Performances would have been important
events, it is estimated that the theatre could probably hold around a
third of the male citizens of Athens (it is not certain women were
allowed to attend). The second video covers the actors and chorus in
Ancient Greek theatre. Ancient Greek plays only had 2 or 3 actors, who
would each play multiple parts while wearing masks. The next video
examines how some Greek plays have managed to survive 2500 years - only
7 of Aeschylus’ estimated 90 plays still exist. The last episode
discusses some modern interpretations of The Persians.</p>

<p>A good short podcast series, but probably only for people particularly
interested in Ancient Greek theatre.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>In another of my recent series of generic utility Java classes, I
present a multi-channel asynchronous throttler. My project connected to
an external webservice which imposed draconian restrictions if usage
went above a certain level - defined as whether there were more than <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>
service calls in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code> seconds. I was determined to stay under this level.
Furthermore, some types of service calls were more expensive than others
and had their own limits in addition to the overall limit. That is for
certain types of service call I had stay under two limits - a call
specific limit and the overall limit that applied to all calls. I refer
to this as multi-channel throttling. Also, I wanted the throttler to be
asynchronous, that is I did not want to stop procesing while waiting for
the webservice to respond to my call. Looking on the web I found a
number of throttlers, but none that matched my multi-channel,
asynchronous requirements.</p>
