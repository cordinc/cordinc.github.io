    <p>Once the mech model is rigged as in the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/3_rigging/">previous
tutorial</a>, the
bones can be used to help animate the mech. Here we will create a simple
walk cycle for the rigged mech. This is the last tutorial in this series
on using Blender to create a mech model. The final result of this
tutorial, and thus the entire series, is shown in the video below.</p>

    <p>Some time ago I wrote a post describing a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/04/java-multichannel-asynchronous.html">Java Multi-channel
Asynchronous
Throttler</a>
I had written. At the time, I stated it would preserve the order of
calls, but as Asa commented on that blog post, this was not always the
case. Here is a new version that does preserve order, and passes Asa’s
test. As part of this work I also extracted common code into new classes
and created a ChannelThrottler interface. It works by placing incoming
tasks on an internal queue. All the code detailed in this post (and the
other throttler post) <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/projects/throttler.zip">is available
here</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>Update: This podcast no longer appears to be available online.</strong></p>

<p>Available at <a href="http://www.oid.ucla.edu/webcasts/courses/2009-2010/2009fall/hist9a-1">the course
website</a>.</p>

<p>Finding podcasts on ancient history which do not focus on Mediterranean
civilisations is very hard. The only one I have found so far is
<a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA’s</a> History 9A - History of India course.
This is a recording of the lectures given as part of the university
course by <a href="http://www.history.ucla.edu/people/faculty?lid=51">Vinay Lal</a>
at the end of 2009. However, the course encompasses far more than the
ancient history for which I was searching. Starting with the first
civilisations, it races through history to end with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement">Indian
Independence</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India">Partition</a>.</p>

<p>This course is not available on iTunes but there is a course website
with the lectures in both MP3 audio-only and video in real player
format. Unfortunately, two of the lectures were not recorded. The 27
recorded lectures are around 50 minutes in length and 24MB (for the
MP3s, I didn’t watch the videos). As is normal with recorded lectures
there is some class discussion taking up the first few minutes of each
podcast. The course reading is also available from the <a href="http://classes.sscnet.ucla.edu/course/view/09F-HIST9A-1?topic=-1">class
website</a>.
Professor Lal occasionally mentions visual aids, but video is available.
Production quality is otherwise fine and the material is presented in an
interesting manner.</p>

<p>The podcasts start with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">Indus Valley
Civilisation</a>
(in what is modern Pakistan), one of the three early human civilisations
along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_egypt">Egypt</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>). These people
were replaced by the Aryans (no relation to the Nazi Aryans) in some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_invasion_theory">disputed manner</a>.
From there the course quickly skips to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism">Hindu</a> religion and culture,
telling Indian history through Hindu texts. I imagine a similar history
of Europe could be told through early Christian texts, but it would miss
much. In Europe, there were many non-religious texts; the lectures
suggest that in comparison, Hindu texts are the main primary sources for
ancient Indian history.</p>

<p>In any case the lectures on Hinduism are quite interesting if you don’t
already know much about the religion. The course covers the content of
the main <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_scriptures">Hindu texts</a>
from the Vedas, Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Puranas and a little
on the Bhakti poets. It is intriguing to see how some Hindu concepts
such as Karma or Yoga have been transformed in western culture. Yoga is
a much larger concept then physical exercise and describes many methods
of achieving the goals of life. The Hindu gods also have many avatars -
incarnations or personifications of aspects of the god. One of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar#Avatars_of_Vishnu">avatars of the main god
Vishnu</a> is Buddha - this avatar appeared at a time when Buddhism was expanding in India.
The lectures also detail the basic beliefs of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism">Sikhism</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> (including a
discussion on its disappearance from India) - all of which have their
origins in India.</p>

<p>After the arrival of Islam towards the end of the first millennium AD,
the course returns to a more traditional history format. As there is
still a thousand years to the present day, the coverage of events can be
succinct. Starting with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate">Delhi
Sultanate</a>, Muslim rule of
India continued with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire">Mughal Empire</a>, which succumbed to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company</a>.
It seems strange to have a country ruled by a foreign company and
Professor Lal spends some time detailing how this occurred. The
subsequent rule (and sometimes, misrule) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj">British
Empire</a> is covered, with the
final lecture detailing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi">Gandhi</a> and
his policy of nonviolent civil disobedience leading to independence.</p>

<p>Not knowing much about Indian history other than the basics, I can’t say
I learnt a huge amount more through this podcast, although there are
occasional worthwhile tidbits. However, I did learn a huge amount about
Hinduism. It covers all Indian history in an introductory sweep.</p>

    <p><strong>Possible Spoilers Below</strong></p>

<p>Last night I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurt_Locker">Hurt
Locker</a> for the first
time. I was looking forward to it. I had heard so many reviews and it
had won 6 Oscars. However, to put it politely, I didn’t like it. I
consider it well below average. Both the major and minor characters are
unbelievable and fit neatly into standard movie stereotypes (“he’s a
maverick, doing dangerous things - but he gets results!”). The scenarios
in which the characters find themselves seem unlikely. One character
carjacks a local and travels across Baghdad, then runs back to the base.
At another point, 3 characters search for enemy bombers in the
backstreets by themselves and unknown to their support. Coming to a
three-way junction, they split up! The script is often heavy-handed,
letting the audience know exactly what they are supposed to be thinking.
For instance, when confronted with a possibly involuntary suicide
bomber, the interpreter repeatedly reminds us “he’s a good guy”. Once is
required, maybe twice to stress the point. However, the many repetitions
beyond that are just clunky. At once crucial point we are told “he has 4
children”. Are we perhaps supposed to empathise with him?</p>

<p>The plot is quite episodic. This got me thinking. It might be that the
story’s ambition was neutered by making it a movie in the first place.
The story has potential and maybe many of its problems (heavy
handedness, stock characters) could be solved by taking longer to tell
it - much longer. It is very hard to fit a complete interesting story
with detailed real characters into the 2 hour timeframe of a film. I
doubt even extending the running length to 3 hours, the extreme end of
theatrical releases, would give enough room to properly tell Hurt
Locker’s story. Perhaps it should be a TV series.</p>

<p>I remember a time not long ago when the 4 or 6 hours of a mini-series
were the longest storylines around. Now there have been quite a few TV
series with continuous storylines. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Babylon 5</a> was the first I remember, but
since then there have been the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire">The
Wire</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos">The
Sopranos</a> among many others.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Kill">Generation Kill</a> told a
similar story to Hurt Locker more successfully over 7 hours. After
watching these, other TV shows with their “everything resolved in 40
minutes” episodes seem inferior (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Dr
Who</a> is suffering from this at
the moment). I am not suggesting film is inferior in general, just that
it has its limits and most of the best films don’t try to do too much.
For great characters and great stories the extra time afforded by TV
pays great dividends.</p>
