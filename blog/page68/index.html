or the <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978539">UC Berkeley
website</a></p>

<p>In between Professor Isabelle Pafford recording <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/12/history-4a-the-ancient-mediter.html">The Ancient
Mediterranean
World</a>
and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/01/history-110-roman-republic.html">History 110: Roman
Republic</a>,
she recorded a lecture series from <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>
in the Spring of 2008 on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman
Empire</a>. The series consists
of 48 audio-only lectures, with most between 30 and 45 minutes in length
(and around 10MB in size). The podcasts sometimes reference slides which
are unavailable online.</p>

<p>The podcasts detail the Roman Empire from its origins in the civil wars
of the 1st century BC to the fall of the Western Roman Empire nearly 500
years later. There is a long introduction on the events leading up to
the republic’s fall and the creation of an empire. The first half dozen
lectures are essentially a recap of the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman
Republic</a> podcasts,
starting with the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla">Sulla</a>
and running through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Julius
Caesar</a> to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Octavian</a>. Pafford points out
that the empire only looks like destiny in retrospect, and at the time
people were very unsure of the future. By comparison the end of the
empire passes very quickly. The last hundred years of decline in the
west after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_the_Apostate">Julian the
Apostate</a> through the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome">sack of Rome in 410AD</a> to
the last emperor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus">Romulus
Augustulus</a> are covered
in a single lecture. Little mention is made of the east’s transformation
into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine
Empire</a>. Along the way we
learn about the convoluted family history of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty">Julio-Claudian
dynasty</a>, the
stabilising influence of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine_dynasty">5 good
emperors</a>,
the near collapse of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century">3rd century
crisis</a>, and
the conversion to Christianity under
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I">Constantine</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot of history covered during the nearly 27 hours of this
series, so I will not go through all the content. The lectures are
largely in chronological order and detail history from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source">primary
sources</a> of the time. Thus
they focus mainly on the emperors and palace history and there are many
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_emperors">Roman emperors</a>
(especially during the 3rd century crisis). There is also an interesting
and constant discussion on the reliability of primary sources. How bad
were emperors like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligua</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius">Tiberius</a> really? The sources
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius">Suetonius</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus">Tacitus</a>) describe some
incredible events, but at the same time the sources were known to be
hostile to them. Presumably the sources couldn’t believably say too many
bad things about the more popular emperors like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus/">Augustus</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius">Claudius</a>, but could safely
exaggerate with the less well liked. As Proffessor Pafford says, the
truth behind Tiberius’ time on Capri with crowds of young children may
not be as lascivious as the sources imply, but she certainly wouldn’t
send her kids to spend summer with Uncle Tiberius!</p>

<p>Interspersed within the chronological series of podcasts are the
occasional side lecture. These include: the Roman city;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome">slavery</a>; the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Ancient_Rome">role of women in Roman
society</a>; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman
religion</a>. There
is also a lecture on Roman art which unfortunately involves cases
studies on artifacts shown to the original class, but unseen by the
audio-only podcast listener. Despite this, these side lectures are among
the best of the podcasts as they give an insight into general life in
the Roman Empire and a break from the constant palace intrigue in the
main lectures.</p>

<p>As with previous podcasts, the production quality of this series is not
the best. However, for most lectures it is at an adequate level. The
podcasts are recordings of actual university lectures, so there is some
class discussion at the start of most lectures. One lecture starts with
10 minutes of talking about an assignment, including the class cajoling
Professor Pafford to give them an extension on their assignment (which
they got). There are no missing lectures. Apparently one wasn’t recorded
so Professor Pafford rerecorded it (thank you!). The first few lectures
are recorded at a low level and are hard to hear, but after that they
get much better apart from a buzz in a couple of them.</p>

<p>Professor Pafford is an entertaining lecturer and the course is full of
interesting detail. Most of the lectures have acceptable production
values. One of the better podcast series available.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generics_in_Java">Java 5 added generics</a>
into the language. This allowed programmers to specify class types as
parameters to other classes and maintain type safety. For instance
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set&lt;Integer&gt;</code> is a set of integers and if you try to add a
non-integer to it, a compile time error should occur.</p>

<p>Java had been around a while by the time generics were added.
Unfortunately it was considered too hard to add generics to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_bytecode">Java
bytecode</a> that forms a
running Java program. Instead generics are just syntactic sugar. When a
Java program is compiled the generics are checked, but after that they
are stripped out. The bytecode that is run does not know anything about
generics. This means it is possible to violate the generics constraints
in the code at run-time (because the constraints don’t exist at
run-time).</p>

<p>Below is an example demonstrating the problem. A set of integers is
created, but then using reflection a string is added to the set. This is
clearly a violation of the set’s definition. However,
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/Reflection/">reflection</a>
is a run-time process and the compiler is not smart enough to detect the
potential error at compile-time (which would be very hard to do). If the
set is now inspected (and not checked carefully), it will look like the
integer 1 is in the set, rather than the actual string “1”. At this
point various errors can occur, from the subtle <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">contains</code> error below,
to outright
<a href="http://download-llnw.oracle.com/javase/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/ClassCastException.html's">ClassCastException</a>
if elements are extracted from the set as integers. As an aside,
reflection is very cool and a great tool, but from my experience, most
of the time it is the wrong tool.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nc">Set</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="n">integerSet</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">HashSet</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nc">Integer</span><span class="o">&gt;();</span>
<span class="nc">Method</span> <span class="n">addMethod</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">integerSet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getClass</span><span class="o">().</span><span class="na">getMethod</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"add"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="nc">Object</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">class</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">addMethod</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">invoke</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">integerSet</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"1"</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="n">integerSet</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">contains</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">);</span> <span class="c1">// -&gt; false</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Remember, Java generics are not real generics. In particular pay special
attention to using reflection on generic objects.</p>

Astute readers may remember I said the aim was to create a model that
could be used in a simple game. Now that the model is complete, it is
time to use it in a simple 3D program. The aim is to write a program
where the mech is controlled by the player and can walk around the
screen using its walkcycle animation. Writing everything from scratch is
not realistic in any reasonable time frame. Thus the
<a href="http://www.ogre3d.org">Ogre3D</a> library is used to help with the
graphics. I chose Ogre3D because it is free, seems well regarded, is
actively developed and, has exporters for Blender models. Below is an

<p>The <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> has a huge number of short
podcasts available and many are related to ancient history. Roman
Funerary Monuments is part of their course on the classical world. The
title accurately describes the content. There are 7 video podcasts in
this series with a combined running time of roughly half an hour. All
the videos are available in either iPod or a larger (640x360) format,
with PDF transcripts. The visuals entirely consist of Roman funerary
monuments in their modern state with documentary style narration. The
necropolis at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isola_Sacra_Necropolis">Isola
Sacra</a> features
heavily.</p>

<p>Rather than focus on the monuments themselves, these podcasts use them
to provide an insight into Roman culture. As the most common form of
remnant surviving from Roman times, funerary monuments are a useful
primary source. Epitaphs provide names (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions">Roman
names</a> were very
informative), ages, family relations and sometimes a short biography.
Thus the dead could create a lasting image of themselves, emphasising
the positive aspects of their life (in a Roman context) and omitting the
negative. Freed slaves tended to take particular advantage of this, with
their tombs being more extravagant than others of similar wealth.
Funeral monuments also suggest that family relationships were important
(especially among freed slaves, perhaps because as such relationships
would have been limited under servitude). Roman law prohibited funeral
monuments inside cities, so they were built alongside the roads leading
out of the towns. Spots directly alongside the road being the prime
location. Tombs also sought to catch the eye, and were designed to be
visited. They often contained items to promote a longer stay such as
art, furnishings, and in one case, a well.</p>

<p>This series is well worth a viewing.</p>

  <h4><a href="/blog/2010/08/rules-of-programming.html">Rules of Programming</a></h4> 
  Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/General.html">General</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Coder, programmer, software developer, IT engineer. Whatever it is
called, my profession has changed the way I think. I started learning to
program 23 years ago as a hobby, started studying it seriously 17 years
ago and have been doing it as a job for 13 years. Now I seem to think a
great deal straighter than I did before - straighter than when I was in
my early twenties and studying postgrad logic. By thinking straight, I
mean following a chain of logical rules to their conclusion -
determining what they imply and where any gaps in the rules or strange
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case">corner cases</a> exist.
Straighter in that I can quickly work out the logical chain, identify
problems, and ignore unimportant avenues of thought. I don’t tend to
take the scenic route anymore; I go straight to the destination.</p>

<p>This makes sense to me, most of my job as a programmer is thinking
straight. Writing the code is very easy once the language is mastered.
Instead, the job comes down to solving problems with code. At the start
of a project this is done by precisely specifying the steps of the
solution in code. No ambiguity is allowed and all the possible
situations must be covered. Edge and corner cases will cause bugs, so
must be considered. As the project progresses, any changes or additions
must take into account interactions with the body of rules already
encoded in the existing codebase. As the complexity of the system
increases, so do the possible interactions and it gets harder to run
through them. This is one of the reasons big systems tend to have so
many problems and why experienced coders try to keep things as simple as
they can.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable that I have trained myself this way. I have far more
than the suggested
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)"></a>10,000
hours&lt;/a&gt; of practice. A back of the envelope calculation suggests I’m
close to 50,000 hours. That much practice is bound to etch a groove in
my thought process. Sometimes that groove is too easy to follow and I
get lost in thought, monomaniacally thinking about a system. In software
development this state is often sought out and is no bad thing, except
in your interactions with other people. Sometimes I wonder if a similar
process is at work in other professions, perhaps with less than ethical
results.</p>

<p>I studied a Business degree mid career (so far). It hasn’t been of huge
career advantage to me, as I have learnt I am happiest just coding away.
However, I did learn the basics of some other professions. There was a
semester of accounting and another of contract law. In both courses the
lecturers spent some time detailing how case law or accounting rules
were applied - explaining that it wasn’t intuitive and you just had to
follow the general rules. What!? I found it quite simple to apply the
rules and I achieved good marks with little effort. I just did the same
thing I did every day, simply swapping lines of code for case law.</p>

<p>My impression is that both law and accounting use similar thought
processes to programming - applying rules to reach a desired end state.
While programming uses exact statements of software logic; law and
accounting use the written language in laws, cases or standards. This
natural language is more malleable and open to interpretation. I
sometimes wonder if people in other professions get similarly lost in
their rules. Focussing on just beating the problem as presented to the
exclusion of other concerns. This could offer a generous excuse for the
motivation behind results like tax evasion, or dodgy financial products.</p>
