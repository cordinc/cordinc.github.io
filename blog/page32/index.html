    <p>Current episodes available via paid subscription at
<a href="http://velocast.cc/subscribe">Velocast</a>, much older episodes available
at <a href="http://velocastcc.squarespace.com/twich">this website</a>.</p>

<p>For a change from ancient history, I have started listening to a podcast
on cycling history. Produced by the people at
<a href="http://velocast.cc">Velocast.cc</a>, it is also notable as the first
podcast or MOOC I have reviewed that actually costs money. For £8/month
a subscriber gains access to weekly news and history podcasts and daily
new podcasts during major races (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_de_France">Tour de
France</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giro_d%27Italia">Giro
d’Italia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vuelta_a_Espana">Vuelta a
Espana</a> and the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_cycle_races">Classics</a>). I
received a years subscription as a gift and consider it good value (so
will probably resubscribe at the end of the year). All the podcasts are
very entertaining, including TWiCH (as they refer to it). Production
quality is high.</p>

<p>Each episode is roughly 45 minutes to an hour long and endeavours to
reference events that happened during the same week in previous years.
So in May most episodes refer to events that occurred during the Giro,
during March it is the classics, and so on. This plan breaks down a bit
with races that move around the calendar (like the Vuelta) and during
the winter off-season. The episodes contain 3 segments. Each segment
starts with a few minutes of pre-recorded introductory context on a
particular event or aspect of bicycle racing. Then there is 10-20
minutes of lively discussion between the two presenters. Often they
deviate wildly from the topic at hand, but it is always entertaining
(and usually informative). Recent stories include: the hotly-contested
Tour de France <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanterne_rouge">Lanterne
Rouge</a> (last place)
“competition” in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerhard_Schonbacher">1979</a>; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Roche">Stephen
Roche</a> winning the Giro in
1987 against his own teammate; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Anquetil">Jacques
Anquetil</a> winning his
only monument,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liege-Bastogne-Liege">Liege-Bastogne-Liege</a>
in 1966. In general the stories are interesting and not the traditional
famous ones heard repeatedly. The subsequent discussions are lively and
entertaining. The two presenters have an immense knowledge of cycling
history between them. Although they do often seem to mention cycling
clothing fashion, pedalling style and Irish cyclists (one of the
presenters is always <a href="https://twitter.com/irishpeloton">Cillian Kelly</a>
who is Irish, so familiarity is probably the reason).</p>

<p>For fans of cycling who want to know more about the colourful history of
the sport.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.eveonline.com/">Eve Online</a> is a game I have consciously
avoided over the years. Not because I thought I wouldn’t enjoy it, but
because I might enjoy it too much, and thus see too much otherwise
productive time slip away (<a href="https://minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> is
another game I avoid for similar reasons). However, recently the game
had a <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> sale so I thought
I’d give it a try. After all, I’m writing a vaguely similar game (albeit
single-player) and have pretensions towards writing more games along a
similar theme. It would be remiss not to experience, and try to learn
from, one of the giants of the genre - a very successful game over a
sustained period of time. Or at least that was my justification.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Young kids today - embarrassing themselves all over the Internet with
their ill-advised photos! They will never be able to obtain high public
office! Of course, I think the only difference between the current and
previous generations is in the wide availability of evidence of their
indiscretions after the fact. There exists (or at least used to exist 20
years ago) a photo of me, which I think is understandable, but with a
bit of spin in the media would stop me becoming Prime Minister. Let me
explain.</p>

<p>During my 4th year at university I lived in a student house (I was 20).
There were four of us in a large house on Vincent Street opposite Hyde
Park in Mount Lawley. Besides me, there was a just-graduated accountant,
a med student who seemed to spend most of his time partying, an artist
and normally a random person or two crashing on our sofa. The artist was
an interesting guy - a Thai orphan raised in Australia. Much of his art
focused on satirising the military. We had a series of paintings around
the house of Godzilla sized cartoonish characters in military uniforms
(usually from World War 2) rampaging through cities or battlefields.
Right outside my bedroom door was a giant Goofy-like character throwing
tanks around. He also had an original 9 foot Nazi Swastika flag in his
bedroom (the house had very high ceilings).</p>

<p>I have met a few overt racists in my time, and this artist was
definitely not one of them. If he was harbouring any fascist tendencies
they were very well hidden. He claimed to be interested in the art of
Nazi Germany and so collected artefacts from that time. Kind of like
admiring the films of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leni_Riefenstahl">Leni
Riefenstahl</a> while
ignoring their propagandistic purpose. He had a few other items as well,
but tended to buy them, hold onto them for a few months (taking photos
and drawing them) and then sell them to fund new items. While we were in
the same house he sold a SS dagger to buy an original
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> uniform jacket. This
is where I join the story.</p>

<p>He normally took photos with a blue-eyed blond-haired friend modelling
the items he bought. The artist never appeared in the photos himself as
he said he didn’t fit, being a dark-skinned South-east Asian. However,
the Luftwaffe jacket would not fit his friend - it was very small. At
the time I did a lot of long distance cycling and was quite small
myself. At just over 5’9” and just under 59kg, I was borderline
underweight according to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index">Body mass
Index</a>. Also I have
blue-eyes and, at the time, had sun-blonde hair. So the artist asked me
to put it on and I thought “why not?”</p>

<p>That jacket was small. The length was about right for me, maybe it was
for someone an inch or two shorter. Still, I could barely do up one
button. I was forbidden from trying a second in case I ripped it. It was
uncomfortably tight across the shoulders and chest. Whoever wore this
originally was very small - either they were a young teenager or
undernourished (or both!). The artist said it dated from 1944, towards
the end of the war. I guess by that stage Germany was desperate for
manpower and pressed anyone they could into service. It was also made of
poor material. It felt like a Hessian sack, very rough to touch. Again,
this is apparently not unusual for uniforms from that time (as times
were tough). Lastly, the jacked had a small rip just below my last left
rib. Was it a bullet hole, or just an accident from sometime during the
50 years since its manufacture? We didn’t know and there was no mention
of it in the accompanying documentation.</p>

<p>Then two photos were taken and my career in public office finished
before it began. Or probably not. Those photos are 20 years old now. I
look quite different (no hair and much heavier for a start!). I never
saw the result. I don’t even know if they were actually developed (this
being before digital cameras) or if they still exist. However, I learnt
more about the conditions at the end of the war in those few minutes
wearing that jacket than in my high school education (or various
jingoistic war movies). I feel great pity for the poor boy who wore that
same jacket half a century before me. I can’t say I regret it.</p>

    <p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/norman-centuries-norman-history/id333142230">iTunes</a>
and on its blog, <a href="http://www.normancenturies.com//">Norman Centuries</a></p>

<p>Following on from his <a href="/blog/2013/07/12-byzantine-rulers.html">12 Byzantine
Rulers</a> podcast, <a href="http://larsbrownworth.com/">Lars
Bronworth</a> narrated this history of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normans">Normans</a>. I hesitated to write
this review, since as the final episode (a recap and historical context)
is yet not published. However, the second last episode was published
over a year ago, so unfortunately I’m not sure the series will be
finished. Currently 19 well produced audio-only podcasts exist (each
around 20 minutes in length). The series is largely a historical
chronology of events, ranging from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollo">Rollo</a> the Viking to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor">Frederick
II</a> the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor">Holy Roman Emperor</a>.
Lars has also toned down his grandiosity in these podcasts, so my
complaint about that in his previous series is not relevant here.</p>

<p>From a modern perspective, the Normans appear as chancers and warlords
carving out dominions in failed states; eventually acquiring
respectability along with their lands. Rollo was a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings">Viking</a> leader who repeatedly
raided northern France. Eventually the French King offered Rollo the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchy_of_Normandy">Duchy of Normandy</a>, so
he was baptised as Robert and became the protector of the lands he
previously ravaged. The Vikings that settled in Normandy becames known
as the Normans. The tales of subsequent Dukes of Normandy are detailed
until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_the_Conqueror">William the
Conqueror</a> who
became King of England after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hastings">Battle of
Hastings</a>. William is
the last of his line detailed in this series. Strangely, no mention is
made of the Normans who ruled over England for the hundred years after
William.</p>

<p>The Normans didn’t stop at Normandy and England. The sons of a minor
Norman noble, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tancred_of_Hauteville">Tancred de
Hauteville</a>, sought
their fortune in Italy. They succeeded in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_conquest_of_southern_Italy">conquering most of Southern
Italy and
Sicily</a>.
Most of this series is devoted to the Italian Normans and their
machinations with, and against, various Popes, Byzantium Emperors, Holy
Roman Emperors, and other local rulers. Lars mentions that the elite
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varangian_Guard">Varangian Guard</a> soldiers
in the Byzantine army included many Anglo-Saxon refugees from Norman
England - interesting to see how people moved around Europe over a
thousand years ago. The Normans formed the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Kingdom_of_Sicily">Kingdom of
Sicily</a> which
stood around a century until absorbed into the Holy Roman Empire after
Frederick II, who was both the King of Sicily and Holy Roman Empire,
being descended from the Norman Kings and German Emperors. The series
ends with a couple of podcasts on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohemond_I_of_Antioch">Bohemund</a>, a
grandson of Tancred de Hauteville without lands in Italy, who became
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Antioch">Prince of
Antioch</a> after
capturing the city in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusade">First
Crusade</a>.</p>

<p>An interesting podcast about a period of history when small groups could
have a large impact.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The last online course completed in my recent burst of MOOC study was
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ancientnubia">Ancient Nubia</a> by <a href="http://www.emory.edu/">Emory
University</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. Ancient history courses are
dominated by Mediterranean cultures (at least the ones presented in the
English language). <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/tag/History.html">Ancient Greece and
Rome</a> are well represented
in online courses and podcasts. Thus opportunities to study other
ancient civilisations must be seized on the rare occasions they arise.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nubia">Nubia</a> is the region immediately
south of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cataracts_of_the_Nile">Nile’s first
cataract</a>, and
stretching down past the sixth cataract. In modern geography this is the
area between Egypt south of Aswan, and Sudan north of Khartoum.
Civilisation arose here soon after ancient Egypt, and there was
extensive interaction between the two. Trade had definitely commenced by
the time of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Kingdom">Old Kingdom</a>
(as there are texts describing the commerce); Pharaoh’s during the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt">Middle Kingdom</a>
conquered various parts of Nubia; and, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Kingdom_of_Egypt">New
Kingdom</a>, Nubian
kings returned the favour conquering Egypt in 760BC and forming the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-fifth_dynasty_of_Egypt">25<sup>th</sup>
Dynasty</a> - a
period known as the reign of the Black Pharaohs. Nubia was also
influenced by (and influenced) societies in central Africa and in it’s
later years by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Aksum">Axum</a>.</p>

<p>Archaeologically, Nubia has received a great deal less attention than
it’s famous northern neighbour. However, when Egypt decided to build the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aswan_Dam">Aswan Dam</a> it became clear that
many Nubian ruins would disappear under the resulting lake. Numerous
studies were undertaken before the flooding, and since the Nubians
sometimes built in stone and had a written language, a great deal can be
determined about them.</p>

<p>This 8 week course is presented by Dr Peter Lacovara and covers the
history of Nubia from prehistorical beginnings until its decline around
the 3<sup>rd</sup> century AD. The course progresses chronologically and
is largely focussed on major events and archaeological artefacts. Each
week consists of around 30 minutes of video and a multiple choice test.
There is no exam. There is however a class participation requirement.
Posting in the forums every week on a set question is worth 5% of the
overall course mark. This forced participation may work well in small
classes, but in an online class of several hundred it just resulted in a
great deal of what essentially became little more than “me too” posts.
The first few had interesting information, but they soon decayed into a
waste of space. I avoided this part of the course.</p>

<p>The video lectures are mostly the presenter sitting down and talking to
the camera. Occasionally there are interviews, slides or short
documentary extracts. The lecturer seemed uncomfortable talking to the
camera, but was fine in interviews. Production quality is consistently
high.</p>

<p>A worthwhile, but basic, course on Nubia.</p>
