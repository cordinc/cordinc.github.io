    <p>Apologies for the fake conflict in the title. There is no actual fight.
It is only that there is regularly talk of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada
Lovelace</a> as a female role
model for computer science, but very little mention of the more
influential <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/Lovelace_Hopper.png" alt="Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper" title="Ada Lovelace and Grace Hopper" /></p>

<p>With very few women studying Computer Science and becoming programmers
(or other computer specific professions), there is some discussion as to
what can be done to remedy the situation. Part of this has been the
promotion of female computing role models, and Ada Lovelace has been
prominent suggestion. Ada was born during the early 19<sup>th</sup>
century into the British aristocracy - both actual (her father was a
baron and she became a countess) and cultural (her father was the poet
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gordon_Byron">Byron</a>). Studying
mathematics at a time when higher education was largely closed to women,
she encountered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage">Charles
Babbage</a> and his designs
for a mechanical general purpose computer - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine">Analytical
Engine</a>.</p>

<p>The Analytical Engine was never built (unlike Babbage’s calculator-like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine">Difference Engine</a>).
Still Ada Lovelace studied the designs and wrote some programs to run on
it (calculating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number">Bernoulli
numbers</a>). She also wrote
notes displaying some foresight on how such machines could be used as
more than mere calculators (like modern computers). For this Ada
Lovelace is sometimes referred to as the first computer programmer.
Although I think she is closer to the first computer scientist (as her
code never ran - a trait in common with many lecturers I have known!).
Ada cuts a romantic, tragic figure - never having the chance to see her
work realised and dying at the age of 36. She has also been adopted by
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steampunk">Steampunk</a> crowd. Ada
Lovelace has cultural cachet.</p>

<p>I am not trying to diminish her achievements - they are notable given
the time period. However, I do not think they are influential or
important to modern computing as more than a point historical interest.
I have the same opinion of the Analytical Engine itself - both were a
technological dead-end.</p>

<p>Grace Hopper was born at the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century into a
middle-class family in New York. By the 30’s she had become a
mathematics Professor at Vassar College. During the war, Grace became
part of the US Navy’s code breaking team - the less lauded US version of
the UK’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bletchley_Park">Bletchly Park</a>.
After the war she stayed in the Navy and joined the team working on
building the early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIVAC_I">UNIVAC</a>
computer. Then Grace wrote the first
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler">compiler</a>. The compiler is an
important part of the computer engineer’s toolbox - converting more
understandable programming languages into the assembly/binary understood
by the computer. This is work for which I am personally grateful, as I
like to keep as far from the bare computer metal as possible when
programming. She also created the first machine independent language.
This became <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">COBOL</a> after some
design by committee changes (Grace Hopper was part of that committee,
but let’s not hold that against her). Nearly 55 years since it was first
developed there is still COBOL running in production environments (I
have seen it at some banks). Considering her work on the early COBOL
compilers, it is possible that some of Grace Hopper’s code is still
being used half a century after being written. That is impressive
considering most of <a href="/blog/2012/04/lost-code.html">my code barely lasts a few
years</a>. She retired from the Navy as a
Rear Admiral and had a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Hopper_(DDG-70)">ship named
after her</a> (perhaps not as cool as a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_(programming_language)">programming
language</a>).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/first_bug.jpg" alt="The first computer bug" title="The first computer bug" /></p>

<p>Grace was clearly a person of great technical ability. Unfortunately she
is most remembered for an anecdote. While tracing an error in a program,
Grace discovered a moth had become stuck inside the computer resulting
in the error causing fault. Thus was coined the term “bug” for errors in
computer code and “debugging” for fixing these errors. I think this
popular story masks her influence. It is hard to remember a woman who
has had more impact on the practical side of the professional computer
engineer. Grace Hopper would make an admirable role model for any coder,
regardless of gender.</p>

    <p>This final part of my high-school
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign’s
history starts with the player characters rich, powerful and famous.
While at this point the party only had four members, each was around
level 10-11 and loaded down with magic items. Together, there were few
creatures in the world they couldn’t crush. Challenging the players was
becoming difficult and ridiculous (witness the hordes of hell that
finished <a href="/blog/2014/01/dd-campaign-history-part-3.html">part 3 of this
history</a>). As a group we
took a break for a year and fought the Kafer War in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2300_AD">2300AD</a> instead. Then returned,
refreshed, and reacquainted ourselves with the characters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Raven - a huge brutish warrior with spiky armour to match his
demeanour</li>

    <p>Recently we made a quick trip over to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, Indonesia for a
long weekend. The main purpose of the trip was a visit to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur">Borobudur</a>, the largest
Buddhist temple in the world. We also ate a number of Indonesian style
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krupuk">prawn crackers</a> and went for a
tour of a couple local villages.</p>

<p>Before travelling to Borobudur we were warned to expect many local
children asking to have their taken photo with us. This was supposedly
because while the temple is a major tourist site, it is mostly visited
by Indonesian tourists, many of who may not have seen Europeans before
in person. I’m not so sure that is true. We got half way through the
site (up to the top) before a flurry of photo requests (to which we
happily agreed). All the requests came from groups of high-school age
children in halting English, and normally with a few standard followup
questions - what is your name, where are you from, do you like
Indonesia? I heard a couple of the kids repeating my answers to
themselves and another taking notes. It think the requests might be part
of school assignments where the children were taking advantage of a
steady supply of foreigners to practice their English. Anyway, if you
visit be prepared and tolerant.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I have dropped out of my first
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a>, the
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ggp">General Game Playing</a> course from
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. Having completed half the 8 week
course with a score of 100%, it would be easy to continue. However, the
course is not interesting enough to justify the effort required.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing">General Game Playing
(GGP)</a> involves
creating computer programs that can compete in multiple, previously
unseen games. These games can be single-player or multi-player; have
perfect or imperfect information; and may be competitive or cooperative.
The resulting players must be able to handle all games without any
internal changes, so are closer to the ideal of generalised
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_artificial_intelligence">AI</a>
than the very narrowly focused computations used in traditional players
like the Chess-only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep
Blue</a>. The
games are specified in a logic-based language. A Java library is
available to implement the basics of the client/server game playing
protocol and parsing game messages (including the game specification).</p>

<p>Each week the course covers some aspect of writing the players with
30-60 minutes of video - mostly the content of these involve running
through a couple of chapters from the lecturer’s textbook. Every week
there are multiple assignments - some as online tests, while others
require programming. By the end of the course each student will have
created a player they enter into a competition against the other
students’ work. The resulting ranking feeding into the overall grade,
although the details were not available by the time I quit.</p>

<p>To me the course seemed to be mainly teaching their “system” (that is,
the game specification and protocol). A few useful ideas are presented,
for instance Propnets and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo
simulation</a>. Although,
I had already covered most of these techniques previously. It was like
doing a work course on MS Office or some other proprietary technology.
The course is not worth the time, unless practice in formal logic and
related optimisation techniques is needed.</p>

<p>So I unenrolled and it has disappeared from my course history. This
seems to be a common event. Another recent online course advertised that
it dropped 80% of its students over the first two weeks - apparently a
good result! I haven’t given up on online courses. Right now I’m halfway
through 2 other, more compelling courses (another reason to free up time
by quitting this one), with another starting in a fortnight. Being able
to easily unenroll is a benefit of MOOCs. This way there is no barrier
to give giving one a try. If it doesn’t work out, just stop. Of course
now I’ve quit one, it will probably easy to quit again!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Some months ago I posted about <a href="/blog/2013/11/computer-gold-rush.html">mining
cryptocurrencies</a>, concluding
that it probably wasn’t worth it. Since then
<a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has boomed and then bust, with
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26446142">theft</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox">bankruptices</a> and possible
regulation galore. Despite the volatility and bad press, Bitcoin has
doubled in value since the original post (although at one point it was
up over 500%). Other, minor, cryptocurrencies have oscillated in value
roughly in line with Bitcoin.</p>

<p>In the original post I estimated that if my desktop PC mined
<a href="http://feathercoin.com/">Feathercoin</a> for 100 days the result would be
224 FTC worth US$15.68 (7 cents per FTC). I left the mining program
running after the “experiment” ended as it didn’t seem to noticably slow
the computer. So now 150 days later the result is 180 FTC currently
worth around US$21 (11.5 cents per FTC). The lower mining rate is due to
not being a particularly conscientious miner and the ever increasing
difficulty of the calculations required to mine successfully.</p>

<p>So what can be done with $20 worth of Feathercoin? Initially it seemed,
very little. There is a <a href="https://feathercoinmarket.com/">Feathercoin
Market</a> of seemingly random items - none
of which interested me. Next I hoped to convert the coins to US$. I
found <a href="https://crypto-trade.com/">Crypto-Trade</a>, an exchange based in
Hong Kong that allowed FTC/USD trades and didn’t charge excessive fees.
Unfortunately, it also doesn’t have any useful cash withdrawal options.
While it is easy and cheap to withdraw various cryptocurrencies, cash
can not transferred to a bank account or even Paypal. It has to be taken
in the form of various east european e-payment systems. Not even the
online poker sites I use would accept them. I looked into methods of
conversion and found various sites charging 5-10% to exchange them for
Paypal, but every single one has pages full of “this is a scam!”
warnings on Google. I then considered converting the Feathercoins for
Bitcoins (or Litecoin) and then using other larger exchanges to get US$
transferred to Paypal. However, the fees for this route would turn my
$20 into less than the minimum transfer amount of $10! Next I looked
into converting the coins to Bitcoin and purchasing Amazon vouchers with
them. Many sites exist to facilitate such transfers. Unfortunately, only
US$ vouchers are available and Amazon has strict policies against non-US
people (like me) using them. Urgh.</p>

<p>At this point the situation was dire, much time had been spent on a
futile investigation of Feathercoin’s utility. The whole system seems a
little “wild west”, with high percentage fees, scams and frauds common.
It is definitely much easier to get money into Bitcoin than the
opposite. I certainly doubt the value of the system as a currency.
Although it has prompted an explosion of witty aphorisms. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dunning-krugerrand">Dunning
Krugerrand</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Pocius/status/435568115791826945">this
tweet</a> are my
favourites.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to write the whole thing off as a folly, I found
<a href="http://www.cryptodechange.com/">Crypto-de-Change</a>, as site that
converts cryptocurrencies for UK Amazon vouchers. I exchanged 161 FTC
for a £10 voucher (about 10.5 cents per FTC). At least there is some
result, but now I am more skeptical than ever. I used the voucher to buy
a book by Charlie Stross - <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html">it seemed
appropriate</a>.</p>
