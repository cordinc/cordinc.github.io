    <p><strong>Deux because they’re fancy!</strong></p>

<p>Starting with the best, <a href="http://www.pied-a-terre.co.uk/">Pied a Terre</a>
is a small, intimate restaurant in Fitzrovia. At least I think it is
small. It appears to be a converted house, so there are many small
rooms. We were in the front room with four tables, most of which were
empty during our meal, and none were in our eyeline. The large front
window was frosted to just above head height. The room felt light, but
no one on the street could see in, nor could we be distracted. Combined
with the staff materialising as if from nowhere whenever required, the
impression was a private dining experience. It is the effect
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/05/fancy-restaurants.html">Hakkasan</a>
was attempting and failing to achieve (there I felt as if I was on a
stage with down lighting trying to isolate our table in a large room).
We ordered the tasting menu with the discovery wines option. Were I to
describe each dish it would become a bore of hyperbole. It is safe to
say the food was incredible, sometime surprisingly so. I’m not normally
a fan of raw tuna, but here the flavour was exquisite. The wine was of a
high standard with two outstanding exceptions and another disappointing
exception (which turned out to be from my home town). Although with 8
glasses over 10 courses it was too much and we had to leave nearly half.
The staff were friendly but to the point and never instrusive. Overall,
the meal was verging on perfection. The main negative point was the
expense - oh my lord the expense. It is by far the most expensive meal
I’ve ever had by a long way. About 50% more expensive than Hakkasan,
which I thought was expensive. For the cost of this meal for two, you
could feed eleven at The Sportsman. Having said that, I’m glad to have
been once, just not sure I could justify another visit before I win the
Lotto jackpot. If this is what two Michelin stars is like, how much
better can three be?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.babur.info/website/index.php">Babur</a> is an Indian
restuaurant in Forest Hill (about 15 minutes walk from where I live)
which recently won an award. I thought it was the “Best Cheap Eat in
South London”, but I’m told that’s not right, and if it is correct then
it must only just qualify on the price criteria (to my mind it’s at the
high end of cheap - £60 for two, with beer but no wine or dessert).
Their takeaway menu is very good so we went for a sitdown meal. The food
was excellent. I had the ostrich starter with tandoori jumbo prawns (the
largest prawns I have seen in Britain), it was mouthwatering and
satisfying in the way good curry can be. Based on the food alone, this
would be one of my favourites. However, I found the service a little
lacking. Our naan was forgotten, but when pointed out it was removed
from the bill with no hassle. Also they tried to sell us a loyalty card
a little too strongly. At first I was interested, but after a quick
calculation realised it wouldn’t be much use to us. We politely refused.
So far no problem. However, they then proceeded to try selling it to us
a further two times, each time explaining to us the “benefits” in full
as if we hadn’t grasped the system the first time. I wasn’t impressed.
Overall, despite the hassle it’s worth a visit.</p>

    <p>I wanted a project to allow attachments to be added to tasks. My
requirements were that: users should be able to add multiple attachments
to a task up to some maximum limit; there should be validation on the
size of the attachments (combined with the number limit this should
ensure I don’t run out of disk space too fast); and, that there should
be some security on downloading a task’s attachments.
<a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip/">Paperclip</a> seems to be
the popular Rails attachment at the moment and is still under active
development, so I hoped to use that. However, it does not handle
multiple attachments for a model. There is a plugin
<a href="http://github.com/heavysixer/paperclippolymorph/tree/master">PaperclipPolymorph</a>
which adds multiple attachments to Paperclip, but I just couldn’t get it
to meet my validation and security requirements. In the end I wrote my
own solution and this article details it.</p>

    <p>I recently had a problem with a service for which I paid a monthly fee.
My faith in the providing firm’s ability to provide the service was
destroyed. I cancelled the service and thought about adding the firm to
my list. “What list?” I hear you ask. The list of companies of which I
have been a paying customer, but will never be a customer again. In the
end I decided not to add them, they were helpful is sorting things out
and cancelling the service. Plus, they have other services I would still
consider.</p>

<p>In any case I thought it would be good to display my list. I won’t add
links or describe the circumstances of them being added. I don’t want to
provide free advertising, nor fall foul of British libel laws.</p>

<p><strong>Companies of which I have been a paying customer, but will never be a

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Five hardy souls braved the hail to attend the 4th Poker evening held
last Saturday in the salubrious surroundings of a Fitzrovia public
house. Ann, Pete, Christian, Amanda and I met for the now standard 2
Hold’em tournaments. Congratulations Amanda for being the big winner on
the day, with Christian just edging out myself in the winnings list.</p>

<p>The first game started slow with few big hands, small bets and a great
deal of bluffing (at least from myself). At one point my bad dealing
allowed some people to see that one of Pete’s pre-flop cards was a jack.
He decided to keep it and displayed it for all to see. When the flop was
jack-high, everyone folded except Ann. When another jack came on the
turn, the bets got bigger and the quips began “Ann, do you think he’s
bluffing”? In the end Ann’s J10 was better than Pete’s J6. As soon as
the half hour mark was reached and the blinds increased the game became
much looser. Amanda was out first, then Ann tried to catch my bluff with
KQs against my heavy betting, but I wasn’t bluffing with QQ. Soon Pete
was out and it was Christian and I, man-to-man. However, Christian’s
luck ran out shoving against my A10 with his pocket pair. It was all
over in under an hour.</p>

<p>The second match began with a furious pace. Early on Pete and I were
quite aggressive and on a couple of occasions got caught in bluffs (I
did and it looked like Pete did too). Myself, Amanda and Pete went out
in the first 30 minutes and rebought. I was out again soon after, going
all-in on the flop with a mid-pair and flush draw. Ann was again sure I
was bluffing, and considering my roughly 35% change of getting the flush
she wasn’t too far off. Later Pete pushed preflop and most of the table
folded. As two 4’s came on the flush Ann was visibly disappointed - she
had folded the other two 4’s. The commiserations didn’t last long as in
the next hand Pete’s AKs was beaten by Amanda who had four 5’s! With
Pete and myself out it looked like the game may settle down as the next
few hands were quite passively played. However, Amanda soon took up the
mantle of aggression with relish, building a stack that would win any
game of <a href="http://www.handdrawngames.com/">desktop defense</a>. With
consistent betting she gave no clues to her hands. At one point Amanda
with 27o (the worst possible hand) matched big pre-flop bets against Ann
with JJ. When the flop and turn came with two 7’s and not much else,
Amanda bet big and Ann again tried to catch a bluff. Thus, a very small
stack Christian played Amanda heads-up. Amanda continued to push every
hand (“poker is easy when you have such a big stack”) and Christian was
soon left as the big blind with only a small blind stack. With Christian
all-in just to make the blinds, the hole cards were dealt face-up - his
AA won the smallest possible pot! Christian’s luck came too late and the
game was over on the next hand - Amanda was the winner.</p>
