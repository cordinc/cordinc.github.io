  <div class="content">
    <p>Yesterday was the 3rd Poker evening. It was held at Ian’s place and
seven people turned up: Me, Ann, Ian, Christian, Cristina, Pete and Ury.
We played three games and as has become usual, started by reducing
expectations on our ability. I didn’t take notes so my memories are a
little limited.</p>

<p>The first game was a standard £5 NLHE tournament, and I started in my
standard heads-up manner - aggressively. As people started betting small
amounts, I bluffed the first hand and then bet big on the turn in the
second with a flush draw, straight draw with two overcards. Then I
realised I was betting pot percentages, while others were making bets of
big blind. The game settled down a bit, but with the occasional big move
reminiscent of the first few hands. Pete went out first and rebought.
The numbers were steadily whittled down. Just after an hour Pete had a
run of great cards (at least the ones we saw) and knocked out the last
few people in quick succession. I was second.</p>

<p>For the second game we played with substantially smaller stacks to
accommodate Pete and Ury who had go in an hour. This seemed to make
everyone aggressive and as the blinds doubled when someone was knocked
out we were all quickly down to around 10 big blinds each. It seemed
like nearly every other hand someone was all-in. There was rarely an
obvious bluff - people just had good cards, often in fact the same good
cards (on at least 2 occasions the pot was split equally). I went all-in
against Ann on the first hand when there was a spade flush on the board - whoever had the higher spade would win. Knowing that Ann is quite a
cautious player, I thought I could scare her off the pot despite not
having a single spade. Ann knows I bluff so after an age of thinking,
called with her 9 of spades and I had to rebuy. The carnage continued
and Ian was out the next hand. Pete’s run of good cards continued at the
start, knocking out Cristina with KK vs QQ preflop. At the end Pete’s
luck ended and mine started with three great hands in a row to beat Pete
into second. The whole game lasted under 45 minutes - very quick.</p>

<p>Only Ian and I were available for the third game, everyone else had to
leave. Considering it was a heads up match, I don’t remember much other
than I finished my beers right at the start. I do recall that after
playing for a while I won a big all-in pot and thought I had crippled
Ian. Instead after matching chips we were equal with perhaps Ian
slightly ahead! Ian was grinding me down. I tried to tighten up, but it
didn’t work and I got annoyed at a couple of hands I definitely played
too weakly postflop. In the end I misread Ian’s body language thinking
he had nothing when infact he was trying to disguise having the nuts.
Ian won.</p>

    <p>I recently travelled to Tunisia for a holiday. Visiting the ancient
ruined Roman city of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dougga">Dougga</a> was a
highlight. It is quite hard to reach as an independent traveller. First
you have to find the Tunis Northern Bus Station (out of the tourist
areas), go on a 2-hour bus journey to Teboursouk (the closest town),
from there you arrange a return taxi trip to the ruins. Once there
though, it is quite impressive. We had the place almost to ourselves for
a couple of hours - perhaps we should have arranged for a longer stay
with the taxi driver, but we had to catch the last bus back to Tunis!
Some of the best photos I took are <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157611388103847/">here on
Flickr</a>.
In future I will put more photos up under that Flickr account.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Now that I have a couple of sites up and running on the web, I thought
I’d talk about how I chose my hosting providers and how it’s going. For
those who just want the short version: I use
<a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a> and am very happy with them. Read
on for more details.</p>

<p>When looking at potential hosts for my Rails web apps I took into
consideration price, speed/memory, reliability and flexibility. I
basically wanted something cheap, reliable and fast. I’ve been an
amateur sysadmin before (and at my first dotcom job was technically a
pro sysadmin), so I wasn’t scared of getting into the unix command line.
Thus support wasn’t important. Similarly for a small project, bandwidth,
email accounts and credit-card billing systems would not be used. I
wanted more than a hobbyist’s hosting site (even if that is exactly what
I am), but not costly, professional hosting.</p>

<p>My first thoughts were my domain name register,
<a href="http://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, or the host of this blog,
<a href="http://www.pair.com/">pair</a>. I know a number of people have issues with
GoDaddy, but I’ve always found them fine for buying domain names and I
can just ignore their constant upselling. However, I wasn’t sure about
their Rails hosting and a search only found bad stories (eg.
<a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/godaddy_hosting_now_supports_rails.php">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.ericdaugherty.com/blog/2007/07/rails-on-godaddy.html">here</a>
and
<a href="http://blog.mcmoyer.com/2007/9/14/running-rails-on-godaddy-a-k-a-how-do-you-keep-a-geek-entertained">here</a>).
I’ve also been happy with the service Pair have provided with this blog
and associated static website. I didn’t find much online about their
Rails hosting and decided it would in any case be best to use different
providers for this blog and my Rails apps.</p>

<p>Next I took a look at some webpages specifically listing Rails web
hosts, such as on the <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/RailsWebHosts">Rails
wiki</a>. Among the
massive listing there, special mention is made of
<a href="http://joyent.com/">Joyent</a> and
<a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">EngineYard</a> on a couple of occasions.
Certainly, these two companies seem to be held in very high esteem in
the Rails community and host many well known Rails sites. However, they
are both quite expensive - aiming for the high-end market. Too expensive
for my goals or really anyone without funding. They are more
aspirational - it would be nice to one day need the services of such a
hosting firm.</p>

<p>I also found a couple of lists at
<a href="http://www.rubyonrailswebhost.com/">rubyonrailswebhost</a> and <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com/2006/01/01/rails-hosting/">Zen and
the Art of
Programming</a>. They
rate <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/">Dreamhost</a> and
<a href="http://www.site5.com/">Site5</a> highly and both hosts matched my needs:
dirt cheap (under $10/month) and with decent reliability according to
reviews. Before signing up I sent Antonio Cangiano at <a href="http://antoniocangiano.com">Zen and the Art
of Programming</a> (a decent Rails blog I now
subscribe to) an email asking if he had any updated advice since his
blog on hosting was nearly 2 years old. Antonio suggested a new name,
<a href="http://www.slicehost.com/">Slicehost</a>. Slicehost use a virtualisation
system so that it appears to the hosted application that it has a whole
server to itself (albeit a fairly small server). This means that someone
else’s app can’t hog resources slowing down your app. With memory
intensive Rails apps this is very useful. They also have full command
line access - you basically start with a clean build and can
install/configure it how you like. While any “point and click” users
would find it daunting, this really appealed to me. They provide a
number of <a href="http://articles.slicehost.com/">useful getting started
articles</a>, including some Rails ones, so
I was sold. They are more expensive than other hosts at $20/month for a
256MB, but I have been very happy with their service over the last 6
months.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I have been asked what time I get the forecasts for a location in my
<a href="http://www.cordinc.info/weather/">historical weather forecast system</a>.
The obvious problem being that if I read all the forecasts at nearly the
same time, different cities could be in different days due to differing
timezones.</p>

<p>The answer is, I read the forecasts at roughly midday in each of the
locations. That is, every hour I read the forecasts for the locations
where it is roughly midday. This is done by approximating the various
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_zone">timezones</a> using the location’s
longitude. This isn’t exact - it doesn’t account for daylight savings or
places like China, which is all one timezone despite being wide enough
to be split into many. Generally it is accurate to within a couple of
hours - fine for the purpose. The code is below.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">time_band</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="no">Time</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">now</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">gmtime</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">hour</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">12</span>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> The weather_report project and the weather archive is no
more. The effort required to maintain it was too great, for more
information <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/11/the-weather-archive-is-not-mor.html">see
here</a>.</p>

<p>I often have ideas for little projects, most never go anywhere, but some
act as distractions and bother me until I complete them. Recently, I
wanted to know what the weather was in London a few days in the past.
Easy, I thought, I just find it online. I couldn’t. There are many sites
with the current weather or forecasts. However, I could not find any
with historical weather. So I quickly created one based on my knowledge
of <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/11/using-bbc-backstage-weather.html">BBC
Backstage</a>.</p>

<p>I have put the system up <a href="http://www.cordinc.info/weather">here</a>. It is
still at an early state, it may change or be shutdown. At the moment it
displays only last month’s historical weather forecasts.</p>
