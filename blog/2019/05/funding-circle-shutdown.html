<h4>Funding Circle Shutdown</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>The last few years I have written annually about <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">the performance of my
Funding Circle P2P investment</a>. Last
year, despite good returns, I mentioned that I has begun to
significantly reduce that investment. Soon after I stopped reinvesting
in any new loans and starting moves to have my capital and profit
withdrawn. Thus there is little point in giving details on the returns.</p>

<p>Most of my money was returned reasonably quickly (over a couple of
weeks). Although, at this moment nearly a year since starting the
draw-down process, some 5% of my original investment is still in the FC
account. I expect another 2% will be returned soon, but have no idea
when the last 3% will get back to me. This delay is something FC
investors should consider.</p>

<p>In the current FC system there are two ways to get your money out of
loans. Firstly, you can wait for the loans to be completely paid back.
As some loans can be for 60 months, this will take a while. Secondly,
you can request that FC sell your loans to other investors. Previously
this sale could be performed on a loan-by-loan basis with seller
determined discounts or premiums to the loans
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_present_value">NPV</a>. However, under
FC’s newish aggregate loan system, you can only specify the monetary
amount you wish to sell, and FC does the rest. This process takes a few
weeks (the shortest for me was a week, the longest 5 weeks).</p>

<p>The problem occurs because FC refuses to sell any loan that is
delinquent in its repayments. That seems fair. With the new aggregate
loan system the purchaser of the loan is not choosing the loan, so
receiving one in arrears is not a good deal. I would expect most late
loans would either get back on schedule reasonably quickly (and can thus
be sold) or become bad debt (which is essentially a loss). So I was
surprised to discover that 3% of my portfolio is in loans that are
incredibly late. One of them is over 500 days late! Another 3 are over a
year late! I would have thought a loan that hasn’t made a repayment in
more than 12 months is actually in default, but FC obviously disagree.</p>

<p>So remember, even after you want to stop, a little bit of your money
will be stuck in FC for a long time. That should be counted against any
potential profit. In my experience, the returns have still been much
better than a bank, so I don’t regret it, I’m just a little annoyed that
I am unable to close the account properly.</p>
