    <p>A couple of weeks after travelling to <a href="/blog/2025/04/sri-lanka.html">Sri Lanka</a>, I went a few hours south to spend a long weekend in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunbury,_Western_Australia">Bunbury</a> and its surrounds. It is amazing how it becomes noticeably cooler and greener with such just a short journey. Walking around Bunbury is easy and pretty, although you are finished quickly since the town is surprisingly small. There is one main street, a couple of malls and a couple of streets full of big box stores. Restaurant selection is limited. The farmers market is still a great food-only supermarket. Prices seemed largely the same as Perth. Overall it felt like a large successful country town, which I suppose it is.</p>

<p>Other places visited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnybrook,_Western_Australia">Donnybrook</a> Apple Festival is very popular, it felt like there were thousands of visitors taking over this small town! And it does not seem to have much to do with apples - there was just a single stall selling apples (very tasty!) and few others selling “related” products. The event seems like a cross between a small agricultural show and and a large standard market.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australind,_Western_Australia">Australind</a> felt like a commuter suburb. There was a nice Italian restaurant though (forgotten its name).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busselton">Busselton</a> has become a tourist town. Despite being much smaller, the main shopping street was nearly as large as Bunbury’s. However, the shops there felt like they were mostly for visitors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/bunbury_25.html">available here</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>At the star of April I spent a fortnight in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> for a wedding. Perhaps half the time was spent on travelling (see below) and the wedding activities, but we managed some sightseeing along the way. Overall it seems like a nice place to visit, although I’m in no rush to go back (despite missing some good stuff like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigiriya">Sigiriya</a>). People have said it is similar to the Bali of 30 years ago. I can see that, it seems to be a good place to relax by the beach. Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are surprisingly few restaurants everywhere we went (except the Negombo tourist strip). We probably only had 3 meals at local eateries, and that took some effort. I thought perhaps they were there, but I wasn’t looking for the right signs. However, I checked with various online maps, then confirmed by talking to locals and other tourists. Apparently Sri Lankans don’t tend to eat out often and tourists spend most of their time at touristy places (so outside those places good luck!).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo">Colombo</a> is jarring mix of run down building and new towers, often very close to eachother.</li>
  <li>You are dangerously gem deficient! Walking around the capital we were regularly approached by initially friendly men who quickly told us that we were lucky to be in town that day as there was a special one-day only sale at the best gem store in town. We must go! This was over many different days and stores. One was a little aggressive, but all eventually accepted we weren’t going anywhere with them.</li>
  <li>Expect to pay more as a non-local, sometimes by a lot. For example, when a taxi wanted more from us than a equivalent Australian taxi (which are not cheap) we tried Uber and got a car at tenth of the asking price.</li>
  <li>Security sometimes can be very tight, other times non-existent. Going into hotels and shopping malls we went through metal detectors and bag checks. However, other places like train stations had no security, often not even a ticket check. There was no visible security on the streets either (although it still felt safe). Presumably this is a holdover from the long finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_civil_war">civil war</a> and more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Sri_Lankan_protests">recent protests</a>.</li>
  <li>The train network is extensive and amazingly cheap, but incredibly slow and often delayed. Don’t be overly concerned about going in the lower classes as long as you have a set seat. We went in reserved 3rd class for one trip - it was fine and was not that much worse than 1st (no A/C, but we had the windows open). Overall we spent two nearly entire days travelling a few hundred kilometers and back again.</li>
  <li>The surrounds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatton,_Sri_Lanka">Hatton</a> are pretty (not so much the town itself), but there is not much else. The main site seems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Peak">Adam’s Peak</a> a sacred site at the top of a mountain and the destination for a lot of internal tourism. It is extremely busy!</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negombo">Negombo</a> has a strip along the beach full of bars, restaurants, hotels, and shops of local arts. It seemed pleasant but definitely tourist focused. We had a very good fish meal there in a restaurant just off the strip on our last night.</li>
  <li>It was hard to find good flights to Sri Lanka. Avoiding budget airlines and overly long flights meant we had two options. Both arrived and departed near midnight. Relatively cheap though.</li>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I regularly find interesting webpages that I want to record for later viewing. Over time I fill in browser bookmarks or text documents full of them.  They tend to become lost with changes in computer or other problems. Most recently with a harddrive crash a few months ago (no important data was lost, but transient files like these bookmarks were unrecoverable). So I have decided to follow the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">advice from here</a> to create a link blog, or at least the occasional post of links. Hopefully they will sick around a bit longer that way.  I’ll try to group links based on themes (gamedev, technical, finance, …) to allow for easier search later. Also, I will not post any paywalled links, replacing them with archive links if possible.</p>

<p>So to start, here are some sci-fi and history links…</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Nemorensis">Rex Nemorensis</a> (Wikipedia) - In the early Roman Empire there was a priest at a small glade near Rome. To gain this position a slave had to escape, make their way to the glade, break a branch from a sacred tree, and then engage the current priest in a fight to the death. Wild.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.thebyzantinelegacy.com/">The Byzantine Legacy</a> - maps/pictures/diagrams of Byzantine sites.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tenochtitlan.thomaskole.nl/">A Portrait of Tenochtitlan</a> - artistic reconstructions of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, at the time of European contact, based on current research. I enjoy looking at maps of old cities trying to imagine what they were like, and this is a step up from that. See also the paintings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaletto">Canaletto</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/03/flooded-quarry-mysterious-millionaire-and-dream-new-atlantis-welsh-border-deep">A flooded quarry, a mysterious millionaire and the dream of a new Atlantis</a> (The Guardian) - I always find it surprising there isn’t more of this sort of thing compared to people trying to live on Mars. The bottom of the ocean is far more habitable than anywhere outside Earth (better water supply, better radiation protection, closer proximity to support, better gravity, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-sci-fi-movies-science-fiction-film-1201817994/">The 65 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 21st Century</a> - Yes, it’s linkbait, but it’s a good list. I’ve seen the vast majority of the films, and most of the rest I know about and don’t want to see, but still a couple went on my watch list. It has some good uncommon films (like Endless). While they definitely deserve to be somewhere on the list, I wouldn’t put Nope, Under The Skin, and The Host in the top 10 (perhaps replacing them with Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival - although that would make it Villeneuve heavy).</li>
  <li><a href="https://archive.is/iifrP">Angry workers use AI to bombard businesses with employment lawsuits</a> (archive link to bypass the Telegraph paywall) - Following on from the sci-fi above, a while ago I read Accelerando, an interesting Charlie Stross book where AGI evolves from legal and accounting computer systems. This colours the way they act, so the singularity plays out with highspeed legal warfare. This article reminded me of that.</li>

  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="/blog/2024/01/goals.html">Last year’s goals</a> were a little unambitious (apart from the Ci2D one), so I mostly did ok…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return to a decent level of fitness and strength</strong>: Technically I think I achieved this goal. I am fitter and stronger than this time last year, but barely. It turned out my shoulder was not as healed as I believed at the start of 2024, and it quickly came to limit my ability to exercise at anything other than a maintenance level. And that is where I stayed all year.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve Spanish</strong>: I have kept this up all year, just doing a little bit nearly every day, and I have improved. I’m definitely not fluent, but getting slowly better.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to 3D print (and then paint the result)</strong>: I have printed so much stuff and now have a large grey pile of shame. I know what I’m doing with the printer, and can do supports and simple maintenance without issue. Next up: learn to design my own models.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>: 15 posts. Failed the easiest goal! Mostly because gamedev work stalled out, so I didn’t have many JarrahTech posts. I have discovered I don’t feel particularly disappointed about not making this goal, which is a good sign it shouldn’t be one in future.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo quality Ci2D</strong>: I got distracted at the start of year by a webapp idea and taught myself Javascript to write it. The other 9 months I was just lazy.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year’s goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return to a decent level of fitness and strength</strong>: Same as last year. Once again I think my shoulder is improving, so time to try testing it a little (when the temperature drops in my outdoor gym). <em>Fingers crossed</em></li>
  <li><strong>Improve Spanish</strong>: If I continue with a few minutes each day, I won’t get worse. I’ve managed that for over a year now. With a occasionally little bit more and continuing the grammar drills I’ve started doing in the last few weeks, I should continue to improve.</li>
  <li><strong>Start Ci2D</strong>: Just starting would be good, it has been too long!</li>
  <li><strong>Modelling for 3D printing</strong>: Being able to print is nice, but the real benefits will come if I can model my own designs and then print them. Just need to relearn Blender and give it a go.</li>
  <li><strong>Read books</strong>: In December I started reading books again (borrowed from the local library). I started with the entertaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries">Murderbot</a> series (one left). There are so many more interesting books from the list I compiled over the last few years available at the library. I should read some. I’ll set a target of 12, one per month.</li>

Over 2024, I played 31 different games a total of 69 times. A high-water mark I doubt I’ll challenge this year (unless my online boardgame playing really expands).

<p>Most of the Battletech games were played at various local clubs. Many of the rest were played at the monthly Strategy Boardgame WA club. Although there are a few from meetups with the WA Boardgame Association and one from the local 18XX aficionados (my unofficial name) meetup. This year I also started playing online - all the games of Nevsky, 18GA and two of the Shikoku 1889 games were played online at <a href="https://www.rally-the-troops.com/">Rally the Troops</a> or <a href="https://18xx.games/">18XX.games</a>. I had previously tried playing online with Vassal and was unimpressed, but these new websites are much better. Also, after having played a few solo games I don’t think they are for me. I find myself taking advantage of the simplicity or lack of creativity of my cardboard opponent in a way that does not translate well to playing against humans. Playing online seems a better option, or playing computer games specifically designed for solo play.</p>

<p>This year I sold two games: 7th Continent (too repetitive and long) and Arkham Horror (not able to get it to the table other than solo). I acquired a bunch of games - a few I purchased, but more as gifts. Only one of these I managed to play during the year: Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients. So there is a replenished list of owned but unplayed games I need to reduce. I am considering selling a few more games as they seem hard to get people to play, so I always forget the rules in the year or two between plays: Falling Sky; High Frontier; and Twilight Struggle. However, I’m leaning towards keeping them at the moment.</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts on some games I played multiple times this year, and haven’t previously reviewed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nevsky</strong>: Brutal and unforgiving wargame set in during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1240_Izborsk_and_Pskov_campaign">Teutonic invasion of Novgorod in the 13th century</a>. This game requires and rewards careful planning of supply lines, equipment and an army’s length of service. Then winter comes and makes it all even harder. Also has an interesting command system so that if your plans go awry, you may have to pass a few turns until resetting. This is a clever game, that feels true to its setting, but I’m not sure it is a fun game for me. I’ll try to give it another go in a few months.</li>
  <li><strong>Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients</strong>: Fast block-based wargame set during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punic_Wars">Punic wars</a>, that has a card-based command system limiting your power to do things. A charge on the left flank may win the game, but if you don’t have a card that allows you to perform that charge then tough luck. Fun.</li>
  <li><strong>Conquest of Paradise</strong>: This is a very interesting and enjoyable game. A fast-playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X">4X</a> set during the polynesian expansion with random island placement. There is a strong emphasis on the first two X’s: explore and expand. The 4th X, extermination, is rare - in the 3 games I played there were only 2 battles, both as the final game winning action. I saw more battles avoided through a dance-off!</li>
  <li><strong>Viticulture</strong>: Eurostyle worker placement game about the winemaking process. I played a few of these this year. This was probably the most enjoyable, but they were all quite similar and fun.</li>
  <li><strong>Falling Sky</strong>: Asymmetric wargame set in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars">Gallic Wars</a>. Long and complicated. It requires a great deal of concentration, which I like, but is corresponding hard to get people to play.</li>
  <li><strong>Shikoku 1889</strong>: A relatively gentle introduction to the generally unforgiving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX">18XX</a> genre. Build railways at the start of the industrial revolution, with the aim of maximising your personal wealth (as opposed to the railway companies’ wealth). These games have some clever tabletop implementation of financial concepts (like companies, IPOs and debt). I will have to try more of these.</li>
  <li><strong>Agricola: ACGAS</strong>: 2-player worker placement game. A smaller version of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a> (which I haven’t played). Very little player interaction, as you build up a small medieval farm. Now we have played a few times it largely always plays out the same way. Fun, but perhaps a little too limited.</li>
  <li><strong>Pax Pamir</strong>: I read the rules before playing this each time, yet still after 2 games I don’t know what is happening during the game. This tableau builder set in the historical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Game">Afghani Great Game</a> seems simple, but that belies quite a bit of depth and strategy. An experienced player easily defeats a newbie. Do I want to put the effort in to be a good player? Not sure.</li>
  <li><strong>El Grande</strong>: I played this at WABA. A very interesting area control/hand management game with some special and hidden actions. After two games I hadn’t worked out a good strategy, at least not against my opponents. I like the initiative deck system where each player choses a unique starting priority (unique both across all players in a round, and across all rounds by a player) - high priority and you start first, but get few resources, or vice versa. I was less keen on the hidden units in the castille, but then I’m not a fan of memory tests. A good game, I’d definitely play again.</li>
  <li><strong>Arkham Horror</strong>: Coop cardgame which attempts to tell a Lovecraftian horror adventure story. I just played the introductory campaign that comes in the box, but many more can be bought as expansions. It is definitely grim and difficult. The game doesn’t care about your success and negative effects (and some positive) persist through the game so failure or compromise seems inevitable. Thus the theme is well captured. I like: that cards are dual use (for points or ability); the chitpull modifier system; and, that the story advances along two sequences (your story and the opponents plan). I like less that the story is fixed, so after playing it once it gets easier as you know what is happening and what to do. This is not as prominent as in 7th Continent, as each mission in Arkham is probably only played a few times and changes completely for a new mission (unlike 7th where most of the cards are the same across curses, so you do them over and over again). Replayability is enhanced by the expansions, but the cost adds up quickly. Still if my usual game group were interested then I would buy and play them, but (being keen on winning and not keen on coop) they are not interested.</li>
