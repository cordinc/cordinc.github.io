    <p>I’m just back from a week in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane">Brisbane</a> (or more like 5 days when travel days are taken into account). It is worth visiting, but I don’t feel any need to return (is this how people feel about Perth?). It seems like a city for living. We spent most of time walking around the city and just hanging out. Surprisingly pleasant thing to do as long as one doesn’t travel too far into the suburbs. The city makes decent (but not great) use of its river. There are good crowds in the CBD, good public transport - it all felt safe. A nice trip.</p>

<p>We also spent a day on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast,_Queensland">Gold Coast</a> and my thoughts of that city are less favourable. It felt sterile and empty, like a retirement village. However, many of the shops and bars suggest a beach &amp; alcohol centred holiday resort (like parts of Spain, not my sort of thing). So maybe it was quiet because it was a working winter’s day.</p>

<p>Not enough good photos to create a slideshow of this trip. I rarely felt the need to take a photo.</p>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-61401626">iPod is no more</a>, long live the iPod. My first iPod was a second generation model bought in early 2003. Since then I have always had one, my third and last was a leaving gift from teammates at Merrill Lynch in December 2007 (such a great gift). Despite currently poor battery life, it is still running (in near daily use) as the music/podcast system for my car (see pic below).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/last_ipod.png" alt="My last iPod" title="My last iPod" /></p>

<p>I loved all of my iPods, even the short-lived second one that had battery issues from purchase and was quickly replaced by the improved 2007 model. I like to walk around aimlessly, so have always carried a means of listening to music on-the-go. However, the iPod with its small size and large capacity proved to be a step-change in quality compared to old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walkman">Walkmans</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discman">Discmans</a> or just a radio. They gave me the time to listen to great music and my first taste of a world of interesting podcasts.</p>

<p>It is sad that they have fallen foul of mobile phones’ hunger for new functionality. RIP my old friend, at least until a nostalgic return in a decade or two.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Late last month (scheduled to avoid school holidays) I went on a week’s holiday. Three nights in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperance,_Western_Australia">Esperance</a>, and 3 nights on the journey there and back.</p>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I expected to be unimpressed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Rock">Wave Rock</a>. While the rock itself is largely as expected and will be largely “done” in a matter of minutes, the surrounding area has a few other interesting sights and walks. Well worth spending a day checking the place out.</li>
  <li>The size of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatbelt_(Western_Australia)">wheatbelt</a> is astounding. We could drive for hours (often speeding) for 2 days only seeing continuous wheat fields broken occasionally by huge “bins” (horizontal wheat silos) and even more rarely by a tiny town.</li>
  <li>Esperance is larger, greener and further than expected (again). It is a decent sized town with enough local industry to maintain itself - it is not just a tourist town (but there is a decent amount of that). I have this idea that the desert starts not far from Perth, and nearly no one lives out there. Clearly this is not true, although it took long days of driving to get to Esperance, and we passed very little on the way other than dry’ish farmland.</li>
  <li>Tourist Esperance is mainly about spending time outside. There are so many beautiful beaches we became numb to them by the end.</li>
  <li>It was incredibly and constantly windy for our entire time in Esperance.</li>
  <li>If <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albany,_Western_Australia">Albany</a> harbour was in Europe or China I’m sure it would be the base of a famous or historical town. It definitely looks like it should be full of tall ships or triremes.</li>
  <li>Restaurant food continues to be disappointing outside Perth and a couple of tourist towns. We had one good (and one decent) restaurant meal on the entire trip - the rest were poor.</li>
  <li>IPhones take decent photos! All the photos here were taken on phones despite having my old trusty point &amp; click camera. It is hard to justify taking the extra device when the phone does so well. I suspect just discovering this means I am years behind the times.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/esperance_22.html">available here</a>.</p>

    <p>Starting as a teenager and continuing into my 20’s I had occasionally recurring dream of going up the Swan River from Perth (where I grew up). Within a few twists and turns it would quickly transform from urban city into wild bush with high river banks. Then I would arrive at a wonderful water funpark in the middle of this wilderness. I never thought much of it.</p>

<p>Recently I moved back to Perth. Now I live in Maylands, just a few kilometres from the city centre. Part of this area is a pennisula into a curve of the Swan River. Soon after moving in I went for a walk down to the river and immediately had a sense of deja vu. The area around the river is a park giving way to a swamp before the water, and on the other side are high banks with trees and modern apartment blocks poking up over the top.  It reminded me of more realistic version of that dream (if the apartment blocks were gone).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/dreamscape1.png" alt="Maylands Pennisula" title="Maylands Pennisula" /></p>

<p>And then I saw the water park. It is clearly for small children - just some shallow pools and small slides. No photos as it is currently under reconstruction and mostly just looks like a building site. Presumably that dream must have been based on a real (and probably happy?) visit to this place when I was a very young. Forgotten consciously, it lived on in slumbering fantasy.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Some recent news on AI advances had me thinking about the implications and reminiscing on my own work in that area. Google’s new large language model named <a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/04/pathways-language-model-palm-scaling-to.html">Pathways</a> is the current trigger. Its results are impressive. I find its ability to reason about language almost incredible.</p>

<p>My views are definitely hot-takes as I am no longer an AI professional. Even when I was, I worked a long way from the pointy end that gets written up in research papers. Reader beware, the following could be bollocks. Still I’m not quite as shrill as <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wrkEnGrTTrM2mnmGa/retracted-it-s-time-for-ea-leadership-to-pull-the-short">this hot-take</a> but probably not as thoughtful as <a href="https://twitter.com/russelljkaplan/status/1513128005828165634">these tweets</a> either.</p>

<p>For reference, I did my undergrad thesis on neural nets in the mid-90s (just as they were going out of fashion again) and then worked on logic programming for postgrad research (as symbolic techniques were popular at the time). Most of my professional career has not been AI related - until 2018 when I worked for a company using older machine learning techniques to analyse financial market research (I left in 2020). However, I have kept an interested eye on the field the whole time.</p>

<p>So my thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improvement in AI models remain much worse than non-linear. It is a particulary bugbear of mine when people suggest making an AI twice as “smart” would only be twice as hard (a common argument amoung non-technical singularity advocates). Nope, twice as good is more like 1000x as hard or worse. When doing logic research I counted myself lucky if the algorithms were merely of exponential complexity. Current researchers are throwing exponentially (at least) more hardware and resources at these problems to get incremental changes. Only the largest and incredibly well financed organisations can hope to compete.</li>
  <li>Connectionist systems FTW. The history of AI has seen many swings between connectionist and symbolic techniques. However, with the improvement in neural networks since the advent of deep learning in the 2000’s, Team Connectionist is ascendant and for so long with no change in sight. The computational logic parts of CS departments must be in heavy decline.</li>
  <li>No whiff of consciousneess. When I swapped from neural nets into logic systems it was because I was unimpressed by them as just complex statistical inference. I still hold that opinion, but the results can’t be ignored. Now Pathways can do basic logical inference out of its connections. The conflation of intelligence and consiousness is under attack. It will be interesting to see where the final line is drawn as the importance of consciousness decreases.</li>
  <li>Language as root of functional intelligence? All these great results are coming out of language models. Is that because there is a fundamental link between communication and intelligence? Or is it simply because that is where researchers focus their attention? I don’t know.</li>
</ul>
