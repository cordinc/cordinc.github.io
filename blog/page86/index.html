  <div class="content">
    <p>After having the simple startup idea (see
<a href="/blog/2008/02/ideas.html">here</a>) over the New Year holiday, I next
needed to decide how to implement it. Many people would say I needed to
write design/spec/use case documents first, but for this project I think
best to start working and see what happens. It would be easy to draw
diagrams and think about problems with nifty solutions. However, the
main goal is to DELIVER. I want to get something up and running quickly,
get some people to use it and then improve it. I believe the longer it
takes to get something up in front of people, the more likely I never
will reach that point or go further. Having people use the system (even
as testers) is a form of commitment.</p>

<p>As a result I chose to use <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>
for development - something many people who know me may find surprising.
I have never programmed in Ruby before, so I’m learning it at the same
time as trying to quickly develop a new system with fuzzy requirements.
What happened to avoiding development risks and not trying to do too
much at once? If I did a project risk assessment like most of my
previous employers this would raise some serious red flags - the project
would not be allowed to go ahead. Although, no previous employer would
allow my idea to go ahead anyway, they would see it as too small. So why
did I make the Ruby decision?</p>

<p>For the last 6 years I have almost entirely developed in Java (and
before that a mix of Java, C<span class="underline"></span> and other
languages that will never appear on my resume). I have worked on
developing a wide range of systems from the large (over 100 people for a
few years) to the very small (just me for a couple of weeks), although
mainly for large financial firms. However, I specifically did not want
to develop in Java. I may be faster in Java, but there are a number of
reasons I thought it best not use it this time. People say it can be
heavier to develop, with more boilerplate code, and I can certainly
understand that. There are also less decent internet hosting options for
Java, nearly every hosting firm provides PHP or Ruby options, but
finding a good Java host is harder. However, the main reason for me was
that with Java I was liable to get bogged down in the intricacies of the
language and various libraries or third party tools. With a new language
I wouldn’t have time to think further than the next problem I was facing
and finding a solution for it - there would be fewer distractions simply
because there wouldn’t be time to lose focus or investigate interesting
side issues.</p>

<p>Choosing the language was difficult. There were so many I wanted to try
as I haven’t properly taught myself new language since C# some years
ago. I have been reading (with interest) blog posts arguing (flaming?)
the pros and cons of various web development languages and frameworks.
Ruby on Rails seems to have a large following and been around for a
while. The basic idea has been copied so many times by other languages
(<a href="http://grails.org/">Groovy on Rails</a>, <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/12/codes-worst-enemy.html">Rhino on
Rails</a>,
…) that I felt there must be something useful in there. I rejected all
the derivatives because I didn’t think they would be mature enough yet
and didn’t have a large enough community behind them. After all a
framework with a
<a href="http://www.zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">backlash</a> must
have reached a certain level of maturity! The <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/12.html">speed
issue</a> was my main
concern. At work code execution speed is extremely important and has a
direct affect on the bottom line (I work on financial trading systems).
However, the performance requirements for my system are far less than at
work. Ruby will probably be fast enough - or at least fast enough at the
start to see if the idea is worth pursuing. So I decided to just give
Ruby a try. If it didn’t work out I could quickly move onto something
else.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’ve been writing Ruby on Rails code for nearly the last two
months in my spare time - probably only the equivalent of only a handful
of workdays in total. Yet I am quite impressed by how much functionality
I have implemented. I am probably only a couple of weeks away from being
ready for alpha testing on the functionality (the website design is
still a mess). So far I have to say that Ruby on Rails has been a
positive experience, although I am yet to properly test its performance.</p>

    <p>I have been writing this blog for almost a month and have signed up for
various tools, including <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/home">Google Web
Analytics</a>. I originally signed up
to learn how they work for my startup idea (more about that soon, I
promise), but now I think they are just cool.</p>

<p>For instance, thanks to analytics I know that 3 people regularly visit
my blog and two of them are me! I also know that on the 26th of
February, someone at Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho, typed “weird in
sign language” into google and came to my blog post about the sign
language for being bitten by an alligator. Obviously it wasn’t quite
what they were expecting so they left after a few seconds. For some
reason that little bit of knowledge puts a smile on my face.</p>

<p>FYI, the American Sign Language for “weird” is
<a href="http://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-signs/o/odd.htm">here</a>, and
that’s cool too.</p>

    <p>I don’t have a home phone line, so until recently I used open wifi
points to access the internet. Seeing a large number of ads for mobile
broadband modems (modems that connect to the mobile phone network) I
thought I could improve my connection’s reliability and expense.</p>

<p>I bought a Pay As You Go Huawei E220 USB modem from 3, advertised as
very simple to use, and plugged it in. It didn’t work. At this point my
biggest mistake was calling the 3 support line - what a dismal
experience! The support people kept me waiting for ages and suggested
clearly stupid solutions. They refused to listen to my reasons why their
obviously wrong suggestions wouldn’t work and seemed eager to end the
call. I made them wait for me to try their solution, and when it didn’t
work, the cycle repeated (starting with the wait while on hold). After
about half an hour I gave up on them. The next morning I was angry and
determined to return the modem for a refund. However, I tried a quick
google search at work first and found <a href="http://lifeinriyadh.blogspot.com/2007/10/life-in-riyadh.html">the
answer</a> -
it seems these modems do not play nicely with others. I disabled my
laptop’s internal modem and the Huawei modem has worked fine since.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m happy with my purchase, but very unhappy with 3. Internal
modems are common and to have conflicts with them would, in my mind,
preclude claiming something as plug and play. I will never call the 3
support line again - I found them hopeless (why not just have them
search google?). Since my dealings with 3 I have found <a href="http://aonach.com/chatter/how-i-solved-all-my-3-three-wireless-data-modem-problems/">others with
similar
problems</a>.
YMMV.</p>

    <p>Logically bad arguments are annoying. It is almost as annoying when
people argue that a premise is clear when it is not. Often people make
assumptions about their argument’s starting points, perhaps to avoid
examining the implications of their premise. Sometimes this is done for
rhetorical reasons (they just want to win an argument - politicians seem
particularly guilty of this). Other times it appears to be due to a lack
of thought.</p>

<p>That small rant was prompted by a segment on breakfast TV about
performance-enhancing drugs. The premise was that performance-enhancing
drugs were unfair and how hard they were to detect. Why it was unfair
was never examined. The situation may well be unfair, and being a fan of
cycling I mourn the damage drugs have done to that sport. However, what
caught my attention was the background of the presenter. He was a UK
Olympic gold medallist in rowing. Many people would consider such a
person eminently qualified to talk about fairness in sport. I would not
be so sure.</p>

<p>One of my earliest memories of the Olympics was watching the cycling
team time trial, a 100km 4-member team race against the clock. The
competitive teams were on the latest expensive bicycles costing
thousands and had been in intensive high-tech training camps to ensure
their best performance. Then the Ethiopian team was shown. Their bikes
were clearly of a much older and cheaper design - lacking all the
aerodynamic finery necessary in modern cycling. They had no chance in
the race. Is it unfair that the Ethiopians were not as competitive as
others because they had worse technology? Is it unfair that having more
money spent on an athlete (in support, training, a high-tech bike or
better boat) makes them more likely to win?</p>

<p>It may be possible to say that the best athlete at the start of the
competition has the best chance of winning. However, drugs and money
give a distinct and often insurmountable advantage before the
competition begins. Drugs and money distort the playing field from the
very start and always have. The breakfast TV presenter benefitted
greatly from this situation. While people suggest a complete ban on
performance-enhancing drugs for the sake of fairness (at least on this
breakfast TV show), there is no similar call for fairness in money. It
could be argued that money fairness is impractical and could not be
enforced, but that’s not the point (incidentally HGH use can’t be
detected and thus its ban can’t be enforced at present).</p>

<p>If fairness is defined as all have the same chance of winning at the
start, then competitive sport is inherently unfair. I’m not sure that is
a bad thing - I certainly don’t have a problem with it. The best have
advantages (I haven’t even touched on the concept of genetic unfairness)
and that should just be accepted, it is the nature of the competition. I
would prefer to see a different argument against performance-enhancing
drugs.</p>

    <p>I’m a lapsed fan of sci-fi novels. It has been a while since I last read
one which caused as much thought as Neuromancer or The Foundation series
or the early Culture books. The last sci-fi book I read, the Algebraist,
just didn’t cut it. I’ve also found myself outside circles where
recommendations are readily available, so reading <a href="http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/top_10_science_.html">Marc Andreessen’s
modern top 10 sci-fi authors blog
post</a> piqued my
interest and I think I may be trying a few of them out soon.</p>

<p>The description of some of the books as
<a href="http://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html">post-Singularity</a>
caught my attention. It is a very interesting idea and reminded my of
the first time I heard of the concept while reading Diaspora by Greg
Egan (from my home town of Perth). The book was lent to me by a
workmate, Dale (I can’t remember his surname). At the time it made
little impression on me at all - I think I told Dale I found it cold.
However, memories of the story have stayed with me for many years now
and I often think about the ideas I first encountered reading it.</p>

<p>Sorry Dale, you are right, Diaspora is a good book.</p>
