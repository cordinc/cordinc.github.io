    <p>The end is near. No not the end of this blog. The end of my time in
London. In a couple of days I will be on a plane to South-East Asia.
Most of the luggage has already left. I’m in that weird disconnected
in-between state where I’m not sure what I should be doing. In any case,
this blog may be neglected for the next couple of weeks as I complete
the move and discover first-hand how good Internet access is in
Malaysia. I have heard it is very good and hope to be back soon. Until
then, goodbye.</p>

    <p>Britain has two postal systems. The main one is the well known <a href="http://www.royalmail.com">Royal
Mail</a>. The vast majority of mail goes through
this system and uses the standard UK postcode system. If you have sent
mail to or from Britain, this is almost certainly the system you have
used. The other system is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Forces_Post_Office">British Forces Post Office
(BFPO)</a>. It is
for sending post to British Forces abroad. Technically this means it
predates the Royal Mail, as the first English postal system was set up
for English soldiers in Scotland or France. The idea is that you send
mail to the BFPO address in Britain and then the government will ensure
it reaches the appropriate person around the world without handing it
over to anyone outside the British government. Normally this means the
military delivers it, but it can also go through diplomatic or foreign
office channels.</p>

<p>BFPO address look quite different to Royal Mail address. They just have
the addressee’s name, their id code and the BFPO Code. Sometimes a
postcode is appended for getting through some mail systems, <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ha4+6ep">HA4
6EP</a> - check it out. For
example BFPO 792 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bastion">Camp
Bastion</a> in Afghanistan, BFPO
305 is the navy ship
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Illustrious_(R06)">HMS
Illustrious</a> and BFPO 5439 is the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.
That last one is my new address and thus I have discovered the great
problem with BFPO addresses. Very few people seem to know how they work.
To all UK (and to a lesser extent, worldwide) web developers, there is
more than one UK post system - please handle it! In particular, pooks to
you HSBC - I expected better from an “international” bank.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep">A Fire Upon The
Deep</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Fraction">The Star
Fraction</a>. Both are
science-fiction novels written in the early-mid 1990’s by authors with a
computer science background, and both share (as part of the background
context) a somewhat antiquated concern with network bandwidth. A Fire
Upon The Deep is a rollicking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera">space
opera</a> - an exciting and fast
paced adventure containing many interesting ideas. The Star Fraction is
a near future tale of a possible singularity event (largely avoided) and
wasn’t nearly as enjoyable due to a dominant preoccupation with politics
that didn’t flow nicely with the action.</p>

<p>Both novels feature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet-like</a>
communication and both fret at points about having enough bandwidth. I
think Star Fraction even makes a reference to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a> at
one point. Younger readers might wonder what I’m talking about. In the
early 90’s the dominant forms of communication on the Internet were
email and Usenet. The Web had just been developed, but had not yet
gained popularity, and it was competing with the similar Gopher
technology. Usenet was a system of discussion groups like modern message
forums (e.g. Reddit), but much more primitive. At the time bandwidth was
severely limited and often a concern. For playing a text-only online
game in 1992, I was banned from a computer system for excessive
bandwidth usage amounting to a few hundred kilobytes over several hours!
Email has survived, but Usenet and Gopher have both been superseded by
the more flexible Web. Bandwidth has risen to the level where HD movies
(measured in gigabytes) can easily be watched online.</p>

<p>I can imagine both authors were blinded by their closeness to their
contemporary technology to see the revolutionary change about to occur.
Thus their books are now quaintly dated. It is interesting to compare
this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>. Written
a decade earlier than the other novels and dealing heavily with computer
networks, it hasn’t aged too badly with its portrayal of cyberspace (a
term first coined in the book), despite being written by someone with
little background in computing. In an interview the author states that
the Net as depicted in Neuromancer was a metaphor for the media, but it
still works. Evidence of the cliche that being too much of an expert can
cloud your powers of extrapolation.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is an interesting language to a Java
programmer that wishes they were doing more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional
Programming</a>. As
such a person, when I saw <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> hosting a
course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming Principles In
Scala</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky">Martin
Odersky</a> (Scala’s creator),
I immediately signed up for both the site and course. Coursera is one of
the new online education websites. They partner with various
universities around the world and and run their courses over the web.
They have some impressive courses including an AI course by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">Peter
Norvig</a> and an Algorithms
course by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">Robert
Sedgewick</a>.</p>

<p>The Scala course was 7 weeks long and took between 3 &amp; 8 hours a week to
complete (the first week was 3 hours and the last 8 hours). Each week
consisted of an hour or two of lectures (broken into 10-20 minutes
chunks) and a machine graded assignment. There was no final exam. The
lectures were a good introduction to functional programming, but did
appear to assume some programming ability (fine by me). Scala is not a
pure functional language, but the course presented as pure a subset as
possible, using immutable data structures and only the occasionally
<code class="highlighter-rouge">println</code> as the only side-effect. It seems the language has either
greatly improved since I first used it in 2008/9 or I completely missed
the best bits back then. Now Martin covered all the stuff I remember
loving about Haskell back when I was university: lazy evaluation;
partial evaluation or currying; for/list comprehensions; and pattern
matching (although only for <code class="highlighter-rouge">case</code> classes in Scala). The language
definitely deserves another look, especially since the tooling with
Eclipse is definitely much better now. I imagine my old <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/combinatorial-iterators-in-jav.html">Scala
combinatorial iterator
test</a>
would be much better with lazy list comprehensions.</p>

<p>Completing weekly assignments was definitely a mixed blessing. The only
difference between this course and just finding Scala tutorials on the
web was the quality of the teaching and the assignments. The assignments
reinforced that week’s concepts. However, sometimes it was hard to find
time to do them, as they are due a week after being released. Generally
though they weren’t too hard, although the last one took me around 6
hours. The assignments were graded automatically, I imagine that is the
only way thousands of assignments could be marked in the required
timeframe. Unfortunately this meant that there was little feedback other
than a overall grade and an indication of where marks were lost. Marks
were gained for passing unit tests and some syntactic tests to ensure
good code style. This means it was possible to write a less than optimal
solution, but still get full marks and no feedback as how to do it
better. I’m certain that a couple of points my answers were clumsy
implementations - I felt there must be a better way, but got no
direction as to what that could be. In this way the course can only take
you to a certain level of expertise.</p>

<p>The assignments can also be submitted as many times as desired and each
submission is graded. This made it easy to keep going until achieving
100% (as I did in each assignment). It also made me lazy. Rather than
write proper tests, I just relied on the automatic grading system. If it
said I got the question right, who am I to argue? I think the course
coordinators may have noticed students doing this during the course as
the last assignment required us to write a couple of our own tests.</p>

<p>The lack of human interaction with lecturers or other teaching staff
could be a real problem and I think this the largest issue holding back
large-scale online education. I enjoyed the course and got good marks,
but it would have been easy for me to cheat (I didn’t). I can’t believe
that a significant percentage of students wouldn’t have cheated.
Cheating was rampant when I marked university assignments and every
single one was checked by hand (which the students knew). Now with just
machine checking, it must be easier to get away with it on such simple
assignments (where the number of possible solutions is relatively low).
Harder assignments would require prohibitive amounts of time to mark.</p>

<p>Most of the problems are for Coursera in increasing the legitimacy of
their courses. I just wanted to refresh my Functional Programming
knowledge and learn Scala. Thus, I am very happy with the course and
achieved my goals. Having just completed one course I would happily sign
up for another if it caught my eye (time allowing).</p>
