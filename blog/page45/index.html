  <div class="content">
    <p>This excellent game is evil. It is a succubus come to drain your time
away. After a few little abortive starts just to learn the rules I
played a proper game all the way from 1066 to 1453. It took over 70
hours! And I could easily play it again (indeed I plan to do so, just
not for a while).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_II">Crusader Kings II</a>
you take the role of a Count, Duke, King or Emperor and their heirs.
Guiding them through the years in dealing with their liege (if any),
their vassals, crusades, jihads, and the Mongol invasion. There is no
imposed winning criteria, players can make their own goals: create a
large empire; conquer Spain for Christendom; participate in the
Crusades. There is also DLC for playing Muslim for Byzantine players,
but I haven’t tried them yet.</p>

<p>The game is strategic in nature. Battles are fought when two opposing
armies occupy the same county and the outcome is determined
automatically by the computer. Instead gameplay is about keeping your
vassals from revolt, handling your court and most importantly ensuring a
smooth succession for your heir. Conquest revolves around finding a
reason to declare war (you have to have a valid reason) and then the
logistics of building and positioning your forces. Definitely more a
thinking and planning game.</p>

<p>The epic nature of the game lends itself to player created stories
spanning generations. RockPaperShotgun started <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/02/an-iberian-winter-crusader-kings-ii-diary-part-one/">such a
series</a>,
but it seems to have stopped after a single episode. I found myself
constructing a narrative of the mad Count Loinsech’s quest to unify
Ireland. His Mongol descendents completing the conquest of all
Britannia. Below is how the game ended at 1453 (the game-enforced forced
end-date). Count Loinsech of Munster’s heirs 12 generations later
control all of Britannia and southern Norway. Relatives also rule over
Denmark, Poland, Finland and what is left of France.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/CK2_end.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/CK2_end.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>During this game the three big tasks were succession planning, war
planning and placating or defeating my vassals. Every time my current
ruler died, their vassals would become unhappy. Large scale revolts
often resulted if the new ruler was unable to immediately stamp their
authority. Queen Lann the Cruel spent nearly her entire 12 year reign
putting down revolts in Scotland and Wales, largely because she was a
women with a female heir and my vassals were misogynists (a viewpoint
probably strengthend after they spent the last few years of their lives
in her dungeon). Patrick the Unready took 10 years to pacify his
subjects after ascending to the throne at the age of 8. This was despite
preparing for the event by hiring thousands of mercenaries and
positioning them near the worst troublemakers (I’m looking at you Duke
of Cornwall and Duke of Galloway).</p>

<p>To help avoid revolt upon succession, careful planning is required
(although a large, well funded army doesn’t hurt). This means marrying
well, ensuring your heirs are well-educated and pretenders are isolated
(or killed). Still it can all go wrong or right based on luck. Queen
Lann only came to power after she assassinated her younger brother - an
event beyond my control. King Putiata lived to be nearly 90 and survived
all his male sons and grandsons. His great grandson was not part of his
court and so out of player control, I just had to accept what the game
had generated. Luckily, Putiata had been preparing for his death for 30
years and the transition was smooth’ish. I wonder though what would have
happened had King Puiata lived another 4 months to see his last son born
(randy old bugger). Born after his father’s death, Eric didn’t inherit
Britannia, but did inherit Denmark from his mother.</p>

<p>War basically comes down to planning and then using overwhelming force.
It seemed that in battle the larger force won approximately 90% of the
time. Thus it was far more important to ensure you had enough money to
finish a war (sieges take a long time) and a good reason to start a war.
The later could take a long time to engineer. So it often came down to a
waiting game. In conquering England, I had to wait until they were
already involved in another war and then quickly sneak in and take a
county at a time. By the time I had a quarter of the country I worked to
destabilise the Kingdom enough to keep it in a constant state of war so
my forces could continue their slow progress. Apart from religious war
(which I never tried) conquering a decent sized opponent in this game is
a multi-generation endeavour.</p>

<p>This game has that “just one more turn” feeling. Despite its large scope
there is almost always something happening that require attention. It is
very good and very addictive - beware!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/old-dd-campaign-maps.html">posting some
maps</a>
from my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a>
campaign, I got a little nostalgic for the game. Here is a history of
that campaign in many parts (it did run for 5 years). While I would
prefer to tell the stories “in character”, my memory of the first year
or so is a little fuzzy, so this first part of the history will be
largely a statement of actions (as remembered) without too much creative
embellishment.</p>

<p>I first started playing D&amp;D in 1985, when I got the famous 1983 red box
version of the old original 1st edition basic set. With a few friends we
played a few little adventures, but it never really got any traction. It
was only in late 1987 that a permanent game emerged. We just called it
the “campaign”, although during its 5 year existence we played more than
one game. There was a single D&amp;D game that thread through the years, but
there was a significant amount of the scandalously unknown
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2300_AD">2300AD</a>, plus brief sojourns with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020">Cyberpunk 2020</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing">MERP</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_007_(role-playing_game)">James
Bond RPG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Roleplay">Warhammer
FRPG</a>. However,
we started and finished with D&amp;D.</p>

<p>The first session was held in my bedroom after school on a Friday. A
bunch of eight 12-13 year old boys. We rolled up characters, with the
special rule that each character could have one automatic 18 (the
highest possible value) in an attribute of their choice and the rest
should be rolled normally. Still most characters had two 18s - we must
have been a very lucky bunch. One of the “lucky” ones was the magic-user
Bandance, that was my character. I am also certain there was another
magic-user, Greymarel, in the party. Kur-Tas Kai, a cleric of the war
god
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dragonlance_deities#Kiri-Jolith">Kiri-Jolith</a>
(we used the Krynn dieties) might have been present, but if not was
definitely around by the second adventure. I don’t remember the rest -
most of them didn’t last long.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/B2ModuleCover.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the first few adventures we would rotate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master">Dungeon Master
(DM)</a> position among the
group. Later I took on the role permanently. I don’t know who was the
first DM, but it definitely wasn’t me. The first adventure was the
classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands">Keep on the
Borderlands</a>.
Arriving at the Keep the party was soon approached by a shadowy figure
and hired to kill the Castellan. Being adventuring neophytes, the party
neglected to demand some money upfront. The Castellan, hearing that a
group of sturdy young men from out of town had arrived, invited them to
dinner. At the dinner he suggested he had a job for the party, but got
no further. Bandance attacked and quickly killed the Castellan. The rest
of the party was shocked but regardless included in the resulting melee
with the guards. They managed to escape by starting fires in the Keep
and running into the surrounding wilderness. There the party stayed a
few days exploring the local caves before attempting a return to the
Keep in order to collect their reward. However their passage was blocked
and no reward was forthcoming. Realising they had been ripped off and
tired of trudging around the dangerous borderlands, they decided to
return home. I’m not sure this adventure went as the DM planned.</p>

<p>Next a much smaller group of players did <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgissuearticle/139/the-beacon-at-enon-tor">The Beacon at Enon
Tor</a>
adventure. I don’t remember much about this other than it was short and
involved saving a mad wizard. Nor can I remember the next small
adventure we did, Jack of Knaves (which I can’t even find on Google).</p>

<p>Next a larger group got together and played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahasia">Rahasia</a>. At this stage the group
was Greymarel, Bandance and Kur-Tas Kai plus the dwarf Kleeton, the
fighter Hugle, the thief Aeflebad and the elf Celembor (this is in notes
taken at the time). The party was hired to save an elven princess from
an evil temple. Payment this time was whatever treasure we found on the
way. As we played it, there wasn’t a great deal of combat in this
adventure. For the first (and probably last) time the party even managed
to talk its way out of a fight. The most dangerous encounter was between
members of the party itself. After the princess was saved, a fight broke
out over how to split the treasure. Bandance was on the losing side. My
notes for this adventure state “saved princess, befriended intelligent
snake, almost got lynched by party over magic items and now holds
grudge”.</p>

<p>The straight up goblin-bashing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_on_the_Hill">The Horror on the
Hill</a> was next. This
was quickly followed by the equally badly named and similar orc-bashing
of Death Dungeon. Neither of these were particularly notable and both
mainly involved constant fighting with a little exploring thrown in. I’m
certain I DM’ed these two (especially since I wrote Death Dungeon and it
wouldn’t be fair that I play it too). At this point the party added
Talin (a ranger) and a little later Ugarit (a fighter and not the right
name, but neither I nor the person playing him can remember what he was
called), but lost a couple of the others. So the group was Greymarel,
Bandance, Kur-Tas Kai, Celembor, Ugarit and Talin. However, the person
playing Celembor left somewhere around here after having personal
differences with a few other players. I remember it centered on how to
have fun in roleplaying games. Celembor said he played in a way to have
fun without caring about the other players, while the rest of the party
said it was about having fun as a group. I think this counter-argument
was lead by the person playing Kur-Tas Kai, who was becoming de facto
party spokesman. Celembor was increasingly disruptive and ostracized by
the rest of the party until he left. At this stage we started playing a
hybrid of D&amp;D with AD&amp;D and some homebrew rules. The result was combat
was quicker (with critical hits and misses) and spell-casters more
powerful.</p>

<p>The last adventure of the campaign’s early stage was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dread">Isle of
Dread</a>. Again my memory
is hazy on this and I have no notes to fall back on. The party sailed
across the ocean and investigated a semi-tropical island, killing locals
until we got tired and sailed home. By the end the campaign had been
running over a year and all the characters were level 5. This was also
the last adventure not DM’ed by me. It was also the last standalone
adventure. After this the adventures merged into one another as a
continuous story, albeit one that was largely made-up as we went along.</p>

and on its blog, <a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com">The History of
Rome</a></p>

<p>This podcast series by Mike Duncan aims to tell the complete history of
Rome from founding through the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Republic</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_empire">Empire</a> to its fall. There
are 189 episodes for a total of 74 hours (each episode being around 20
minutes in length). The podcasts are audio only and have high production
values (the first few are a little more raw, but still fine).</p>

<p>I am breaking one of my rules and reviewing this series before having
completely finished it. I am only a quarter of the way through. This
means I’m listened to 59 episodes totalling 17 hours and have only just
reached the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium">Battle of
Actium</a> in 31 BC marking
the end of the Republic. This is a huge and comprehensive history of
Rome. It covers in detail the events that other series tend to skim
over. Other histories I have consumed tend to start in the late
Republic, and don’t really get going until reaching
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a>. Here, the 400 year
period of the Kingdom, early, and middle Republic (ending with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi">Gracchi</a>) is covered over 36
episodes and 10 hours. Roman history is presented in chronological order
and in detail. The various early political manoeuvrings around Patrician
versus Plebeian laws, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnite_Wars">Samnite
wars</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_War">Latin
war</a> are all covered along with
much more. Looking at the episode list, I can only assume this fine
coverage continues all the way to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">fall of the Western Roman
Empire</a>
in 476 AD.</p>

<p>Mike is a great speaker and the information is presented in an
interesting manner. Often he will say a story is probably apocryphal,
but then give the detail anyway. Very entertaining. This series is
highly recommended.</p>

    <p>As part of preparing for moving to Malaysia many items are being dragged
out of storage and assessed - keep or discard? I recently went through
my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> stuff,
some to be sold, but most to be kept. Also, I scanned all my old notes.
There are some embarrassingly bad drawings and maps in there, but here
are the better ones. They were all drawn in 1988 or 1989, when I was in
my early teens.</p>

<p>These are the maps for a small adventure called The Inverted Tower. A
mage was terrorizing some islands from his underground lair. The players
had to stop him. Power crazed wizards were a recurring theme in our
campaign.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/rpg/Inverted_Tower.pdf"><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/IT_Preview.png" alt="Inverted Tower" /></a></p>

<p>This is the small town of Highdell. In our campaign it was the last
population centre before the wild borderlands north of the players
hometown (although there was still the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands">Keep on the
Borderlands</a> a
little further out).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/rpg/Highdell.pdf"><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/Highdell_Preview.png" alt="Highdell" /></a></p>

<p>This is a castle layout. I don’t remember it being in the game - but we
visited castles regularly, so it was probably used as a “generic” castle
a few times. I used to enjoy designing castles, but rarely completed
drawing them - this is one of two I have left (and definitely the better
one).</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>In Unity3D how can it be determined if a point is on the line segment
joining two other points? My current project throws up just such
geometry problems regularly. The problem as expressed above is a
question of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity">collinearity</a>,
that is whether some points form a line. The first step uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross
product</a>. If you have the
points A, B, C then if the cross product of the line AB and the line AC
is 0, AB and AC must be parallel. Furthermore, since both lines include
the point A, all the points must in fact be collinear. Luckily, there is
a cross product function built into the Unity3D library,
<a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.Cross.html">Vector3.Cross</a>.</p>

<p>Next, just because A, B, C are collinear does not mean C is in between A
and B. To determine this, check that C is inside the 3D volume with A &amp;
B as diametrically opposed corners. That is just check that C’s x-axis
value is inbetween A’s &amp; C’s and the same for its y-axis and z-axis
values. The function below combines these tests. Note the range checks
are performed first. This is because I imagine that the cross product is
more computationally expensive (but I have no evidence for this) so
should occur only if the faster calls succeed.</p>
