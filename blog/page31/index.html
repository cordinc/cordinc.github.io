  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I had a very short debate with an old friend. We used to debate
economics and politics in high school, despite being at different
schools. Most of these debates took place on the walk from my place to
the nearest TimeZone (an 80’s gaming arcade). The chats were always
friendly, but we rarely agreed. Over 20 years later we met up again, and
our views have shifted somewhat, but we still don’t agree. He emailed me
a long treatise from the web about his point of view. I sent back a
critique. I thought, even hoped, that might be the end of it as I lacked
time to continue a long debate. I needn’t have worried his reply was a
statement of disagreement and some valid points. I replied agreeing we
disagreed on the basic axiomatic points of the argument and largely left
it at that.</p>

<p><a href="http://xkcd.com/386/"><img src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png" alt="Someone is wrong" title="Someone is wrong" /></a></p>

<p>If a longer reply arrived attempting initiate a full debate I had
planned a slightly different response, basically apologising but
refusing to engage. Not because the debate would be uninteresting. Quite
the opposite - this friend’s viewpoint is quite dissimilar from mine and
not something I come across normally. Not because the argument would
become uncivil. Our conversations never got heated before, I don’t see
why they would this time. It is because I don’t have the mental energy
for a proper discussion.</p>

<p>I don’t think I’m as mentally fast as I used to be. Or perhaps I’m more
realistic about my learning abilities. Previously I seemed able to pick
up new skills, technology or understand systems in a matter of days
without effort and while doing several other things at the same time. Or
at least I believed I could, maybe I was just arrogant. Now, if
attempted under similar conditions, mastering something new takes a
little longer and requires more attention.</p>

<p>However, I do not think my productivity has slipped (yet). As my natural
mental speed slowed it has been compensated by an increase in experience
and focus. I have seen studies suggesting one’s mental faculties are at
their peak in the early 20’s and it is all downhill from there. My peak
productivity was in my early 30’s, and it hasn’t declined much since
then. The difference is that I’m aware of having to concentrate on the
task at hand more intensely and that my memory of previous similar work
situations helps me avoid wrong paths. Or, perhaps I’m still arrogant.</p>

<p>Right now, Concealed Intent is taking up nearly all of my thoughts. I
need all the focus and concentration (and experience) I can muster to
complete it in a reasonable timeframe. Just the initial reply to my
friend’s website took over a work day. Time I can’t afford at the moment - I’m not able to easily split my attention. So I won’t. Debates will
have to wait.</p>

  <h4><a href="/blog/2014/10/bank-transfers.html">Bank Transfer Errors</a></h4>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>At least in the UK, it is often best to pay money to people via bank
transfer. This is the process where the payer enters the bank account
number of the payee into some system and then the money is moved
directly from bank account to bank account. It is easy and costs nothing
(in the UK). I used to use it all the time for paying rent and similar
bills.</p>

<p>It is surprising to hear that errors regularly occur in this process.
People type in an incorrect bank account number and so the wrong person
receives the money. Obviously in some distress, the payer contacts the
bank to fix the problem, but the bank doesn’t see it as their problem.
Pushing or getting the media involved often gets the required results
(see
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/30/online-cash-transfer-error">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/mar/18/banks-slow-transferred-cash-wrong-account">here</a>,
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/feb/09/26000-banking-error">here</a>
and many more online stories).</p>

<p>I’m not surprised people type the account number incorrectly; that is
always going to happen. I’m surprised that such an error results in a
valid bank account. If the bank account number included a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checksum">checksum</a>, then an incorrectly
transcribed number is unlikely to still be valid. Credit cards use a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm">checksum algorithm</a> and
this is why when you type one incorrectly the response is “invalid card
number” rather than the wrong account being charged. However, bank
account numbers seem to rarely use this simple error-checking technology
(codes by country are <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E18727_01/doc.121/e13483/T359831T498954.htm">listed
here</a>).
Why not? Perhaps when the bank account system was established many
decades ago, checksums were not seem as important. Either because there
was a person (the local bank manager) in the loop to double check the
numbers, or because checksums were too computationally costly
(especially if humans had to do the calculation themselves as computers
weren’t available). Of course now people use the Internet to make
transfers and the whole process is performed by computers without human
interference, and the cost of using checksums is miniscule on even
relatively old processors.</p>

<p>Banks could add checksums now, placing an optional extra character to
the end of bank account numbers (several countries have done this). In
the UK this would be a huge act of customer service. However, from
experience I would doubt the banks interest in serving their customers.
At the moment any errors cost the banks little and changing the system
would be expensive. The core computer programs handling bank accounts
and transfers between them are ancient COBOL programs (at least at the
bank where I worked). Rules like the number of digits in a bank account
are hardcoded and changing them would cascade through various systems.
Testing the change would be a massive task in itself. I can’t imagine
any bank voluntarily undertaking such a project - especially as most
banks are determined to reduced IT costs. Too bad for bank customers.</p>

    <p>After leaving <a href="/blog/2013/06/beacon-technology-part-1.html">Beacon</a> and
finishing the MBA, I jumped on a flight to London in mid 2002. Perth was
too constraining, I didn’t want to do consulting or mining software for
the rest of my career. London seemed like the land of work opportunity.
It would also be easier to travel around the world from a base in
Europe. Both these reasons turned out to be correct, but I forgot the
downsides of London - the expense, the crowds and strangely even the
weather. For a good five years or so the positives outweighed the
negatives, but then the balance shifted. However, upon arrival I was
extremely optimistic.</p>

<p>Crashing in the spare rooms and sofas of old uni friends (the Perth to
London road was well travelled by my age cohort), I started to learn
about the local IT job market. 2002 was the middle of the dot crash
slump. Stories of easy jobs with large pay rates and regular job hopping
abounded, but they always ended with “of course that was before the
crash.” Most of my acquaintances said that contract work was the way to
go - better pay and less bureaucracy, at the expense of career
progression (none of my friends planned to stay long, so that was not an
issue). I aimed for the same, but in the downturn a person with no
record in London couldn’t get through the door for contracting roles - I
was too much of an unknown considering the large number of people
looking for work. After a few months I switched to permanent roles and
started getting interviews again. Lastminute was a notable interview
because the interviewer was so offensive I pledged to never use their
service - a promise I hold to this day, despite being right in their
target market. After 4 months my funds were evaporating quickly and if I
didn’t get one of the two jobs for which I was interviewing then a
return to Perth would be required. <a href="http://www.rbs.co.uk/">RBS</a> was my
preferred option (and I even delayed the other possibility while waiting
for them to decide). However, RBS decided I was “too cold” for a
management position (at least they gave a reason), so I went to work at
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRS_for_Music">MCPS-PRS Alliance</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The previous astronomy MOOC I completed, <a href="/blog/2014/06/anu-astro1x.html">ANU-ASTRO1x Greatest Unsolved
Mysteries of the Universe</a>, was merely
the first of a series. In total, the 4 courses in the series supposedly
comprise the first year course in astronomy at the <a href="http://www.anu.edu.au/">Australian National
University</a>. I just completed the second course
of the series, <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/anux/anux-anu-astro2x-exoplanets-1443">ANU-ASTRO2x
Exoplanets</a>.</p>

<p>Exoplanets is a 9-week course on the science behind detecting planets
beyond our solar system. The format is the same as the previous course,
with about an hour per week of video lectures. There are also mini-tests
and a homework assignment each week with a final exam. The exam is again
based on a “mystery” universe, so prior knowledge of exoplanets (or
wikipedia) won’t help - students just have to do the maths themselves.
The lectures are almost a conversational back-and-forth between the
presenters <a href="http://www.mso.anu.edu.au/pfrancis/">Paul Francis</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Schmidt">Brian Schmidt</a> (with
pictures and notes appearing projected behind them).</p>

<p>As for difficulty, this course is easy. Easier than the previous ANU
course. Basic algebra is all the maths ability required. No assignment
took me more than 30 minutes, most took much less. I read an
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/09/11/the-mooc-revolution-that-wasnt/">article</a>
suggesting that the “MOOC revolution” is failing for many reasons, one
of which is that the courses are getting easier and certainly are no
where near as testing as the original university courses. I can’t help
but think that must be true for this course. The material is
interesting, but I would find it hard to believe that first year science
students at a respected university like ANU (one of the top tier
universities in Australia) are gifted with such an easy course where a
mark of 100% can be obtained with barely an hour of work each week.</p>

<p>Starting with the first exoplanet discovered, surprisingly around a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulsar_planet">pulsar</a>, the course goes
through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_detecting_exoplanets">methods used to find
exoplanets</a>.
The pulsar planet was found through reflex motion - a wiggle in a star’s
movement caused by a planet’s mass. Most exoplanets have been found
through transits, that is the periodic dimming of a star as a planet
passes between it and us. It is also possible to find exoplanets with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_microlensing">gravitational
micro-lensing</a>,
which is when a planet passes in front of a star and focuses its light
on us. This method is has the benefit of finding planets that are not
orbiting stars but are instead free floating. The downside is that such
planets can only be observed once (as they pass the star). Still, the
number of discovered micro-lensing events suggests there are a large
number of such free-floating planets in existence. Lastly it is becoming
possible to directly observe exoplanets with modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_optics">adaptive
optics</a> technology applied
to telescopes. The course also addresses what is known about the
exoplanets discovered - calculating their mass, temperature and thus the
composition of both their atmosphere and surface.</p>

<p>An easy and interesting discussion of the current state of detecting
exoplanets. However, the field of exoplanet detection is very active and
fast moving. I’m not sure how quickly this course will age.</p>

    <p>When I grew up in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth">Perth</a> the
supermarkets always had good and relatively cheap food available.
However, I remember the local restaurants seemed to lack effort as far
as the menu was concerned (good service was never an issue). It was as
though they just relied on the high quality ingredients to carry them.
Coming back to town after 13 years abroad, I think that situation has
changed. We ate excellent meals everywhere we went, and the range of
styles available was impressive. Perth is becoming a world city, at
least as far as cuisine is concerned. It was also nice that all but two
of the restaurants we visited (over a fortnight) had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_fresco_dining">Al
fresco</a> sections -
unfortunately the weather was a bit damp for us to take proper advantage
of them. I also noted with interest that most restaurants listed the
providence of their ingredients and that the vast majority of these
originated inside West Australia itself - overseas elements were notable
in their rarity.</p>

<p>While in Perth, two restaurants in stood out as being of a particularly
high quality.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.lot20.co">Lot 20</a> is almost hidden in a building on the edge
of the cultural district near James St in Northbridge. The decor is
modern gastropub. The service was very friendly without being too much.
When asking about <a href="http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/12471/soninlaw-eggs">son-in-law
eggs</a>, the reply
not only included the recipe, but also their cultural significance (a
Thai dish made as warning to behave to a new son-in-law). After ordering
the eggs, asparagus, cauliflower and a chicken dish, we got to watch
them being prepared in the open kitchen which our table overlooked. All
the food was excellent and perfectly cooked. The chicken deserves
special mention. At first I thought it had been undercooked, but an
exploratory taste showed I was completely wrong. It had been cooked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sous-vide">in
a water bath</a> to keep it moist
and tender - incredible. We also drank some excellent local beers. I
used to say that beer, chocolate and TV were all clearly better in
London. Now I will have say that the beer (and perhaps chocolate) are
about the same - TV in Britain is still better though.</p>

<p>When I lived in Perth, Steve’s on the river in Nedlands was a large
student pub (<a href="http://www.uwa.edu.au">UWA</a> is nearby). Since then the pub
has been demolished and turned into fancy apartments. However, there is
still a restaurant and wine shop at the site, still called
<a href="http://www.steves.com.au">Steve’s</a>. Wine is a large focus of the
restaurant and there is a dedicated sommelier as well as a large
selection of local wines. The cuisine is vaguely French inspired. For an
entree I had a chorizo soup - a spicy meaty mix, well balanced and not
oily. Then the pork cassoulet with a side salad for mains. Beautifully
cooked, it quickly filled my stomach, but I kept eating until finished -
it was too good to leave anything behind. The wine was also very good,
but I don’t remember what we ordered.</p>
