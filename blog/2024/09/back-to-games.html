<p>It has been too long. I’ve been playing the occasional game since the last set of reviews. Now there is enough for a blog post…</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075740/Banners_of_Ruin/">Banners Of Ruin</a></strong> (13 hrs) - A deckbuilder set in a medieval world where all the characters are animals. It has all the usual mechanics you would expect: lots of unlocks; combo cards; a choice of events; non-combat events; etc. The novelty is from the ability to have upto six characters fighting on your side. Thus positioning becomes important, as does drawing enough cards to feed all those characters. The downside is it can become hard to remember which cards can be played by which characters (I made so many sequencing errors). Everything about this game is well-made and competently implemented. However, it just didn’t grab me. Competent, non-flashy - a good but not great game.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993790/Ancient_Enemy/">Ancient Enemy</a></strong> (3hrs) - solitaire-like card set in a magical dark ages Wales. By the same people as <a href="/blog/2022/04/enough-gaming.html">Regency Solitaire</a>, it is so similar it could be a sequel except for the change in setting. The other new addition is occasional battles where your powers increase as you clear more cards and you can see what the enemy will do next. These battles make it too hectic for the relaxed experience of Regency Solitaire, but the battles are not exciting enough to make me play this, instead of Slay The Spire. An interesting attempt to merge two different genres, but not interesting enough to keep me playing.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands/">Stacklands</a></strong> (20hrs) - Its a deckbuilder, no a city builder, no a survival game. Clever little cross-genre game. Collect card packs to get cards and place them together to create new cards to build a village and keep the villagers alive in the face of starvation and constant attacks. Lots of achievements and goals kept me going past the usual 10 hour limit for builder games. However, eventually it succumbed to the standard busywork problem and so I stopped not far from 100%.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://playruneterra.com/">Legends of Runeterra</a></strong> (too many hours) - <a href="/blog/2022/10/back-again-gaming.html">See initial thoughts here</a>. Played some more of this and even ranked online for a bit. My conclusion is it is a bad game. It is out of my system now. This game has that collect-them-all addictive (or compulsive) drive to collect all the cards. Luckily it is F2P and is very generous with in game rewards (I got to 70% of all cards without spending anything). However the multiplayer version of the game is high variance. There are many high value cards that can easily swing a game. It just depends who draws their good cards first. Thus even the best decks have around a 55% win rate. So many times the RNG is going to mean you are wasting your time from the start - you or your opponent is just too unlucky to make for a good game. It turns into a bit of a grind - like poker, but without the excitement/stress of playing for money. I suspect this is a conscious decision by the developers, I suspect it helps with monetisation. Not a good use of time. Just toss a (slightly weighted) coin instead, it is just as much fun and much quicker.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385100/Insurmountable/">Insurmountable</a></strong> (14 hours) - Climb mountains fighting the elements and a spooky time-loop story events in this kinda 3D roguelike. The climbing itself is ok, but the events on the mountain are fairly limited and repeat often. I understand this might be intentional given the timeloop, but still makes the game tedious. Once I got the same event 3 times on a single climb (no looping in sight). A good idea that just doesn’t translate well into a game (in this case at least). Skippable.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461840/Zenge/">Zenge</a></strong> (30 minutes) - Casual puzzle game of moving shapes along tracks until a picture is revealed telling a story. I got through a third of the game in 30 minutes, stopped, and haven’t felt the need to go back.</p>
