<h4>Media Bias</h4>

<p>I often hear a complaint that the news from newspaper X or channel Y is biased. Yes of course, but does it matter? Often the same person will follow up with, “so I get my news from outlet Z”, which is some other obviously biased news source. Probably all news media is biased, I imagine it would be near impossible to be unbiased. If you find yourself agreeing with a source all the time, most likely their bias matches yours, not that they are especially accurate.</p>

<p>So if they are all biased, should you just abandon all of them? No, I don’t think that is necessary.</p>

<p>I liken handling bias in news to managing process improvement. It is not about being perfect every time, but about being able to adjust for errors. For example in aiming, you might not expect to hit the center of the target, but there is a process for adjusting technique for improving accuracy. For news or the media, I find equivalent techniques apply.</p>

<p>Imagine you are shooting for the dead center of a target. You miss, people always miss. In the Olympics people don’t get perfect scores in the shooting or archery. The distance and direction to the center is the error (and in this metaphor also the bias). If your attempts are always a little to the left that’s good, you just aim a bit to the right and you should be closer to the result. You want your shots to be in a tight cluster, then adjust your aim so the cluster is where you want it. The same with news.</p>

<p>To that end, you need 3 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The bias to be known - if you are reading about an event you know nothing about in an unfamiliar source, unless the bias is obvious in the text (see point 2) it will be hard to work out what is really going on. Sadly this is very common and you just need to be dubious. In the aiming metaphor, you need to be able to see where your attempt lands. If you never look at the result, then you won’t know how to adjust.</li>
  <li>The bias to not be too extreme - This is often seen in more ideological publications, the result can be intentially misleading and thus very had to adjust for. This publications should just be avoided. While very common it is usually easy to spot. This is like if your shot misses by so much it doesn’t even reach the target.  All UK tabloids I’ve ever read fail on this test.</li>
  <li>The bias to be constant - If the bias keeps changing, your previous adjustments may make things worse. The tighter they are clustered the easier to adjust. If one if off to the left and the next if off to the right, what do you do? News companies controlled by one person exerting some editorial control will often exhibit this, the bias changing to whatever is convienent at the time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Something to avoid are all opinion/editorial pieces. These are mostly written specificially to influence by people not experts on the topic at hand (like this blog post :). Also most culture sections are not that great, same with sports, but neither matter much to me. Definitely keep clear of anything owned and led by billionaires. In my experience they tend to espouse their owner’s interests, which change quickly and easily (so fail #3). I remember one paper decades ago that was fiercely pro-China when the owner had business interests there, but switched hard to anti-China views when those investments failed.</p>

<p>So what do I read? I find the new sections of the specialist finanical media good (FT, AFR, Economist, Reuters, Bloomberg). Because they are unbiased? Absolutely not, they are very biased. However, when it comes to news events they pass the 3 tests above. The bias is obvious: companies, free market, being rich and capitalism are good, anything working against those things is bad. That bias not secretive either. I remember the Economist (back when I read it regularly 20 years ago) explicitly stating their neoliberal bias as an aside every few issues. Nor is it generally extreme as they have an unspoken interest in being roughly accurate. The implicit assumption is that people will make investment decisions based on the news in these outlets, so expect them to be mostly correct, and if not they would lose reputation (a self-declared Marxist first made this argument to me).</p>

<p>I have lived in a few countries and found the government media generally pass the 3 tests too. For instance, I watched the BBC in the UK and SBS in Australia. Both biased, but being inside the country at the time, I was quite aware of the size and direction of that bias. If you are not in country it would be much harder to tell. I can easily imagine that the government media in some countries may fail point #2 if they are more propagandistic and less free. I also used to read the Guardian when in the UK, being well aware of its biases, as they had been the same for decades (a sort of polite, socially acceptable left-leaning).</p>
