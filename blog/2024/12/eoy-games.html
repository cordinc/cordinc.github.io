<p>Some more games I played over the last 6 months of 2024.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/758370/Through_the_Ages/">Through The Ages</a></strong> (9 hrs) - A computer version of the well regarded card-based, civilisation building boardgame <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182028/through-the-ages-a-new-story-of-civilization">of the same name</a>. Graphics are simple, presumably to match the tabletop’s physical cards. The game is reasonably complex, and it’s good to have the computer do the calculations for you. Not much else to say. It seems like a competent conversion, but I doubt people will want it unless they already have an interest in the original version.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/510420/The_Hex/">The Hex</a></strong> (1 hr) - A mashup of many genres in service of a story game with many secrets. Hard to define, it is by the same person as Pony Island (which I didn’t like) and <a href="/blog/2022/04/enough-gaming.html">Inscryption</a> (which I loved) - so if you know either of them, this is similar. It falls between those games both chronologically and in my appreciation. However, the genres and tropes it was playing with don’t interest me much, so I bounced off it hard. My advice, start with Inscryption and if you like that, move backwards through the others.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162700/Midnight_Protocol/">Midnight Protocol</a></strong> (3 hrs) - Hacking game. Move around computer networks, run programs to break defences and steal. I’ve played a few of these and find them quite similar. This is a well made, but standard version. The marketing materials tout the keyboard only controls, but I fail to see why that is a notable feature. Good game, but felt too familiar to grab my interest.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">Vampire Survivors</a></strong> (30 hrs) - A novel bullet-hell game, where the player is the bullet hell. The player doesn’t need to shoot, your weapons automatically shoot for you on a set schedule/pattern - just like the enemies in a normal bullet hell. Start underpowered, running away from the enemies, and soon find yourself over-powered, blasting projectiles in a satisfying cacophony of shapes, colour and sound. In later stages the biggest difficulty is understanding what is happening on a very busy screen! But not to worry, because games all finish after at most 30 minutes, then its time to start over. A simple game with plain graphics and sound, but the gameplay is so well designed it becomes extremely addictive. I do not normally like this sort of game, but this is a big exception. A great game!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/">Disco Elysium</a></strong> (2 hrs) - I really wanted to like this chatty isometric RPG with tabletop (ie dice rolling) mechanics. It is set in a strange, but vaguely 70’s world, where you are investigating a murder, while various parts of your mind converse with you. Strange, but slow. I made a bad choice and the game ended abruptly after 30 minutes, so I needed to start again. Then it crashed on me after an hour (and wiped my saves). I didn’t have the motivation to restart and go over the same thing a third time. Showed potential, but not enough to hook me.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1434540/Zoeti/">Zoeti</a></strong> (6 hours) - Fantasy cutesy anime semi-deckbuilder battler where the player collects cards for actions and then draws from a normal deck of cards and uses that to power the actions. It also has a narrative story (although not one I found particularly interesting). An interesting idea for variation on the Slay The Spire system, but is otherwise extremely similar, and not as good (of course Slay The Spire is exceptional!). This feels like a mobile conversion, and some of the UI is clunky as a result. It is an ok game.</p>
