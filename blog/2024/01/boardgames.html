<p>I continued tracking the boardgames I played through 2023 (<a href="/blog/2023/02/boardgames.html">see the 2022 list</a>). Last year I played 21 different games a total of 47 times. The increase was largely due to joining a couple of clubs: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/guild/view/4251">Strategy Boardgamers WA</a> is a reborn version of the Perth Long Boardgames club that shutdown during the Covid lockdowns; The Salvage League (no website) is devoted to playing quick games of Battletech: Alpha Strike. I had a goal of finishing the year having played all my previous unplayed games (they are marked in bold). I missed one, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163154/falling-sky-gallic-revolt-against-caesar">Falling Sky</a>, but it is on the schedule to be played at SBWA in a few months (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>Games listed in <em>italics</em> are games I do not own, while those in <strong>bold</strong> are my games that I played for the first time in 2023. Very long games split over multiple days are counted in distinct play sessions (of at least 2 hours).</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts on any game I played more than once, and haven’t previously reviewed (consider my plays of 7 Wonders Duel &amp; Sprawlopolis as a sign of my continued enjoyment):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Battletech</strong>: Large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha">mecha</a> battling other large mecha in a 31st century beset by war. This miniatures wargame came out 40 years ago and has been moderately popular ever since. I like it, and have played a lot of the faster paced, larger scale Alpha Strike version, but the more detailed, slower classic version is good too.</li>
  <li><strong>Wingspan</strong>: Cute tableau builder about collecting birds for a sanctuary. Beautiful art and strangely popular with people who don’t play many boardgames. Enjoyable but I’m not  good player as a there is enough randomness that plans go astray quickly. Maybe that is why people like playing against me.</li>
  <li><strong>Villagers</strong>: Fast tableau builder about building up a medieval village by tempting increasingly skilled and thus valuable workpeople to move in.</li>
  <li><strong>High Frontier</strong>: Complicated simulation of spaceship travel and construction through the solar system. Designed by an ex-NASA engineer with known physics (no faster-than-light stuff here). Requires commitment, concentration, patience and several hours to play. Finishing a game successfully gives a sense of satisfaction, like an exhausting workout. Very hard to get other people interested in trying it, a certain mindset is required :)</li>
  <li><strong>7th Continent</strong>: A long card-based cooperative narrative adventure game that is like a cross between a choose-your-own-adventure and a boardgame. Very long - my first game was 5 hours and the second 6, both were losses. Interesting, but it seems very puzzle based, so the more you play, the more you recognise situations and the easier it becomes. I feel this may not be a keeper and after a few more games it will be time to move it on.</li>
  <li><strong>Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonics</strong>: A cross between a boardgame and a miniatures game, here you move blocks denoting various units around a board to recreate various Napoleonic battles. The hook is that you can’t just move and fight at will. To model the problems of historical command, each player must play cards that dictate which units may act. Frustrating, but in a good way, and fast playing, so it doesn’t feel unfair.</li>
