<h4>Intelligence?</h4>

<p>There appears to a common view on various corners of the Internet that current AI is crap, borderline unusable. A subset of those people suggest it will never be “good enough”. This is largely due to the mistakes made by the public-facing generative large language models (LLMs) that Google, Microsoft and other are determined to push on their users. They make lots of maths errors, they can’t count the number of r’s in strawberry, they just make stuff up.</p>

<p>I agree with some of this. Current AI tools are often not being used appropriately, considering a knowledge of their deficiencies and this can create a negative impression of the whole technology. Certainly LLM tools have been put into search engines to soon in my opinion. They need to make less mistakes before they provide an experience equivalent to what we had before. Similarly, why would a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65735769">lawyer use an LLM</a> without checking for hallucinations?</p>

<p>I also disagree with parts too. To me it seems partly a misunderstanding of what counts as intelligence and thus regularly moving the goalposts of a true AI definition.</p>

<p>I haven’t heard anyone suggest, as of today, we have a true artificial intelligence (some people refer to this as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>). Instead there are various tools that we call AI for marketing purposes. However, in reaching this point I have seen many definitions of computer intelligence come and go.</p>

<p>When just starting out in computing, some (non-technical) people would tell me computers couldn’t be intelligent until they could beat humans at Chess or Go. Well those lines were passed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov">1997</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol">2016</a> respectively, but no one considers those systems intelligent in the human sense. There have been goals around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a>, but current systems regularly pass these tests (note that the versions you see online are usually trained to not appear too human!). Other suggestions are that the creation of various forms of art are the mark of intelligence, but modern systems can do that.</p>

<p>Is it good art? I don’t know. I do know AI tools create better pictures and music than I could. I don’t even know how to play Go. My maths skills are better than average, but I still make mistakes all the time. I have been known to speak nonsense and make stuff up. Does that mean I’m not intelligent? If we held humans to the same standards as AI tools, I’m not sure many people would qualify as intelligent. Imagine the dumbest human you know capable of getting by in society. I would definitely consider that person intelligent in the computational sense. In some specific areas computers can surpass that person’s capacities, but in the general case they can’t.</p>

<p>Over the last 32 years that I have been paying attention to the state of the art in AI, the progress overall has been astounding, especially over the last ten. Modern AIs may not meet all your specific expectations, but they are improving fast enough I wouldn’t be confident that situation will remain for long. Will that mean we have a true AGI? I doubt it (but without certainty) as I’m not certain what intelligence is other “I’ll know it when I see it.” It is far more likely to me people will redefine what AGI is (again) and then claim they have reached their goal or haven’t depending on their existing bias.</p>
