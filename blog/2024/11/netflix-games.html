<p>Did you know Neflix has games? I have been a subscriber for years and never played one of their games. Since I am likely to leave their site soon (for a little while at least), I thought I should try a few games before I go. All the below were played on an iPad and the time played is a guess as Netflix won’t tell me.</p>

<p><strong>Immortality</strong> (about 6-8 hours?) - I was keen to play this after greatly enjoying <a href="/blog/2015/07/her-story.html">Her Story</a>, a previous game by the same team. The player goes through the scenes of 3 films out of order to discover their mysteries. Scrub back and forth through scenes and access newly available scenes by selecting objects common to both. The problem is I didn’t know what the mystery was. I just aimlessly went through scenes. Even though a larger story did start to emerge, I never really lost that confused directionlessness. Perhaps as a result, I felt a lot more passive in this game than Her Story. I just lost interest, thinking I was a long way from the end, but reading the plot in online spoilers I had actually discovered most of the story. Interesting and well made, but too clever for its own good.</p>

<p><strong>Game Dev Tycoon</strong> (about 6-8 hours?) - Instead of actual game dev perhaps I could just play a game about game dev? This is a fairly simple and unchallenging simulation game, almost casual. You choose the genre/topic/platform of your next game and it gets reviewed and sells based on how much effort is put into various areas. Then repeat until you go broke or finish the game. If you play games semi-regularly then the appropriate actions are unsurprising, On my one and only game I got nowhere near bankruptcy. It has an indie charm, but I staring losing interest quickly, only continuing to the end to see if something changed or happened (it didn’t).</p>

<p><strong>Spiritfarer</strong> (90 minutes?) - Cosy basebuilder game where the player replaces Charon in ferrying the dead to the underworld. Only instead of a small rowboat, you have a large ship with various upgrades available (including a garden). In my time playing I didn’t ferry a single soul, instead spent my time collecting resources and talking with the local residents between life and death. Very slow and chatty, plus the controls on my iPad were awkward, so it quickly lost my attention. Not my sort of game.</p>

<p><strong>Monument Valley</strong> (1 hour?) - Good looking puzzle game. Not my thing.</p>

<p><strong>Moonlighter</strong> (4-5 hours?) - Pixel graphics, realtime roguelike where after each short run in the dungeon you take the loot back to your store and sell it for money. Or, use it to craft better equipment, but I sold most of it. You can also upgrade your home town and your store - a nice touch. Not too taxing, being defeated just delays you and it’s always possible to escape at a small cost. I found the iPad controls a bit annoying for a realtime game, the targets on the screen were too small when trying to touch them with my fat fingers. A good, almost cosy roguelike (I didn’t know that was even possible!), but started to feel repetitive.</p>

<p><strong>Exploding Kittens</strong> (1 hour?) - Card game translated directly from the popular <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172225/exploding-kittens">tabletop version</a> (which I had not played previously). Has an evil (?) cat theme, trying to be funny. High variance, but very short and quick to replay so that is not a problem - I think the idea is you play multiple times in a session. When playing alone against the AI this was mildly entertaining, but I imagine it shines when played as a group party game.</p>

<p><strong>Terra Nil</strong> (3-4 hours) - A anti-city builder. It plays like a city builder (place and connect buildings on a map grid), but the task is to clean up a polluted site and leave it pristine after tearing down all the buildings previously built. Excellent idea, and its full of nice touches like the animals moving back in (and their happiness level according to the current environment). Again, I would describe this as cosy, is this a theme with Netflix games? Nice game.</p>
