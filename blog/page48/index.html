  <div class="content">
    <p>I have been programming mainly in <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> over
the last fortnight, and thought it time to write some unit tests for my
work. I found reference to a <a href="http://unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=Category:Unit_Test_Framework">few testing frameworks
online</a>.
The most promising appeared to be
<a href="http://www.unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=SharpUnit">SharpUnit</a>,
and it is also released under a fairly relaxed license. However, I had
to make a few changed to get it running, so this post details that work.</p>

<p>SharpUnit works like a standard unit testing framework for C# code in
Unity3D (although all output goes to the console, but that is fine for
me). Although my work has largely been in UnityScript (Unity3D’s
JavaScript like language) and this didn’t work so well due to issues
with compilation order and SharpUnit’s use of .Net custom attributes.
After making the changes below, I found SharpUnit works well, and I’ll
probably be using it for my unit testing.</p>

<p>Unity3D compiles scripts in a set order (<a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/index.Script_compilation_28Advanced29.html">as described
here</a>).
Thus if you have C# code that references a UnityScript class there can
be a problem - although the reverse is not such an issue. When testing
UnityScript with SharpUnit this means that the C# <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unity3D_TestRunner</code>
class can be an issue. It references the <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestCase</code> classes, which I
want to write in UnityScript. To do this I put the SharpUnit code in a
folder under the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Plugins</code> top-level folder (the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Standard Assets</code>
folder would have also worked). This means the SharpUnit code is
compiled first. Then my tests went in a new folder together with a
UnityScript rewrite of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Unity3D_TestRunner</code>, as shown below. This
UnityScript TestRunner script is then attached to the TestRunner
GameObject (in a special testing scene) rather than the C# version as
described in the SharpUnit instructions.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">pragma</span> <span class="nx">strict</span>

<span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">SharpUnit</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">Start</span> <span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">suite</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">TestSuite</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">TestSuite</span><span class="p">();</span>
	<span class="nx">suite</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">AddAll</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">DummyTest</span><span class="p">());</span>
	<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">TestResult</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">suite</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Run</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">);</span>
	<span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">reporter</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nx">Unity3D_TestReporter</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">Unity3D_TestReporter</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="nx">reporter</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">LogResults</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Other possible solutions to this problem would be to just write my code
in C# or to change SharpUnit to load <code class="highlighter-rouge">TestCase</code> classes dynamically at
runtime. Rewriting the TestRunner seemed easiest.</p>

<p>The other problem encountered is that SharpUnit uses the C# custom
attribute <code class="highlighter-rouge">[UnitTest]</code> to identify its test methods. The equivalent in
UnityScript is a script directive (see <a href="http://answers.unity3d.com/questions/12911/what-are-the-syntax-differences-in-c-and-javascrip.html">the relevant section
here</a>).
Thus <code class="highlighter-rouge">@UnitTest</code> needs to be placed at the top of each test function.</p>

<p>After that change I could run UnityScript tests with SharpUnit. An
example test is below:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="err">#</span><span class="nx">pragma</span> <span class="nx">strict</span>

<span class="k">import</span> <span class="nx">SharpUnit</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nx">DummyTest</span> <span class="kd">extends</span> <span class="nx">TestCase</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">dummy</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="nb">String</span><span class="p">;</span>  

    <span class="cm">/** Setup test resources, called before each test. */</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">SetUp</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">dummy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">lkjkjh</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span> 
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="cm">/** Dispose of test resources, called after each test */</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">TearDown</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">dummy</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="p">;</span> 
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="cm">/** Sample test that passes */</span>
    <span class="p">@</span><span class="nd">UnitTest</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">TestDummy_Pass</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">Assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">NotNull</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">dummy</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="cm">/** Sample test that fails. */</span>
    <span class="p">@</span><span class="nd">UnitTest</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">TestDummy_Fail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">Assert</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Null</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">dummy</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

    <p>The most oft repeated tale of my time at Rio Tinto R&amp;TD is the Rambo
course. Every year a dozen or so staff would be sent on a management
training course. Many people were eager to avoid it. Although everyone
had to do it at least once and it was advisable to go if you wanted to
be promoted (so I was keen). Most people had been multiple times. Since
our team was so small, about a third of the facility went each year.</p>

    <p>School science teachers like to emphasize that the failure of an
experiment is as useful a learning experience as its success. Of course
the high-achieving student knows that is bollocks and ensures their
experiements always succeed - if you need a straight line, only gather
two data points! Despite that I think the underlying idea is correct and
experimental failure should not be hidden.</p>

<p>A recent experiment of mine failed. I am writing a game with an online
component and wanted the same code running on both the client and server - as this would reduce the chance of bugs. For ease of development
<a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> is being used for the client end, so the
code there is either Javascript or C#. I have been writing Java servers
professionally for years so it seemed silly not to use that knowledge.
Clearly there is no common ground there. However, there is a project
called <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> to allow Javascript to run
inside the Java JVM.</p>

<p>So can Javascript from Unity run in a Java environment? The short answer
is “no”, but the longer answer is “sometimes, with many caveats”.</p>

<p>Firstly it is possible to run Javascript functions in Java. Load up the
Rhino library into the classpath and if you have Javascript code like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">square</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>then you can run it in Java with the folowing:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nc">Context</span> <span class="n">cx</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">enter</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="nc">Scriptable</span> <span class="n">scope</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">initStandardObjects</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="nc">Function</span> <span class="n">f1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">compileFunction</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">readFile</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"src/test_fn.js"</span><span class="o">),</span> <span class="s">"&lt;cmd&gt;"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">call</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">cx</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">scope</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">f1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Object</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">}));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So far so good. If your Unity Javascript is just a collection of simple
functions then this is all that is required. However, there is a good
chance this is not the case. Obviously any Unity specific functions and
classes are not available (eg Ray, Input, etc). However, more important
are the big differences between Unity Javascript and standard (ECMA)
Javascript.</p>

<p>Many people say that Javascript in Unity should more accurately be
referred to as UnityScript. I think that is definitely true. Although it
looks like Javascript there are some fundamental changes. Most
importantly, Javascript uses a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/387707/whats-the-best-way-to-define-a-class-in-javascript">prototype-based scheme to define
classes</a>.
UnityScript has an inheritance model, and <a href="http://unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=UnityScript_versus_JavaScript">the two schemes are not
compatible</a>.
To me these differences are enough to prevent want I wanted to achieve.</p>

    <p>Recently at work I was asked to find out if anyone was still using a
small tactical program I wrote. If it was unused, they apologetically
asked me to shut it down. No apology was required, but I understand why
it was offered. Some developers can become quite precious about their
code and want to see it keep running forever. However, after working in
this fast-paced industry for nearly 15 years I have long accepted that
most of my code is no longer running. I’d be lucky if most of it is even
still backed up somewhere rather than being sent to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/null">/dev/null</a>.</p>

<p>Four of my old teams were shutdown with near total loss of code. Another
two years were spent at a consulting firm where most of the clients I
serviced no longer exist. Those 5 jobs combined mean that half of my
working life’s production is largely gone. At a guess I would say 10% of
the code from my first five working years is still used; around 30% from
the second five years; and, over two-thirds of the last 5 years of my
code is currently running. My professional code appears to have a
half-life of around 4 years. This sounds about right considering the
rate of technology change.</p>
