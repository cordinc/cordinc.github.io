    <p>The most oft repeated tale of my time at Rio Tinto R&amp;TD is the Rambo
course. Every year a dozen or so staff would be sent on a management
training course. Many people were eager to avoid it. Although everyone
had to do it at least once and it was advisable to go if you wanted to
be promoted (so I was keen). Most people had been multiple times. Since
our team was so small, about a third of the facility went each year.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>School science teachers like to emphasize that the failure of an
experiment is as useful a learning experience as its success. Of course
the high-achieving student knows that is bollocks and ensures their
experiements always succeed - if you need a straight line, only gather
two data points! Despite that I think the underlying idea is correct and
experimental failure should not be hidden.</p>

<p>A recent experiment of mine failed. I am writing a game with an online
component and wanted the same code running on both the client and server - as this would reduce the chance of bugs. For ease of development
<a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> is being used for the client end, so the
code there is either Javascript or C#. I have been writing Java servers
professionally for years so it seemed silly not to use that knowledge.
Clearly there is no common ground there. However, there is a project
called <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/">Rhino</a> to allow Javascript to run
inside the Java JVM.</p>

<p>So can Javascript from Unity run in a Java environment? The short answer
is “no”, but the longer answer is “sometimes, with many caveats”.</p>

<p>Firstly it is possible to run Javascript functions in Java. Load up the
Rhino library into the classpath and if you have Javascript code like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">square</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">*</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>then you can run it in Java with the folowing:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"><span class="nc">Context</span> <span class="n">cx</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">Context</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">enter</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="nc">Scriptable</span> <span class="n">scope</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">initStandardObjects</span><span class="o">();</span>
<span class="nc">Function</span> <span class="n">f1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cx</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">compileFunction</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">scope</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">readFile</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"src/test_fn.js"</span><span class="o">),</span> <span class="s">"&lt;cmd&gt;"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="kc">null</span><span class="o">);</span>
<span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">println</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">f1</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">call</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">cx</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">scope</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">f1</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nc">Object</span><span class="o">[]</span> <span class="o">{</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="o">}));</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So far so good. If your Unity Javascript is just a collection of simple
functions then this is all that is required. However, there is a good
chance this is not the case. Obviously any Unity specific functions and
classes are not available (eg Ray, Input, etc). However, more important
are the big differences between Unity Javascript and standard (ECMA)
Javascript.</p>

<p>Many people say that Javascript in Unity should more accurately be
referred to as UnityScript. I think that is definitely true. Although it
looks like Javascript there are some fundamental changes. Most
importantly, Javascript uses a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/387707/whats-the-best-way-to-define-a-class-in-javascript">prototype-based scheme to define
classes</a>.
UnityScript has an inheritance model, and <a href="http://unifycommunity.com/wiki/index.php?title=UnityScript_versus_JavaScript">the two schemes are not
compatible</a>.
To me these differences are enough to prevent want I wanted to achieve.</p>

    <p>Recently at work I was asked to find out if anyone was still using a
small tactical program I wrote. If it was unused, they apologetically
asked me to shut it down. No apology was required, but I understand why
it was offered. Some developers can become quite precious about their
code and want to see it keep running forever. However, after working in
this fast-paced industry for nearly 15 years I have long accepted that
most of my code is no longer running. I’d be lucky if most of it is even
still backed up somewhere rather than being sent to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//dev/null">/dev/null</a>.</p>

<p>Four of my old teams were shutdown with near total loss of code. Another
two years were spent at a consulting firm where most of the clients I
serviced no longer exist. Those 5 jobs combined mean that half of my
working life’s production is largely gone. At a guess I would say 10% of
the code from my first five working years is still used; around 30% from
the second five years; and, over two-thirds of the last 5 years of my
code is currently running. My professional code appears to have a
half-life of around 4 years. This sounds about right considering the
rate of technology change.</p>

  <h4><a href="/blog/2012/03/line-plane-intersection-in-uni.html">Line / Plane Intersection in Unity3D</a></h4> 
  Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Technical.html">Technical</a>, 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Unity.html">Unity</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>In a recent <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> game prototype I needed to
determine the point of intersection between a line and plane. A player
would click on the screen where they wanted their spaceship to go, and I
needed to work out where that actually was in the world coordinates. The
line is defined by the camera point and the point on the screen clicked
(as given by <code class="highlighter-rouge">camera.ScreenToWorldPoint</code>). The plane was the spaceship
(assuming no up or down movement).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/line_plane.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>If the line was intersecting an object in the scene then this could be
easily achieved with Unity3D’s built in functions. In this case by
casting a ray from the camera and finding the objects it hits (see the
<a href="http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/Physics.Raycast.html">Raycast help
page</a>).
However, my prototype is set in space, there is no object there to hit
other than a small spaceship.</p>

<p>First, let’s work out the equation of the line from the camera (point
‘c’) and the mouse click (point ‘m’). We can get the position of the
camera with <code class="highlighter-rouge">var c = camera.transform.position</code> and the position of the
mouse click with:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">camera</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ScreenToWorldPoint</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Vector3</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">Input</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">mousePosition</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">Input</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">mousePosition</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">100.0</span><span class="p">));</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>Note that in the above, the third vector parameter (the Z value) in the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ScreenToWorldPoint</code> call is the distance from the camera of the
resulting point. Thus if 0 or <code class="highlighter-rouge">mousePosition.z</code> (which is also 0) is
used then the resulting point is just the camera location itself. Here I
have used a distance of 100 to make sure there is a good separation
between the points describing the line. The <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Point-LineDistance3-Dimensional.html">general equation of a line
in 3
dimensions</a>
is (for the points c &amp; m):</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">x</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">t</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">z</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">z</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">t</span><span class="p">]</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>So to find the point of intersection requires solving that
simultaneously with the equation of the plane. Here is where my scenario
gets easy. The plane this line intersects with in my game is the
horizontal plane the spaceship is current on. That is the plane is
described by:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">spaceship</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>At some point on the line the following holds as long as the line
intersects at some point:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="nx">spaceship</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">*</span> <span class="nx">t</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>which means:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="nx">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="c1">// no intersection</span>
<span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
   <span class="nx">t</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">spaceship</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">/</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">m</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="nx">c</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">y</span><span class="p">);</span> 
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The case <code class="highlighter-rouge">m.y == c.y</code> denotes the case where the line does not intersect
the plane. What happens here is up to you. With the value of ‘t’ known
the equation for the line can be solved to give the point of
intersection. Done.</p>
