    <p>The third day of Unite12 started quietly after the awards party the
night before. To their credit the winners of the big prize got up in
time to deliver one of the first sessions of the day (which I didn’t
attend). The crowd seemed typical to other IT related conferences or
courses - 90-95% male and averaging around 30. There also wasn’t much
swapping of business cards in general - swapping contact details
electronically seems to be far more popular now.</p>

    <p>On the second day of Unite12 I slept in and missed the first talk in
order to prepare for a long afternoon. It was a presentation by Brian
Fargo on the successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>
campaign for <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/">Wasteland</a>. A
great deal has been said about using Kickstarter for games recently, and
ConcealedIntent is unlikely to use the service soon (or at all). So I
thought this could be safely missed.</p>

    <p>Wednesday 22 August was the first day of the
<a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a> Unity conference in Amsterdam,
which I was lucky enough to attend. My first thought was Unity is larger
than I thought - the conference was packed. A couple of sessions saw
people sitting on the floor. The official attendance was 1200, over
double my expectation (although 200 of that number are Unity employees).
Also surprising, a nice lunch and breakfast was provided.</p>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago I bought a new laptop from Apple. Below is the
shipping report on how it got to me from its final manufacturer in
China. An impressive jaunt - even if it did have to spend the weekend in
Koeln.</p>

    <p>On Thursday was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women">Olympic Women’s Football
Final</a>,
which I attended.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/7753266456/in/photostream/lightbox/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8288/7753266456_4d3129b8df.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I’m not a huge Football fan, but Ann wanted to see at least one Olympic
event and this was the only one for which we could get tickets (the
Olympic online ticketing system is a mess). And not bad tickets they
were, just off to the side 21 rows back from one of the goals. We had a
clear view of everything that happened at our end. Although despite the
pitch being smaller than I had expected (maybe I’m just used to the
larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football_playing_field">AFL
pitches</a>),
my depth perception wasn’t too good when play was at the other end.</p>

<p>The game was good with lots of action. The US beat Japan 2-1. Japan
appeared by far the more aggressive team, or maybe they were more
desperate, as the US went a goal up early in the match. Certainly the US
players owe their goalie a few drinks after a series of great saves.</p>

<p>It was a good natured game and crowd (although more fouls occurred
towards the end of the match). There seemed to be more US supporters and
more US flags, but there was still a good number of Japanese supporters
and no segregation. Both “USA, USA, USA” and “Nippon, Nippon, Nippon”
chants regularly reverberated around the stadium. The crowd was huge, I
have never seem so many people in one place - 80,207 according the the
announcer. There was just a continuous flood of people heading in and
out of the stadium.</p>

<p>A surprisingly good night.</p>
