    <p>Britain has two postal systems. The main one is the well known <a href="http://www.royalmail.com">Royal
Mail</a>. The vast majority of mail goes through
this system and uses the standard UK postcode system. If you have sent
mail to or from Britain, this is almost certainly the system you have
used. The other system is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Forces_Post_Office">British Forces Post Office
(BFPO)</a>. It is
for sending post to British Forces abroad. Technically this means it
predates the Royal Mail, as the first English postal system was set up
for English soldiers in Scotland or France. The idea is that you send
mail to the BFPO address in Britain and then the government will ensure
it reaches the appropriate person around the world without handing it
over to anyone outside the British government. Normally this means the
military delivers it, but it can also go through diplomatic or foreign
office channels.</p>

<p>BFPO address look quite different to Royal Mail address. They just have
the addressee’s name, their id code and the BFPO Code. Sometimes a
postcode is appended for getting through some mail systems, <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ha4+6ep">HA4
6EP</a> - check it out. For
example BFPO 792 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bastion">Camp
Bastion</a> in Afghanistan, BFPO
305 is the navy ship
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Illustrious_(R06)">HMS
Illustrious</a> and BFPO 5439 is the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.
That last one is my new address and thus I have discovered the great
problem with BFPO addresses. Very few people seem to know how they work.
To all UK (and to a lesser extent, worldwide) web developers, there is
more than one UK post system - please handle it! In particular, pooks to
you HSBC - I expected better from an “international” bank.</p>

    <p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep">A Fire Upon The
Deep</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Fraction">The Star
Fraction</a>. Both are
science-fiction novels written in the early-mid 1990’s by authors with a
computer science background, and both share (as part of the background
context) a somewhat antiquated concern with network bandwidth. A Fire
Upon The Deep is a rollicking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera">space
opera</a> - an exciting and fast
paced adventure containing many interesting ideas. The Star Fraction is
a near future tale of a possible singularity event (largely avoided) and
wasn’t nearly as enjoyable due to a dominant preoccupation with politics
that didn’t flow nicely with the action.</p>

<p>Both novels feature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet-like</a>
communication and both fret at points about having enough bandwidth. I
think Star Fraction even makes a reference to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a> at
one point. Younger readers might wonder what I’m talking about. In the
early 90’s the dominant forms of communication on the Internet were
email and Usenet. The Web had just been developed, but had not yet
gained popularity, and it was competing with the similar Gopher
technology. Usenet was a system of discussion groups like modern message
forums (e.g. Reddit), but much more primitive. At the time bandwidth was
severely limited and often a concern. For playing a text-only online
game in 1992, I was banned from a computer system for excessive
bandwidth usage amounting to a few hundred kilobytes over several hours!
Email has survived, but Usenet and Gopher have both been superseded by
the more flexible Web. Bandwidth has risen to the level where HD movies
(measured in gigabytes) can easily be watched online.</p>

<p>I can imagine both authors were blinded by their closeness to their
contemporary technology to see the revolutionary change about to occur.
Thus their books are now quaintly dated. It is interesting to compare
this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>. Written
a decade earlier than the other novels and dealing heavily with computer
networks, it hasn’t aged too badly with its portrayal of cyberspace (a
term first coined in the book), despite being written by someone with
little background in computing. In an interview the author states that
the Net as depicted in Neuromancer was a metaphor for the media, but it
still works. Evidence of the cliche that being too much of an expert can
cloud your powers of extrapolation.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> is an interesting language to a Java
programmer that wishes they were doing more <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming">Functional
Programming</a>. As
such a person, when I saw <a href="https://www.coursera.org">Coursera</a> hosting a
course called <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/progfun">Functional Programming Principles In
Scala</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Odersky">Martin
Odersky</a> (Scala’s creator),
I immediately signed up for both the site and course. Coursera is one of
the new online education websites. They partner with various
universities around the world and and run their courses over the web.
They have some impressive courses including an AI course by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig">Peter
Norvig</a> and an Algorithms
course by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Sedgewick_(computer_scientist)">Robert
Sedgewick</a>.</p>

<p>The Scala course was 7 weeks long and took between 3 &amp; 8 hours a week to
complete (the first week was 3 hours and the last 8 hours). Each week
consisted of an hour or two of lectures (broken into 10-20 minutes
chunks) and a machine graded assignment. There was no final exam. The
lectures were a good introduction to functional programming, but did
appear to assume some programming ability (fine by me). Scala is not a
pure functional language, but the course presented as pure a subset as
possible, using immutable data structures and only the occasionally
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">println</code> as the only side-effect. It seems the language has either
greatly improved since I first used it in 2008/9 or I completely missed
the best bits back then. Now Martin covered all the stuff I remember
loving about Haskell back when I was university: lazy evaluation;
partial evaluation or currying; for/list comprehensions; and pattern
matching (although only for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">case</code> classes in Scala). The language
definitely deserves another look, especially since the tooling with
Eclipse is definitely much better now. I imagine my old <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/combinatorial-iterators-in-jav.html">Scala
combinatorial iterator
test</a>
would be much better with lazy list comprehensions.</p>

<p>Completing weekly assignments was definitely a mixed blessing. The only
difference between this course and just finding Scala tutorials on the
web was the quality of the teaching and the assignments. The assignments
reinforced that week’s concepts. However, sometimes it was hard to find
time to do them, as they are due a week after being released. Generally
though they weren’t too hard, although the last one took me around 6
hours. The assignments were graded automatically, I imagine that is the
only way thousands of assignments could be marked in the required
timeframe. Unfortunately this meant that there was little feedback other
than a overall grade and an indication of where marks were lost. Marks
were gained for passing unit tests and some syntactic tests to ensure
good code style. This means it was possible to write a less than optimal
solution, but still get full marks and no feedback as how to do it
better. I’m certain that a couple of points my answers were clumsy
implementations - I felt there must be a better way, but got no
direction as to what that could be. In this way the course can only take
you to a certain level of expertise.</p>

<p>The assignments can also be submitted as many times as desired and each
submission is graded. This made it easy to keep going until achieving
100% (as I did in each assignment). It also made me lazy. Rather than
write proper tests, I just relied on the automatic grading system. If it
said I got the question right, who am I to argue? I think the course
coordinators may have noticed students doing this during the course as
the last assignment required us to write a couple of our own tests.</p>

<p>The lack of human interaction with lecturers or other teaching staff
could be a real problem and I think this the largest issue holding back
large-scale online education. I enjoyed the course and got good marks,
but it would have been easy for me to cheat (I didn’t). I can’t believe
that a significant percentage of students wouldn’t have cheated.
Cheating was rampant when I marked university assignments and every
single one was checked by hand (which the students knew). Now with just
machine checking, it must be easier to get away with it on such simple
assignments (where the number of possible solutions is relatively low).
Harder assignments would require prohibitive amounts of time to mark.</p>

<p>Most of the problems are for Coursera in increasing the legitimacy of
their courses. I just wanted to refresh my Functional Programming
knowledge and learn Scala. Thus, I am very happy with the course and
achieved my goals. Having just completed one course I would happily sign
up for another if it caught my eye (time allowing).</p>

    <p>This excellent game is evil. It is a succubus come to drain your time
away. After a few little abortive starts just to learn the rules I
played a proper game all the way from 1066 to 1453. It took over 70
hours! And I could easily play it again (indeed I plan to do so, just
not for a while).</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusader_Kings_II">Crusader Kings II</a>
you take the role of a Count, Duke, King or Emperor and their heirs.
Guiding them through the years in dealing with their liege (if any),
their vassals, crusades, jihads, and the Mongol invasion. There is no
imposed winning criteria, players can make their own goals: create a
large empire; conquer Spain for Christendom; participate in the
Crusades. There is also DLC for playing Muslim for Byzantine players,
but I haven’t tried them yet.</p>

<p>The game is strategic in nature. Battles are fought when two opposing
armies occupy the same county and the outcome is determined
automatically by the computer. Instead gameplay is about keeping your
vassals from revolt, handling your court and most importantly ensuring a
smooth succession for your heir. Conquest revolves around finding a
reason to declare war (you have to have a valid reason) and then the
logistics of building and positioning your forces. Definitely more a
thinking and planning game.</p>

<p>The epic nature of the game lends itself to player created stories
spanning generations. RockPaperShotgun started <a href="http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/02/an-iberian-winter-crusader-kings-ii-diary-part-one/">such a
series</a>,
but it seems to have stopped after a single episode. I found myself
constructing a narrative of the mad Count Loinsech’s quest to unify
Ireland. His Mongol descendents completing the conquest of all
Britannia. Below is how the game ended at 1453 (the game-enforced forced
end-date). Count Loinsech of Munster’s heirs 12 generations later
control all of Britannia and southern Norway. Relatives also rule over
Denmark, Poland, Finland and what is left of France.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/CK2_end.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/CK2_end.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>During this game the three big tasks were succession planning, war
planning and placating or defeating my vassals. Every time my current
ruler died, their vassals would become unhappy. Large scale revolts
often resulted if the new ruler was unable to immediately stamp their
authority. Queen Lann the Cruel spent nearly her entire 12 year reign
putting down revolts in Scotland and Wales, largely because she was a
women with a female heir and my vassals were misogynists (a viewpoint
probably strengthend after they spent the last few years of their lives
in her dungeon). Patrick the Unready took 10 years to pacify his
subjects after ascending to the throne at the age of 8. This was despite
preparing for the event by hiring thousands of mercenaries and
positioning them near the worst troublemakers (I’m looking at you Duke
of Cornwall and Duke of Galloway).</p>

<p>To help avoid revolt upon succession, careful planning is required
(although a large, well funded army doesn’t hurt). This means marrying
well, ensuring your heirs are well-educated and pretenders are isolated
(or killed). Still it can all go wrong or right based on luck. Queen
Lann only came to power after she assassinated her younger brother - an
event beyond my control. King Putiata lived to be nearly 90 and survived
all his male sons and grandsons. His great grandson was not part of his
court and so out of player control, I just had to accept what the game
had generated. Luckily, Putiata had been preparing for his death for 30
years and the transition was smooth’ish. I wonder though what would have
happened had King Puiata lived another 4 months to see his last son born
(randy old bugger). Born after his father’s death, Eric didn’t inherit
Britannia, but did inherit Denmark from his mother.</p>

<p>War basically comes down to planning and then using overwhelming force.
It seemed that in battle the larger force won approximately 90% of the
time. Thus it was far more important to ensure you had enough money to
finish a war (sieges take a long time) and a good reason to start a war.
The later could take a long time to engineer. So it often came down to a
waiting game. In conquering England, I had to wait until they were
already involved in another war and then quickly sneak in and take a
county at a time. By the time I had a quarter of the country I worked to
destabilise the Kingdom enough to keep it in a constant state of war so
my forces could continue their slow progress. Apart from religious war
(which I never tried) conquering a decent sized opponent in this game is
a multi-generation endeavour.</p>

<p>This game has that “just one more turn” feeling. Despite its large scope
there is almost always something happening that require attention. It is
very good and very addictive - beware!</p>

    <p>After <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/old-dd-campaign-maps.html">posting some
maps</a>
from my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a>
campaign, I got a little nostalgic for the game. Here is a history of
that campaign in many parts (it did run for 5 years). While I would
prefer to tell the stories “in character”, my memory of the first year
or so is a little fuzzy, so this first part of the history will be
largely a statement of actions (as remembered) without too much creative
embellishment.</p>

<p>I first started playing D&amp;D in 1985, when I got the famous 1983 red box
version of the old original 1st edition basic set. With a few friends we
played a few little adventures, but it never really got any traction. It
was only in late 1987 that a permanent game emerged. We just called it
the “campaign”, although during its 5 year existence we played more than
one game. There was a single D&amp;D game that thread through the years, but
there was a significant amount of the scandalously unknown
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2300_AD">2300AD</a>, plus brief sojourns with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020">Cyberpunk 2020</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing">MERP</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_007_(role-playing_game)">James
Bond RPG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Roleplay">Warhammer
FRPG</a>. However,
we started and finished with D&amp;D.</p>

<p>The first session was held in my bedroom after school on a Friday. A
bunch of eight 12-13 year old boys. We rolled up characters, with the
special rule that each character could have one automatic 18 (the
highest possible value) in an attribute of their choice and the rest
should be rolled normally. Still most characters had two 18s - we must
have been a very lucky bunch. One of the “lucky” ones was the magic-user
Bandance, that was my character. I am also certain there was another
magic-user, Greymarel, in the party. Kur-Tas Kai, a cleric of the war
god
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dragonlance_deities#Kiri-Jolith">Kiri-Jolith</a>
(we used the Krynn dieties) might have been present, but if not was
definitely around by the second adventure. I don’t remember the rest -
most of them didn’t last long.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/B2ModuleCover.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the first few adventures we would rotate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master">Dungeon Master
(DM)</a> position among the
group. Later I took on the role permanently. I don’t know who was the
first DM, but it definitely wasn’t me. The first adventure was the
classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands">Keep on the
Borderlands</a>.
Arriving at the Keep the party was soon approached by a shadowy figure
and hired to kill the Castellan. Being adventuring neophytes, the party
neglected to demand some money upfront. The Castellan, hearing that a
group of sturdy young men from out of town had arrived, invited them to
dinner. At the dinner he suggested he had a job for the party, but got
no further. Bandance attacked and quickly killed the Castellan. The rest
of the party was shocked but regardless included in the resulting melee
with the guards. They managed to escape by starting fires in the Keep
and running into the surrounding wilderness. There the party stayed a
few days exploring the local caves before attempting a return to the
Keep in order to collect their reward. However their passage was blocked
and no reward was forthcoming. Realising they had been ripped off and
tired of trudging around the dangerous borderlands, they decided to
return home. I’m not sure this adventure went as the DM planned.</p>

<p>Next a much smaller group of players did <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgissuearticle/139/the-beacon-at-enon-tor">The Beacon at Enon
Tor</a>
adventure. I don’t remember much about this other than it was short and
involved saving a mad wizard. Nor can I remember the next small
adventure we did, Jack of Knaves (which I can’t even find on Google).</p>

<p>Next a larger group got together and played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahasia">Rahasia</a>. At this stage the group
was Greymarel, Bandance and Kur-Tas Kai plus the dwarf Kleeton, the
fighter Hugle, the thief Aeflebad and the elf Celembor (this is in notes
taken at the time). The party was hired to save an elven princess from
an evil temple. Payment this time was whatever treasure we found on the
way. As we played it, there wasn’t a great deal of combat in this
adventure. For the first (and probably last) time the party even managed
to talk its way out of a fight. The most dangerous encounter was between
members of the party itself. After the princess was saved, a fight broke
out over how to split the treasure. Bandance was on the losing side. My
notes for this adventure state “saved princess, befriended intelligent
snake, almost got lynched by party over magic items and now holds
grudge”.</p>

<p>The straight up goblin-bashing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_on_the_Hill">The Horror on the
Hill</a> was next. This
was quickly followed by the equally badly named and similar orc-bashing
of Death Dungeon. Neither of these were particularly notable and both
mainly involved constant fighting with a little exploring thrown in. I’m
certain I DM’ed these two (especially since I wrote Death Dungeon and it
wouldn’t be fair that I play it too). At this point the party added
Talin (a ranger) and a little later Ugarit (a fighter and not the right
name, but neither I nor the person playing him can remember what he was
called), but lost a couple of the others. So the group was Greymarel,
Bandance, Kur-Tas Kai, Celembor, Ugarit and Talin. However, the person
playing Celembor left somewhere around here after having personal
differences with a few other players. I remember it centered on how to
have fun in roleplaying games. Celembor said he played in a way to have
fun without caring about the other players, while the rest of the party
said it was about having fun as a group. I think this counter-argument
was lead by the person playing Kur-Tas Kai, who was becoming de facto
party spokesman. Celembor was increasingly disruptive and ostracized by
the rest of the party until he left. At this stage we started playing a
hybrid of D&amp;D with AD&amp;D and some homebrew rules. The result was combat
was quicker (with critical hits and misses) and spell-casters more
powerful.</p>

<p>The last adventure of the campaign’s early stage was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dread">Isle of
Dread</a>. Again my memory
is hazy on this and I have no notes to fall back on. The party sailed
across the ocean and investigated a semi-tropical island, killing locals
until we got tired and sailed home. By the end the campaign had been
running over a year and all the characters were level 5. This was also
the last adventure not DM’ed by me. It was also the last standalone
adventure. After this the adventures merged into one another as a
continuous story, albeit one that was largely made-up as we went along.</p>
