    <p>Gold and diamonds greatly annoy me. I was once employed by a large
mining company working on projects for a small gold mine and a large
diamond mine. It seems to me that both these materials have a market
price far beyond their intrinsic value, instead they are supported
largely by marketing.</p>

<p>Gold is seen as a store of value because of its history - it is just
accepted this is the case. However gold has few industrial uses. A small
amount is used for jewellery (surprisingly not that much - a little gold
goes a long way). Most is used for speculation for little return. Don’t
just take it from me, <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/02/09/warren-buffett-berkshire-shareholder-letter/">Warren Buffet has a similar
view</a></p>

<p>Diamonds are a little different - they are used heavily in industry for
drills and other tools requiring a very hard surface. Nearly any diamond
can do this job, not just the expensive gem quality diamonds. Although
the supply of diamonds is huge compared to this use! There are
warehouses full of diamonds. The market price is entirely manufactured
over the last century and not based on any lack of supply or natural
demand. 150 years ago diamonds were not popular gems. It was canny
marketing and monopolistic pricing from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers">DeBeers</a> that made them de
rigeur for engagement rings and the like. It’s not even a good store of
value; it is just status-seeking.</p>

<p>When I worked for a diamond mine they were troubled by the large number
of brown diamonds they were producing. These were much harder to sell
and not considered good enough for jewellery. So what did they do? They
called them “champagne”, “burgundy” or similar names and created a
market for them. Now they can sell as gems what was considered waste 30
years ago.</p>

<p>Just say no.</p>

    <p>The <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/07/the-future-in-three-images.html">previous
posting</a>
included the new logo for Jarrah Technology (website coming soon).
People who know I have poor design skills have where I stole it from.
Well, despite my membership of the “smash and grab” school of web design
(also known as “right click -&gt; view source”), I paid for this design.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/logo_shadow_vertical_unrounded.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>As part of creating a computer game, I accepted that while the coding
was under my control, any artwork would need to be outsourced. SpaceSub
will not be graphically beautiful, but hopefully it will not be ugly
either. Getting a company logo was the first part of this plan. The
other artwork has to wait until it is know what is needed.</p>

<p>The design comes from <a href="http://99designs.co.uk/">99designs</a>. I first
heard of them back when they did the logo for
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a>. They are a site for
outsourcing design work. People post design contests and designers
compete to win those contests. Here is <a href="http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/help-jarrah-technology-logo-147581">my
contest</a>.
In the end this worked well for me, I like the winning design (which I
chose). There were a few other good entries submitted to my contest.
Although most of the designs were not very good and a surprising number
didn’t even follow the submitted brief. Communication could also be a
problem, getting revisions was quite hard and I get the impression most
of the designers had English as a second language. However, the winner’s
name and timezone suggests he is Indonesian, Malaysian or Singaporean
and he (mostly) managed to adapt his entry according to requests. In the
end it worked out ok for the logo, but attempting anything more
complicated would give me some trepidation.</p>

    <p>After last week’s look back, now it is time to look forward. I expect
the next year of my life will be dominated by these images.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/640px-Kuala_Lumpur_City_View.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>At the end of this year I am moving to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur">Kuala
Lumpur</a> for my partner’s
work. I’ll be there for possibly 4 years. I’m not sure what I’ll be
doing there, but I hope to continue with this:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/spacesub.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Above are 2 player drones and a player corvette rounding a small planet
and closing on a stack of 3 enemy ships. It is from a computer game I’m
working on codenamed SpaceSub (because it’s all about stealth). It is
still in a fairly early stage of development. More news on it will be
available at:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/logo_shadow_vertical_unrounded.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>I’m repurposing <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">Jarrah Technology</a>, my
old consulting company, as an indie game developer for SpaceSub. The
website will soon be updated to reflect that new identity.</p>

    <p>On February 5th 2008, the first post on this blog was published. This is
the 201st posting, so it is time for a recap. The blog was originally to
document the creation of a business website. That business idea,
Queuesaurus, has been and gone, but the blog continues. I think it is
useful to practice writing - it’s certainly not for the money!</p>

<p>In nearly four and a half years this blog has generated 133,340 page
views from 70,904 unique visitors. This has resulted in 77 AdSense
clicks for income of $31 (versus a hosting cost over the same period of
$104). However, it is gratifying to see that the number of visitors is
on a steadily upward trend. As the graph below shows, the number of
monthly visits has grown to around 4500/month at present.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/meta/visitors.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most people visiting this blog will never read this post. 75% of people
come to it through a search engine (mainly Google) and view a single
technical article. The top ten posts account for 60% of the page views
and all of those ten are technical in nature (<a href="http://cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/multiple-attachments-with-vali.html">this is the most popular
page</a>,
and <a href="http://cordinc.com/blog/2008/03/installing-sphinx-ultrasphinx.html">this the second most
popular</a>).</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are only 14 comments on the site. I had to turn
comments off a couple of years ago because I was receiving about 50 spam
comments a day after the spam filters cleared out the most obvious ones!</p>
