    <p>It has been a while since I went somewhere new for a holiday, so earlier
this month I spent a few days in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reykjav%C3%ADk">Reykjavik</a>, Iceland. It
was all organised on short notice, and during most of the trip the
weather was overcast (so no Aurora), but the country is well worth a
visit.</p>

<p>My best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/reykjavik_18.html">available
here</a>.</p>

    <p>Some people may know that over 20 years ago a did a little <a href="/blog/2011/07/can-tweety-fly.html">postgrad
research into computational logic</a>.
While not much benefit came out of that work, it did give me an interest
in logic. So when it came time to refresh my
<a href="/blog/tag/Scala.html">Scala</a> skills, I thought it might be interesting
to try creating a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resolution_(logic)">logical
resolution</a> system. A
toy version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a>.</p>

<p>Now it is finished, and it doesn’t seem so bad. With some work it could
even grow to a full Prolog implementation. It might even be useful in
its currently limited state. So I have decided to opensource and release
it through Gitlab.</p>

<p>If interested it is <a href="https://gitlab.com/cordinc/logic">available here</a>.</p>

<p>FYI: Gitlab seems like a decent online repo site, so in the future I may
put other projects under <a href="https://gitlab.com/cordinc">my page there</a>.</p>

    <p>You may of heard about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation">GDPR</a>
recently? Or maybe just received a flood of privacy policy updates?</p>

<p>It is time for one more. Previously this website used some Google 3rd
party services that may track visitors (Adsense, Analytics and Search).
I have now turned them all off. It was a fairly easy decision to make. I
haver tracked the site analytics for many years, so why keep it on? Same
for the ads. In over 10 years of running this blog I have earned a few
pennies over £75. No loss to turn it all off.</p>

<p>There is still one service on this site that may use cookies and
tracking, if you are one of their customers already. That is
<a href="https://www.disqus.com">Disqus</a>, who provide the comments system at the
bottom of most pages. Their GDPR statement is <a href="https://blog.disqus.com/update-on-privacy-and-gdpr-compliance">available
here</a></p>

<p><strong>Update (2021-02-21):</strong> Commenting has been disabled, so no more potential GDPR issues there!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Behold! The <a href="http://www.steampowered.com/app/374150">1.3 update to Concealed
Intent</a> has been released!</p>

<p>This release is of course 6 months after it was original planned, but I
have just been too busy to get it done. I the end I took time off from
work to finish it. It has also been a financial failure, the 3000 sales
(so far) have not even covered my living costs during development (at
around 10K sales there would have been a profit). So, this will probably
be the last significant release for Concealed Intent. There may be a
small update to clean up a few loose ends, but basically the game is
“done” and “good enough”. It would take a great burst of inspiration
combined with a great deal of spare time for the situation to change.</p>

<p>Since Concealed Intent has been the main consumer of time for many years
now, what does finishing it mean? What comes next?</p>

<p>Now most of my time is spent at work - a normal weekday job. Supposedly
I am a Technical Product Manager at <a href="http://www.substantiveresearch.com">Substantive
Research</a> - a London startup working
in the post <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markets_in_Financial_Instruments_Directive_2004">Mifid
II</a>
research environment. However, most of my time is spent on programming
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">NLP AI</a>
systems on research reports (not too much management). It is quite
interesting and the conditions are good, so I have no other work plans
at the moment.</p>

<p>The problem is that SR takes up most of my time in typical startup
fashion. I would like to create further games, and have more ideas than
I could ever develop, but can’t realistically get started properly right
now. I have lost that naivety. I now know how much work it required to
create a commercial game. No longer can I just start with nothing but
optimism.</p>

<p>So the plan is to continue working at SR and try where possible to
create little game libraries or other projects for fun. If perhaps they
could be later used as building blocks towards a proper game, that would
be perfect. Although, most of the time I’ll just be a boring software
programmer employee.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last year I expected to significantly reduce the <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">balance of my Funding
Circle account</a> over the following
year. Well, the year has passed and a noticeable amount has been
withdrawn, but there is still enough there to get an idea of the
returns. So, what happened over the last year?</p>

<p>Here are the returns for the last UK tax year:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.5%<br />
After Fees: 7.5%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 6.4%</p>

<p>A lower return than last year (7%), but still a decent return, although
not as good as other investments . Gross returns and fees have stayed
roughly steady compared to last year. The decrease has come from an
increase in net bad debts. It would be nice to think this is due to
Brexit issues or a change in the site’s system reducing choice (see
below), but I doubt it. I’m fairly sure the rise in bad debts is due to
a couple of the real estate loans I added last year going under in the
dropping UK property market. Based on the loan-equity ratios for those
loans I would expect recoveries to be very high, but that takes time,
and right now the loss has to be realised.</p>

<p>Since the last report, Funding Circle have changed their system again.
It is no longer possible to choose the individual loans, instead clients
are forced to go into an automatic system based on two credit rating
buckets. I have gone for the A rated loans. Will lower customer
involvement result in better returns? I’m not sure in the current
environment. Thus I will continue to slowly drain funds from the
account.</p>
