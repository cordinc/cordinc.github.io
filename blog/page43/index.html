    <p>Google Reader is the website I visit most often. The Reader tab is
always open on the leftmost tab of my browser. I check it second in the
morning (after my email) and periodically during the day, easily
spending an hour a day “catching up”. Since February 2008 I have read
over 250K posts from 97 feeds. I don’t use Twitter much, I find Reader
to be far superior.</p>

<p><a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">Now it is
closing</a>.
Why, why Google, why?</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/A25VgNZDQ08" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Hitler, I feel you. I don’t want my news retweeted by Stalin either.</p>

<p>It is heartening to see that so many other people online feel the same
way. I understand it was a free service and that Google has every right
to do what they want with it. Although I never had the chance to <a href="http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/12/don_t_be_a_free_user/">not be
a free user</a>.
Still, the shutdown is incredibly disruptive. Now I am far more wary of
Google’s products. As are other people, suggesting this is a bad
business move for Google by decreasing public trust in their products.
See articles
<a href="http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-end-of-reader-what-does-it-say.html">here</a>,
<a href="http://blog.priceonomics.com/post/46028291791/digging-around-in-the-google-graveyard">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/03/utilities">here</a>.
Of course, I found all of those through Reader!</p>

<p>Now I am going through all the free online products I use and imagining
their disappearance. Most are unimportant - I wouldn’t care if they were
shutdown. However, there are a few that would cause me concern. A couple
of these are free Google services. I will have to research alternatives - just in case. I’ll certainly think twice about replacing existing
offline services with online ones.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I’ve switched to <a href="http://theoldreader.com/">The Old
Reader</a> for RSS feeds. Just trying it out at
the moment. It is nothing fancy, a bit slow, but does everything I need.
So I will probably stay.</p>

    <p><em>I recently wrote this article for the internal High Commission
newsletter - thought it could go here too.</em></p>

<p>Determined to get out and about more, we booked ourselves on the <a href="http://www.mmadventure.com">MM
adventure</a> Firefly tour. We were picked up
from outside a local hotel mid-afternoon (with two other tourists) and
driven through the palm plantations around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Selangor">Kuala
Selangor</a> to Bukit
Melawati, followed by dinner, and finishing with the fireflies. If the
traffic is good there are other stops, but unfortunately for us the
traffic was bad.</p>

<p>Bukit Melawati is the suprise highlight of the day, with a train trip to
the top to feed the local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silvery_lutung">Silver Leaf
Monkeys</a>. The photogenic
monkeys are surprisingly well-behaved - happily leaving people alone if
there is no food visible. Although they quickly move to grab any food on
offer (sweet potato is definitely a crowd pleaser). If the food is out
of easy reach, you will soon find a mohawked monkey perched on your
shoulder or head, perhaps with an unsteady baby monkey in tow.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/monkeys.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Dinner is a set seafood meal at a local Chinese resturant on the
Selangor river as the sun sets. Then it is on to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefly">fireflies</a> at an eco tourist
center (restoring palm plantations to firefly habitat). Rowing down the
river the fireflies flash in overhanging trees like a cheap christmas
light show. The boat often getting so close passengers are brushed by
the strobing branches. Then it is back home by around 9.30pm after a
very enjoyable day - recommended.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently we spent a long weekend on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_Lanta_District">Koh
Lanta</a> in southern
Thailand. From KL it is a short (and cheap on <a href="http://www.airasia.com/my/en/home.page">Air
Asia</a>) flight to Krabi and then
a transfer to the island itself. Koh Lanta bills itself as a less
party-oriented than other nearby resort areas (like <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Ko_Phi_Phi">Koh Phi
Phi</a>). This is definitely a
relative measure, as a drive along the island’s main beaches showed
packed tourist shops, bars and hotels. Although, the further south down
the island we went the less touristy it became.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/Koh_Lanta_north.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our hotel, <a href="http://www.lalaanta.com/">LaLanta Hideaway</a>, is the most
southerly on the island and backs onto a national park. Thus it is quiet
and remote from the tourist strip - which is exactly what we wanted. The
weekend was spent lazing around the hotel and the beach it backed onto.
We walked, swam, kayaked, had a massage, and ate. A very relaxing trip.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/Koh_Lanta_south.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The only downside is the transfer from Krabi airport to the hotel. It
took 2 hours 20 minutes on the way out and 3 and a half hours on the way
back (when we got caught in traffic). Compare this to the flight time of
1 hour 30 minutes.</p>

    <p>I have a problem with ideas. Not that I don’t have any, but that I have
too many. Admittedly most of the ideas aren’t very good or are totally
impractical, but they still take time to evaluate. Furthermore, a new
idea is exciting. When I first think of something new it can consume my
thoughts for days - both with evaluation and fantasy. As a result other
tasks suffer - <a href="http://sivers.org/multiply">ideas are worthless, execution is
everything</a>.</p>

<p>When I wanted to write a computer game, three months worth of ideas and
notes went into a document. By the end of that time there were 9
different ideas in there. The best (and most importantly, simplest) idea
became <a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">Concealed Intent</a>. The other 8
are not practical or not interesting enough to see to completion.
Although all are still sitting in that archived document - a couple are
games I would play, but they are just too ambitious for a small team.
Concealed Intent was the best idea by a good distance.</p>

<p>A couple of other idea have come along during development. After a few
days thought, they went into the archive with the others. Now I have had
another idea. A great idea. A better idea than Concealed Intent. It
requires simpler coding (no 3D). It is easier to play and more
accessible. The story is emergent based on play. It could even be a
casual free-to-play web game for maximum reach. I have several hours
developing the day. Time that would otherwise be spent on Concealed
Intent and thus development on the latter has slowed.</p>

<p>What to do? I think I need to <a href="http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/44181247500/making-it-in-indie-games-starter-guide">finish what I
started</a>.
Many ideas will come along, but the main focus has to be completing
Concealed Intent. Otherwise I will be forever starting something and
then dropping it for the latest great idea. Still, a few hours now and
then on the new idea can’t hurt too much, right?</p>

    <p>This is the story of the 5-year
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign I
played in while at high-school. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/dd-campaign-history-part-1.html">Part 1 of the
story</a>
follows the ever-changing party through a series of unconnected dungeon
crawls. Now after about a year of play, the group has settled down into
a bunch or regulars around level 5 under the old first edition D&amp;D
rules. Having gained significant powers, money and notoriety they are
becoming noticed by local rulers.</p>

<p>The party consisted of 5 characters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Bandance - a pyromaniac evil wizard, often getting in arguments with
the rest of the party</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Ugarit - a fighter</li>
</ul>

<p>The party sailed into Karameikos on their return leg from the primitive
southern isles they recently explored (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dread">Isle Of
Dread</a>). Before heading
back to their home in the northern borderlands a week’s march to the
north, they planned to spend a few days in the large civilised city -
enjoying its delights and spending their recently acquired gold. They
quickly found themselves surrounded by the city guardsmen and required
to present themselves to the local Duke (technically their liege, as
their hometown was just inside his territory). He had a proposition. A
distant ally of the Duke required some irregular soldiers to deal with a
number of hostile nomads raiding his lands. If the party agreed to help
the ally he would pardon a number of treasonous offences they committed
in the course of their earlier adventures (aiding certain hostile
northern Elvish tribes). The party agreed and went to join the foreign
army as it assembled. Thus started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Desert_Nomads">Master of the Desert
Nomads</a>.</p>
