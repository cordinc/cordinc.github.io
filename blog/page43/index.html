    <p>I have a problem with ideas. Not that I don’t have any, but that I have
too many. Admittedly most of the ideas aren’t very good or are totally
impractical, but they still take time to evaluate. Furthermore, a new
idea is exciting. When I first think of something new it can consume my
thoughts for days - both with evaluation and fantasy. As a result other
tasks suffer - <a href="http://sivers.org/multiply">ideas are worthless, execution is
everything</a>.</p>

<p>When I wanted to write a computer game, three months worth of ideas and
notes went into a document. By the end of that time there were 9
different ideas in there. The best (and most importantly, simplest) idea
became <a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">Concealed Intent</a>. The other 8
are not practical or not interesting enough to see to completion.
Although all are still sitting in that archived document - a couple are
games I would play, but they are just too ambitious for a small team.
Concealed Intent was the best idea by a good distance.</p>

<p>A couple of other idea have come along during development. After a few
days thought, they went into the archive with the others. Now I have had
another idea. A great idea. A better idea than Concealed Intent. It
requires simpler coding (no 3D). It is easier to play and more
accessible. The story is emergent based on play. It could even be a
casual free-to-play web game for maximum reach. I have several hours
developing the day. Time that would otherwise be spent on Concealed
Intent and thus development on the latter has slowed.</p>

<p>What to do? I think I need to <a href="http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/44181247500/making-it-in-indie-games-starter-guide">finish what I
started</a>.
Many ideas will come along, but the main focus has to be completing
Concealed Intent. Otherwise I will be forever starting something and
then dropping it for the latest great idea. Still, a few hours now and
then on the new idea can’t hurt too much, right?</p>

    <p>This is the story of the 5-year
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign I
played in while at high-school. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/dd-campaign-history-part-1.html">Part 1 of the
story</a>
follows the ever-changing party through a series of unconnected dungeon
crawls. Now after about a year of play, the group has settled down into
a bunch or regulars around level 5 under the old first edition D&amp;D
rules. Having gained significant powers, money and notoriety they are
becoming noticed by local rulers.</p>

<p>The party consisted of 5 characters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Bandance - a pyromaniac evil wizard, often getting in arguments with
the rest of the party</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Ugarit - a fighter</li>
</ul>

<p>The party sailed into Karameikos on their return leg from the primitive
southern isles they recently explored (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dread">Isle Of
Dread</a>). Before heading
back to their home in the northern borderlands a week’s march to the
north, they planned to spend a few days in the large civilised city -
enjoying its delights and spending their recently acquired gold. They
quickly found themselves surrounded by the city guardsmen and required
to present themselves to the local Duke (technically their liege, as
their hometown was just inside his territory). He had a proposition. A
distant ally of the Duke required some irregular soldiers to deal with a
number of hostile nomads raiding his lands. If the party agreed to help
the ally he would pardon a number of treasonous offences they committed
in the course of their earlier adventures (aiding certain hostile
northern Elvish tribes). The party agreed and went to join the foreign
army as it assembled. Thus started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Desert_Nomads">Master of the Desert
Nomads</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After completing a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Scala
course</a>
on <a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> in November, I was ready to try
another. Since I have an interest in astronomy I signed up for the <a href="http://duke.edu/">Duke
University</a> <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/introastro">Introduction to
Astronomy</a> course. After
eight weeks of lectures and assignments it has just finished.</p>

<p>Whenever there is an astronomy documentary on TV, I usually tune in for
at least the first few minutes. Normally I turn them off fairly quickly
as most are aimed too low or just go too slow. The last one I watched
contained about 15 minutes worth of information in it’s 60 minutes run
time. There was no similar problem with this course. While it started
gently with positional astronomy and Newtonian physics, it quickly moved
on with a week each on planets, stars, stellar evolution, relativity,
galaxies and cosmology.</p>

<p>While many of the facts in the roughly 3-4 hours of lectures per week
were not new to me, the course also covered how those facts are
mathematically determined. Thus while a documentary my say something
like “after 10 billion years the Sun will start to expand”, this course
goes further. It presents the maths to calculate the amount of energy
released by nuclear reactions in a star’s core; how quickly the fuel for
these reactions is exhausted and how the pressure inside the star
changes at this point (including quantum effects like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure">electron
degeneracy
pressure</a>).
The maths stops just short of calculus (thus many formulas are presented
without derivation), so high school level is adequate to understand
everything presented.</p>

<p>There was an assignment every week requiring usage of the maths
presented to solve various problems. This is where the course let itself
down. The first assignment was hard, had a one week deadline and did not
inform the student where they were going wrong. After close to 16 hours
of effort I submitted on time and as the deadline passed received my
grade of 95%. Although I was quite proud, I did not have the time to
continue with the course if the future assignments continued in the same
fashion. The hours were not reasonable, especially for a course that
advised spending 6-8 total hours/week. However, it seemed that many
other people complained, so all further assignments had a 3 week
deadline, allowed multiple submissions and gave instant feedback. Still
assignments normally took me around 6 hours - so the course was an
unexpected time sink. Furthermore, the lectures and marking scheme often
contained mistakes that impacted assignment questions. It is extremely
frustrating to try solving a problem, getting feedback that it is wrong
and spending time trying to work out the error when it is in fact a
mistake caused by the lecturer! I soon learned to wait and only start
assignments after they had been available a week (by which time the
errors had been spotted and fixed).</p>

<p>A very interesting and informative class - unfortunately marred by
assignment errors and required more time than expected.</p>

    <p>Over last last weekend was both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day">Australia
Day</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaipusam">Thaipusam</a>. I went to both and
saw how they are celebrated here in KL in different ways.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/Flag_of_Australia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Australia Day appears to be the premier event in the local diplomatic
community. The Australian diplomatic mission is one of the largest in
town and they aim to impress with their national day celebrations.
However, it wasn’t like any Australia Day event I’ve been to before. For
a start the invite said lounge suit. My memories of Australia Day are
t-shirt optional (because there is a pool) with a BBQ followed by
fireworks and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_J_Hottest_100">Hottest
#100</a>. The event
here is far swishier. It was held in a large exhibition hall, with
projection screens and unobjectionable Australian music playing.</p>

<p>My first impression was of a school ball. Not helped by the first food
station encountered being a chocolate fountain. Although after that the
comparison fails, with a large array of excellent food options
available, including Waygu beef,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamington">lamingtons</a> and a whole fresh
tuna flown in specially that day (morning in Australia, evening in KL).
All presented on little bite-sized dishes so it was easy to try a wide
range of dishes. The audience appeared to be largely the KL diplomatic
community with some local VIPs. Speaking to many of them, they were
deeply impressed with the event and the cost implied. It seems the
Australians set the bar high and dare other diplomatic mission to try
topping it. With austerity all the rage in the rest of world, I don’t
think anyone else makes the attempt.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/thaipusam.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thaipusan is a Hindu festival from southern India, where followers make
offerings to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan">Murugan</a>. This may
be in the form of a pot of milk or the hair from a freshly shaved head
or even piercing the body with needles and hooks. In Malaysia, the
holiday is held at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Caves">Batu Caves</a>
with over a million visitors during the 3 day event.</p>

<p>We visited on the first night and rarely have I seen so many people. The
caves were packed shoulder to shoulder, as were the stairs upto the
caves and the assembly area. Around that was a large expanse of food
stalls, trinket shops, shrines, head shaving areas and more. All rammed
with more people. Gratifyingly, the large red crescent blood donation
area was also completely full. It was a bit overwhelming. There was loud
drumming, people hooked (literally) into decorated canopies, and colour
everywhere (mainly yellow). It was all quite good natured.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>The past weekend was <a href="http://globalgamejam.org/">Global Game Jam 2013</a>.
A gaming event where various teams create games in just 48 continuous
hours. It is not a competition; there are no prizes. The teams are
supposed to be formed at the event (not pre-formed) and the theme for
the games is announced at the start. This is to ensure the games are not
prepared in advance - they actually took just 48 hours to build. The
teams create their games at organised locations around the world and
there is a generally friendly atmosphere. In Kuala Lumpur, the event was
held in the quite plush library of <a href="http://gamedev.kdu.edu.my/">KDU University
College</a>. The bookshelves were taped off,
but there was still plenty of space and seating.</p>

<p>I only heard about this event a few hours before it began, so didn’t
participate. However, the location was open to the public at the end of
the 48 hours, when the finished games would be presented. At KL there
were 5 teams creating games around with the theme being the sound of a
heartbeat. Here are pictures of the teams presenting their games (click
on the image to go to their game page on the GGJ website).</p>

<p>I was quite impressed by the games considering how long they had to
develop them. Getting anything going in that timeframe is an
achievement. They put my productivity to shame. Although I suspect
looking around the room a few people were only awake due to caffeine and
sugar. Bath and bed were probably in the near future for most of them. A
couple of the games looked particularly good. I could see them going on
an app store as simple games with a little more polish.</p>

<p>Most of the participants were students of Game Design &amp; Development at
KDU (only 2 women though, so the standard male-female ratio in computing
continues here). Furthermore, there appears to be an active game
development community in KL. I had feared that most game development
would be sucked south to Singapore (where I know there are a couple of
studios). However, this seems to not be entirely the case. With a
university course, an active <a href="http://www.igda.org/">IGDA</a> chapter and at
least one studio which turned up to see the games too, I hopefully won’t
feel isolated.</p>

<p>It was also interesting to note that all the games were developed using
Unity3D. I think the free Unity tool really helps overcome many of the
barriers in writing modern games. I started writing simple text and
sprite games as soon as I learnt to program as a teenager in the
mid-80’s. Most of the motivation for wanting to code came initially from
wanting to make games. These primitive attempts were not too far removed
from the commercial games of the time in look and feel. It was clear how
one could write a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga">Galaga</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuckie_Egg">Chuckie
Egg</a> given the time and
motivation. However, after
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(video_game)">Doom</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_(video_game)">Quake</a> I
think the perceived difficulty in creating a decent game greatly
increased. It would be nice to think that tools like Unity and events
like the Game Jam, help encourage people to program by making it seem
again possible to create decent games.</p>
