    <p>No, I’m not agitating for Tasmania to have its statehood revoked.
Instead I want simpler state machines in programming. I’m a fan of the
model of programming where the core of the system is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine">state
machine</a> firing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming">events</a> on state
transitions. Listeners on those events then perform actions, possibly
changing the state themselves. It doesn’t fit every scenario, but it
works well in those places it can be applied.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on a few such systems and a major determinant of eventual
success is the complexity of the state machine. Sometimes this
complexity is caused by the state machine encoding multiple state flows.
The system would be simpler with a set of separate discrete state
machines, each with a distinct main flow. I think software engineers can
get obsessed with trying to find a single comprehensive solution to a
problem. This can blind them to seeing a more understandable solution by
breaking the system into smaller parts.</p>

<p>Below is a state diagram similar to one I saw recently at the start of a
project (I have actually simplified it a little, removing domain
specific states and transitions for anonymity).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/complex.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>This doesn’t look right to me. Multiple start and end states, a loop,
and if a few more error states are added the diagram starts looking like
a spiderweb. Diagrams which have allowed designers/developers to express
their artistic side (I once saw one in the shape of a phone) are a good
sign that there may be too many states. In this domain there are really
three interlocking flows which have just been placed together. Each of
the three flows represents the state of communication with a different
external system. There is no need for them to be combined. It makes more
sense to separate them. Looking at this, and with a bit of domain
knowledge (just trust me), it can be equivalently expressed by the
diagram below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/simple.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>I think this is much better. It involves a few more states in total, but
each individual flow is easier to understand. The domain object holding
the current state now has three state variables rather than one. The
state of the whole system is now the combination of these three state
variables. This more accurately describes the current state and adds
more flexibility for adding new states or transitions later. It is also
possible to split the transition listeners into one for each flow, thus
making them more focused events.</p>

<p>There are a few differences between the two state diagrams above. The
three flows will have some interaction and the extra states are there to
aid this. For example, the middle flow shouldn’t go to the <strong>Process</strong>
state until either <strong>Enrich</strong> or <strong>Response Received</strong> has been reached.
In the simplified diagram there are added <strong>Init</strong> and <strong>Pending</strong>
states to act as placeholders while waiting for other events to occur.
All three state variables start in the <strong>Init</strong> state, and as events
occur they move on independently. The event that moves the middle flow
on to <strong>Process</strong> is the event fired after one of the other flow’s
transitions.</p>

<p>In 14 years how many times has decomposing a complex state diagram been
beneficial on my projects? Three. Is it guaranteed to work? No. Will it
work for you? Maybe. Think about it next time you find yourself staring
at a complex state diagram.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I grew up on a building site. Not literally, but effectively. For a
decade of my youth a building site was always just a short walk or bike
ride away. We were one of the first families to move into the suburb of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeming,_Western_Australia">Leeming</a> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia">Perth</a>, which
developed from just a few houses to several thousand over the years we
were there.</p>

<p>In the late 1970’s Perth expanded into several new suburbs that had
previously been farmland or bush. One of these was Leeming. Ours must
have been within the first dozen houses built in the suburb. When we
moved in, the house next door was under construction - every other side
was bush. There were a few houses around the corner and several on
Gracechurch Crescent, although most of those were display houses. Over
time the land was cleared, blocks marked out and buildings would rise.
The bush over the road was turned into a park. The foreign cliche is
that Australians have kangaroos jumping down their streets. It is
virtually never true, Australia is a very urbanised country and
kangaroos generally don’t like cities. I never saw kangaroos on the
street, but there were some in the bush over the road as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goanna">small
goannas</a>, snakes and spiders. I
remember a goanna eating the strawberries in our front garden. Apart
from the spiders (which were everywhere), these animals slowly
disappeared.</p>

<p>The building sites that replaced the bush were much more fun for play.
All the local kids knew the rhythm of a new build. We could run around
the original sparse bush, but when the land was cleared and flattened
the games were paused. Then a concrete pad was laid to act as a
foundation for the house which offered a few minutes of interest. We
returned to the site while the walls (2 layers of brick with a small air
gap between them) were erected. This was the best time on site. We could
run round the rooms, hide behind half built walls in games of chase or
something more violent (cops &amp; robbers, throwing tennis balls at each
other). Also there would be bits of metal or broken bricks to
investigate or throw around. Normally there was a large pile of yellow
sand for the cement mixer that was useful for making sand castles and
the like. A few kids liked making tunnels in the piles of sand using
detritus from the build as supports. I help make some of these, but
never went inside, I was a little too claustrophobic. I heard a few kids
around Perth died when such tunnels collapsed, but there was never a
collapse in our area (that I knew about). When the walls were complete
the roof went on. The sand would disappear to be replaced by piles of
tiles. I can only assume the builders knew a few would be broken after
school hours. Once the roof was finished, the windows and doors quickly
went in. That was the end of the site for play. No one I knew broke the
windows or into a house - it always seemed easier just to move onto the
site next door. Lastly someone would move in and we would see if any new
kids were around. A couple of times we went and knocked on the door and
asked if there were any children who wanted to play.</p>

<p>As time passed the distance to new sites grew ever larger, corresponding
with lessening interest in playing on them. A few years into school I
had to travel to the other end of Leeming to find a site (there were
some big ones over there - retail buildings, schools, a large road). I
didn’t do this often. Although I remember one friend, Stephen, who had
just moved to the area and like to explore the sites, so I kept my hand
in. By the mid 80’s we moved out of the area and I haven’t played on a
building site since.</p>

    <p>After 4 and a half years of service, my laptop (underpowered when I
bought it) is finally beginning to give up. It gets very hot, too hot to
touch just running <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> and
<a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes</a>. Trying to watch a video longer
than 30 minutes usually results in a stall or sometimes even a crash. It
has had a good run, but it’s time for a new one, especially considering
how much I use my computer for work and leisure. So I decided to build a
new desktop - below are the before and after pictures.</p>

<p>It can sometimes seem as if <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">The Open
University</a> provides an inexhaustible supply of
quality history podcasts, and here I review another. “Power and People
in Ancient Rome” is a 7 episode series (plus a short introduction
audio-only podcast) looking at structures for large-scale entertainment
in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Ancient Rome</a>. Apart from
the introduction, all the episodes are video podcasts presented in
documentary fashion - images of the modern sites with narration. The
episodes range in length from 1 minute (12MB) to 5 minutes (54MB) are
available in 640x260 format (or smaller) with transcripts. Disturbingly,
the filenames include numbers suggesting there should be at least 15
episodes in total.</p>

<p>Prominent Roman citizens often commissioned public buildings glorify and
memorialise themselves and promote civic pride in Rome. Very rich Romans
(like the Emperors) sometimes built structures for large-scale
entertainment. These podcasts look at some of these buildings, why they
were constructed and what happened within them. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Maximus">Circus
Maximus</a> was constructed
around the 1st century BC (and updated by
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a>) could hold an
audience 150000 for chariot races. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Marcellus">Theatre of
Marcellus</a>, also
constructed by Augustus, could hold 14000 people. The famous
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a> built around 80AD
handled around 50000 people for gladiatorial events and other
spectacles. Its seating was organised by law so that only the richest
and most powerful could sit at the front, with bands of increasingly
poorer people behind them. The furthest seats were for women, even
slaves sat before them. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baths_of_Caracalla">Baths of
Caracalla</a> were an
extensive bath complex covering 30 acres, including pools, libraries and
gardens. These massive sites must have been impressive and almost
overpowering to the people of Rome.</p>

<p>Interesting and worth watching.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Time again to reassess and reset goals. Last year <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/01/new-goals-again.html">my goals
were</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Blog at an average rate of at least 4 times a month. Result:
achieved.</strong> - This was close, publishing the 48th post just a few
days before the end of the year. At points during the year I found
myself forcing out a post over a weekend (normally a history podcast
review), when the time could have been spent more fruitfully.</li>
  <li><strong>Only have 2 programming projects going at the same time. Result:
achieved.</strong> - This is a good system. I never did more than two
projects at once and worked to pre-decided completion points. As
well as the <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/09/blender-ogre-beginner-for-begi.html">3D engine
animation</a>
and secret project (that didn’t work out), I also did
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/12/iminra.html">IMINRA</a> and a
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/08/java-nio-server-example.html">Java NIO
server</a>
and am currently working on another quiet project. However,
focussing on 1 or 2 things at a time and finishing them means that I
now have a long list of things I’d like to do.</li>
  <li><strong>Complete 3 Blender models. Result: not achieved.</strong> - I managed
one, the
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/07/blender-tutorial-mech-model-pa-3.html">robot</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Maintain Queuesaurus and general ruby skills. Result: not
achieved.</strong> Barely did any programming outside of Java this year.</li>
  <li><strong>Run 5km in 25 minutes. Result: not achieved.</strong> - I was getting
somewhere on this goal until I injured my foot in August and haven’t
run since (it’s still injured).</li>
  <li><strong>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Result: achieved.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now for the coming year:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 3 times a month. Based on
experience of the last 2 years, this should be easy to manage and I
shouldn’t need to force myself to write anything.</li>
  <li>Only have 2 programming projects going at the same time. Despite the
backlog, I think this worked well. I will start on more of the quiet
project and more 3D programming (I want to try out
<a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>).</li>
  <li>Complete 2 Blender models - a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopolium">Thermopolium</a> and a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broch">Broch</a>.</li>
  <li>Decrease net ownership of physical goods. Might be a little hard
this year as I plan on buying a new computer this month and I’ve
already divested the low hanging fruit.</li>
  <li>Run 5km in 27 minutes. After being inactive for many months I can’t
wait to have my foot in good condition again and start running
(although more carefully from now on).</li>
  <li>Work less, travel more.</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus as a nice to do, if I have time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Maintain general Ruby and Scala skills.</li>
</ul>
