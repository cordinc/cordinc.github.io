  <div class="content">
    <p>My first “proper’ish” job was IT consulting for a small publisher that
shall remain nameless. I had paying work before, temping for a warehouse
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock-taking">stocktake</a> and as a teaching
assistant at university, but I never considered them jobs. In order to
provide a little structure to my memories posts I’m going to go through
my work and education experiences, starting with that publisher.</p>

<p>In early 1997 I began thinking that perhaps a PhD wasn’t right for me
and started perusing the University job board. There was a part-time
position to create an online presence for a publisher at a rate only a
student could consider acceptable. It was a perfect opportunity for me
to see what the world of work was like. Previously I thought I would
stay in academia forever. Thus in early 1997 I ended up in the one room
office of a small publisher with surprisingly high profitability based
on the back of low costs in Australia and high sales in America.</p>

<p>The firm was run by a nice middle aged couple, publishing books of what
essentially amounted to tables of data. They gave me a copy of their
latest book and I immediately saw the potential for them on the then
burgeoning web. They weren’t so interested in that, or at least they
acted cool on the idea. Instead I spent the next few weeks (a few hours
per week) hooking up the office computers to a local ISP, training
everyone on the Internet (email, web, some basic html, etc) and creating
a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brochureware">brochureware</a> web
presence. One exchange sticks in my memory. I asked about their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database">database</a>. “Database, what’s
that?” “Where do you keep the data you publish?” “Oh, you mean
”Quark“:http://www.quark.com/.” It turns out they kept all the data
tables as text in their publishing system.</p>

<p>The most interested person in the office was the owner’s son. At the
time the public was just becoming aware of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble">dotcom
boom</a>. He clearly wanted to
make a mark on the world and saw the possibilities in his parents’
business. One day he said he had a great idea. We could scrape the
Internet for email addresses and send all of them ads for their books. I
told him about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic)">spam</a> and
that I didn’t want to do that. There were a few other strange
conversations and I always felt a little uneasy around him.</p>

<p>The experience scared me back to my studies, but only for a while. After
sixth months, I left my PhD permanently and started fulltime at
Electrolley (but that is a whole other story). A few years later I
bumped into the son again at the shops (just before the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble#The_bubble_bursts">dotcom
bust</a>).
He said they had employed a few students to build a site for the
publisher and it was going well. No mention of the other stuff. I
checked out their site and it did indeed look good and useful. For a fee
you could subscribe to the site and get personalised access to their
data. I looked again just before writing this and they still exist and
have gone even farther, with more features including most recently
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPad">iPad</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)">Android</a>
apps. Yet I have never regretted leaving.</p>

    <p>Available on <a href="http://video.google.co.uk/videoplay?docid=-4229362271242931182">Google
Video</a></p>

<p>Murder in Rome is not a podcast like I normally review. It is a TV
program produced by the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/">BBC</a> as part of its
<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qjlw">Timewatch</a> history
documentary series (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0954240/">IMDB entry</a>).
Copies of the video are easily found through an online search; I watched
the version (obviously a TV capture) that has been on Google Video for
three years, so is presumably legit. The show is 46 minutes long and the
story is told mainly through an acted reconstruction of historical
events. There is occasional documentary style narration to provide
context - viewers with little background information will not get lost.
The acting is good, if you watch much British TV you will no doubt
recognise a few of the actors.</p>

<p>The show is about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cicero">Cicero’s</a>
defence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Roscius">Sextus Roscius</a> - accused of murdering his father in 81BC. Cicero went on to become a
consul and prominent figure in the fall of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Republic</a>. Many of
Cicero’s writings from this time still exist, including his account of
this trial (<a href="http://www.uah.edu/student_life/organizations/SAL/texts/latin/classical/cicero/proamerino1e.html">available
here</a>).
The script is primarily drawn from this source. Some other references
are found in a list of known Roman trials <a href="http://indigo.lib.uic.edu:8080/dspace/bitstream/10027/99/8/Alexander.Trials.pdf">available here as trial
number
129</a>.</p>

<p>Rome in 81BC was under the dictatorship of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla">Sulla</a> after a
civil war. Sulla <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proscription">proscribed</a>
perceived enemies of the state. According to Wikipedia, up to 9000
people (mainly nobles) were executed without trial as part of the
proscriptions and had their property seized. It was in this environment
of fear and extra-judicial killings that the trial takes place. So when
Cicero starts claiming that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Cornelius_Chrysogonus">Chrysogonus</a>,
the man in charge of the proscriptions, is the more likely murderer, I
can imagine the concern shown is real.</p>

<p>The process of the trial is somewhat similar to modern trials, but
definitely foreign (details on Roman litigation can be found
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_litigation#Formulary_system">here</a>).
Familiar components are present such as a judge, jury, witnesses and
lawyers representing both sides. There seems to be an emphasis on
justice as a desirable outcome in Cicero’s defence. However, there are
glaring differences to modern trials (at least in the western world).
Prosecutions are brought by individuals rather than the state, even for
murder. To prevent false accusations and spurious trials, if a
prosecutor loses then they are branded on the forehead with a K (for
kalumnia, meaning “false accuser”). The trials are held in the open in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum_Romanum">Forum</a>, and in the
program attracts a vocal crowd of onlookers. The process seems to rely
more on rhetoric than evidence. This is no CSI: Ancient Rome. Witnesses
are insulted if the lawyers disagree. Cicero even takes issue with
Chrysogonus’ “curled and perfumed” hair. There are no
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objection_(law)">objections</a> or
protests.</p>

<p>I can’t speak to the historical accuracy of the program, but couldn’t
find any errors after a few online searches. I was particularly glad to
see that the buildings shown had some colour on them rather than the
common and incorrect pure white (ancient Roman buildings are white now
because the paint has disappeared over time). As for the accuracy of the
trial itself, it depends how much you trust Cicero’s account.</p>

<p>Excellent, well worth a watch.</p>

    <p>No, I’m not agitating for Tasmania to have its statehood revoked.
Instead I want simpler state machines in programming. I’m a fan of the
model of programming where the core of the system is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_machine">state
machine</a> firing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming">events</a> on state
transitions. Listeners on those events then perform actions, possibly
changing the state themselves. It doesn’t fit every scenario, but it
works well in those places it can be applied.</p>

<p>I’ve worked on a few such systems and a major determinant of eventual
success is the complexity of the state machine. Sometimes this
complexity is caused by the state machine encoding multiple state flows.
The system would be simpler with a set of separate discrete state
machines, each with a distinct main flow. I think software engineers can
get obsessed with trying to find a single comprehensive solution to a
problem. This can blind them to seeing a more understandable solution by
breaking the system into smaller parts.</p>

<p>Below is a state diagram similar to one I saw recently at the start of a
project (I have actually simplified it a little, removing domain
specific states and transitions for anonymity).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/complex.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>This doesn’t look right to me. Multiple start and end states, a loop,
and if a few more error states are added the diagram starts looking like
a spiderweb. Diagrams which have allowed designers/developers to express
their artistic side (I once saw one in the shape of a phone) are a good
sign that there may be too many states. In this domain there are really
three interlocking flows which have just been placed together. Each of
the three flows represents the state of communication with a different
external system. There is no need for them to be combined. It makes more
sense to separate them. Looking at this, and with a bit of domain
knowledge (just trust me), it can be equivalently expressed by the
diagram below.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/technical/simple.png" width="550" alt="" /></p>

<p>I think this is much better. It involves a few more states in total, but
each individual flow is easier to understand. The domain object holding
the current state now has three state variables rather than one. The
state of the whole system is now the combination of these three state
variables. This more accurately describes the current state and adds
more flexibility for adding new states or transitions later. It is also
possible to split the transition listeners into one for each flow, thus
making them more focused events.</p>

<p>There are a few differences between the two state diagrams above. The
three flows will have some interaction and the extra states are there to
aid this. For example, the middle flow shouldn’t go to the <strong>Process</strong>
state until either <strong>Enrich</strong> or <strong>Response Received</strong> has been reached.
In the simplified diagram there are added <strong>Init</strong> and <strong>Pending</strong>
states to act as placeholders while waiting for other events to occur.
All three state variables start in the <strong>Init</strong> state, and as events
occur they move on independently. The event that moves the middle flow
on to <strong>Process</strong> is the event fired after one of the other flow’s
transitions.</p>

<p>In 14 years how many times has decomposing a complex state diagram been
beneficial on my projects? Three. Is it guaranteed to work? No. Will it
work for you? Maybe. Think about it next time you find yourself staring
at a complex state diagram.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I grew up on a building site. Not literally, but effectively. For a
decade of my youth a building site was always just a short walk or bike
ride away. We were one of the first families to move into the suburb of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leeming,_Western_Australia">Leeming</a> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth,_Western_Australia">Perth</a>, which
developed from just a few houses to several thousand over the years we
were there.</p>

<p>In the late 1970’s Perth expanded into several new suburbs that had
previously been farmland or bush. One of these was Leeming. Ours must
have been within the first dozen houses built in the suburb. When we
moved in, the house next door was under construction - every other side
was bush. There were a few houses around the corner and several on
Gracechurch Crescent, although most of those were display houses. Over
time the land was cleared, blocks marked out and buildings would rise.
The bush over the road was turned into a park. The foreign cliche is
that Australians have kangaroos jumping down their streets. It is
virtually never true, Australia is a very urbanised country and
kangaroos generally don’t like cities. I never saw kangaroos on the
street, but there were some in the bush over the road as well as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goanna">small
goannas</a>, snakes and spiders. I
remember a goanna eating the strawberries in our front garden. Apart
from the spiders (which were everywhere), these animals slowly
disappeared.</p>

<p>The building sites that replaced the bush were much more fun for play.
All the local kids knew the rhythm of a new build. We could run around
the original sparse bush, but when the land was cleared and flattened
the games were paused. Then a concrete pad was laid to act as a
foundation for the house which offered a few minutes of interest. We
returned to the site while the walls (2 layers of brick with a small air
gap between them) were erected. This was the best time on site. We could
run round the rooms, hide behind half built walls in games of chase or
something more violent (cops &amp; robbers, throwing tennis balls at each
other). Also there would be bits of metal or broken bricks to
investigate or throw around. Normally there was a large pile of yellow
sand for the cement mixer that was useful for making sand castles and
the like. A few kids liked making tunnels in the piles of sand using
detritus from the build as supports. I help make some of these, but
never went inside, I was a little too claustrophobic. I heard a few kids
around Perth died when such tunnels collapsed, but there was never a
collapse in our area (that I knew about). When the walls were complete
the roof went on. The sand would disappear to be replaced by piles of
tiles. I can only assume the builders knew a few would be broken after
school hours. Once the roof was finished, the windows and doors quickly
went in. That was the end of the site for play. No one I knew broke the
windows or into a house - it always seemed easier just to move onto the
site next door. Lastly someone would move in and we would see if any new
kids were around. A couple of times we went and knocked on the door and
asked if there were any children who wanted to play.</p>

<p>As time passed the distance to new sites grew ever larger, corresponding
with lessening interest in playing on them. A few years into school I
had to travel to the other end of Leeming to find a site (there were
some big ones over there - retail buildings, schools, a large road). I
didn’t do this often. Although I remember one friend, Stephen, who had
just moved to the area and like to explore the sites, so I kept my hand
in. By the mid 80’s we moved out of the area and I haven’t played on a
building site since.</p>
