    <p>I’ve been coding hard the last week or two on a secret squirrel project,
thus this blog has been a little neglected. Fear not, I have a few posts
planned once I have some spare time. For the meantime, here is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_school_special">After
School Special</a> in
honour of the UK inflation figures announced today.</p>

<p>When I was in primary school there was a strange little fad for a couple
of weeks that illustrated some concepts in supply and demand. For some
reason, I don’t remember why, one student agreed to become another’s
servant. I think the “servant” was Jason, but the “master” was
definitely Ben. In return for following Ben around and doing the
occasional little task, Jason would receive a dollar a day. It wasn’t a
real dollar. Instead every morning Ben would present Jason with a piece
of paper (about the size of an old Australian dollar note, or at least
the best approximation thereof that could be managed by ripping up our
workbooks) with “1 Dollar” written on it and Ben’s signature. Jason
didn’t think this too bad a deal since Ben was the cool kid in class and
getting to hang out with him was a blessing.</p>

<p>After a couple of days this agreement showed no sign of being forgotten.
Instead, Ben even hired a second servant. At this point a number of
other kids in the class decided they wanted servants too, and thus the
problems began. About a third of the class wanted servants, but less
than a third wanted to be a servant. A day’s wage rocketed. Over
consecutive days we started to see handmade $2, $5, $10 and $20 bills
passed around. Some kids tried to make their notes more ornate and
artistic to entice potential servants to prefer their money, which
seemed to work for a bit.</p>

<p>By this stage some of the servants were building decent piles of
worthless paper. There was a constant problem of what to use the money
for beyond servants. Some was passed around as servants subcontracted or
paid for small tasks. Occasionally someone might swap sides to get or
spend cash. However, people were beginning to lose interest in the
concept. There wasn’t much of an economy until Jason (definitely him
this time) starting making rings. By a ring I mean wire soldered into a
small loop with a shard of glass at the join. With this innovation a
whole range of backyard jewellery was produced, most of the class got
involved as master, servant, jeweller or consumer. Some people from
other classes joined in too. Prices continued their rise for another
week or so but at a less frenzied pace as people were hitting the limits
of being able make money by hand (strangely no one thought of producing
a note with greater than $100 face value, the largest real Australian
note available at the time). Then people began to print money.</p>

<p>Literally print money. I went round Ben’s place one Sunday (he lived
just round the corner) and he had obtained a toy printing press and
paper guillotine. With each crank he produced six $100 notes and he was
cranking hard! On Monday he instantly became the richest kid in class.
By Wednesday the economy collapsed and we (the boys at least) went back
to playing soccer and A-Team.</p>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> The weather_report project and the weather archive is no
more. The effort required to maintain it was too great, for more
information <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/11/the-weather-archive-is-not-mor.html">see
here</a>.</p>

<p>Today I have released my first Ruby gem:
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/projects/weather_report">weather_report</a>,
version 0.0.1. It connects to the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">BBC
Backstage</a> weather API and gets weather
observations or forecasts for thousands of cities worldwide. Don’t be
fooled by the low version number, it is usable. However, it can only
handle the BBC weather feed, requires pre-knowledge of BBC weather
location ids and is metric only (all things I plan to fix).</p>

<p>With weather_report, you can do things like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'weather_report'</span>
<span class="c1"># 8 is the BBC Backstage weather code for London, UK</span>
<span class="n">londonWeather</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">WeatherReport</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># to get the current temperature</span>
<span class="n">londonWeather</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">observation</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">temperature</span> 

<span class="c1"># to get the tomorrow's max temperature</span>
<span class="n">londonWeather</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">forecast</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">for_tomorrow</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">max_temperature</span>

<span class="c1"># and much more!</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It can be obtained through rubyforge:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">sudo </span>gem <span class="nb">install </span>weather_report</code></pre></figure>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/projects/weather_report">website with documentation
here</a>.</p>

<p>I would like to say thanks to the authors of
<a href="http://newgem.rubyforge.org/index.html">newgem</a> and this <a href="http://blog.bogojoker.com/category/rr/">rubyforge
tutorial</a>, both of which greatly
aided in weather_report’s creation.</p>

    <p>A while ago I wrote a blog post asking <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/10/is-there-dumb-money-on-intrade.html">is there dumb money on
Intrade?</a>
The short answer was probably not once the implied interest rate was
considered, unless a chain of nearly expired “easy money” trades could
be constructed. When I heard that the Goggle app engine supported Java I
was keen to try it out. So I ported my manual Intrade interest rate
calculation to Java and had it read the Intrade XML feed to check for
any contracts finishing soon with high implied interest rates.
Unfortunately, the code fell foul of Google’s time limit on reading data
from other websites. Rather than see the code go to waste, I decided to
clean it up and release it. It is a command line Java app with all the
code available under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php">MIT
license</a>. It’s
probably best to just load it up in Eclipse and run the launch file to
see it working. Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>On Saturday I played a round of golf at the <a href="http://www.clgc.co.uk/">Central London Golf
Centre</a>. The allure of this place is that it is
the nearest golf course to me in South London. They also have a driving
range, but I didn’t use this. Parking is available and there were quite
a few spaces empty on the weekend I went. Nearest train station is
Earlsfield, about 15-20 minutes walk away. Booking is required for
weekends, but tee time was fairly flexible. We arrived late but still
started when ready. It cost £20 for 9 holes and club hire (cheaper on
weekdays) - very reasonable. The hired clubs were only a random
half-set, but between the two of us we had everything except a 3 wood,
so we shared. If you need to hire and can’t share clubs with your group,
then check what you are given carefully.</p>

<p>It is a par 31, 9-hole course totalling 2,332 yards. Much of the detail
I saw online spoke of an 18-hole course, but this involves playing each
hole twice. There are four par 4’s and the rest are par 3. It is a very
straight course, the flag is clearly visible from the tee on all holes.
Only on the 9th is there any impediment to a straight driver - a small
lake. The holes are fairly tightly packed and we often encountered
players on other holes playing across ours (and did the same a few times
ourselves). It is a friendly course, good for beginners or a quick no
stress round. If I lived nearer I’d definitely consider a membership,
but my friend pointed out that it might get a little boring after
regular play.</p>

<p>One caveat though, the food at the clubhouse is awful. Walk into
Earlsfield if you want something to eat.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Software Project Management.html">Software Project Management</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Previously I wrote about big companies not using Ruby, Scala or similar
new languages because they are not mature enough, adding that this
probably wouldn’t apply in small companies. This implies an underlying
assumption - that big and small companies are different. This might be
obvious to most readers, but based on my experience it isn’t to many
people I see working in software. Much of the software development
advice around is only useful for one type of organisation, although
people get hung up on trying to apply it to everyone.</p>

<p>To me, as far as a software team is concerned, a big company is one
where there is a sizeable layer of bureaucracy. This can manifest as a
large number of political players, passive stakeholders who can greatly
change requirements, seemingly arbitrary requirements, or just filling
in forms and otherwise jumping through hoops. This is not to say that
all of this is unnecessary - some degree of bureaucracy is required to
stop developers going off on complete flights of fancy. Also government
regulation often requires development to follow a set path; a developer
doing their own thing could unknowingly expose the company to sanctions
or lawsuits. There seems to be a correlation between the traditional
measures of a big firm and bureaucracy (employees and revenues), but
they don’t always align. I have worked for a very profitable 50K+
employee firm and been allowed to do largely as I wished. While at a 50
person startup in a highly regulated (and litigious!) domain, I was
drowned in paperwork.</p>

<p>Each system has its own advantages &amp; disadvantages. Personally I prefer
working in smaller companies, or at least in parts of large companies
that have more of a small company feel. However, far more developers
work under big firm conditions, and I have met good developers who
prefer the system. So when I read about <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/04/22/killing-innovation-with-corner-cases/">avoiding corner
cases</a>
I think “yeah, lets get things done”, but at the same time realise this
might not work in an IT department of a large commercial bank. I can
also empathise with <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2009-04/episode-132-top-10-architecture-mistakes-eoin-woods">Eoin
Woods</a>
about how a Software Architect needs to be able to find and involve all
the stakeholders of a project, especially the hidden, passive ones that
can stop a project right before it goes into production - a lesson I
learnt the hard way. Although, most small firms wouldn’t even need a
Software Architect. Obviously the context of the advice is crucial.</p>

<p>Some of the best advice I ever received in software development was
while working at a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process">Rational Unified
Process</a>
consultancy in the late 90’s. The RUP is a large and detailed beast
often favoured by large companies, although the consultancy successfully
applied it to many clients large and small. This was done by never
straying from the spirit of the process, but very regularly deviating
from the written word of the process. I remember one of the owners there
telling me the first step of the RUP on a project was to work out which
bits of it you should throw out as unnecessary (the implication being
that most of it would be bypassed).</p>

<p>Basically, there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">no silver
bullet</a>. Advice is just
that, advice. Think about how the advice fits your situation - what are
the premises, and don’t just blindly follow it. I think software
projects work best where they are done by people who look to understand
their environment and can adapt - not just retrying the same old thing
that worked last time (for you or someone else).</p>
