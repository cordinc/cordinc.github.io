    <p>Available on
<a href="http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/yale.edu.1899726321.01899726329">iTunesU</a>
with a <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/classics/introduction-to-ancient-greek-history/">course
website</a>.</p>

<p>This complete university course (from Fall 2007) on Ancient Greek
History from <a href="http://www.yale.edu/">Yale</a> is the best history podcast I
have found so far. It consists of 24 lectures of about an hour’s length
each, all given by Professor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Kagan">Donald
Kagan</a>. It starts with an
introduction to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mycenaean_Greece">Mycenaean
Greece</a> before moving
onto the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Dark_Ages">Greek Dark Ages</a>
and Homeric stories. The series ends with Philip of Macedon’s victory at
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Chaeronea_%28338_BC%29">Battle of
Chaeronea</a>
and the Greek Polis’ permanent loss of independence. Along the way it
details all the major events including: the rise and strangeness of
Sparta; the rise of Athens and democracy; Persian wars; and the slow
decrease of power in the struggle for hegemony after the Peloponnesian
War. Only the 27 years of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War">Peloponnesian
War</a> seem to be under
represented in coverage (from my previous knowledge of history). Despite
4 lectures being dedicated to it in the syllabus, most of these are
taken by finishing prior topics and the buildup to the war. For the war
itself, Professor Kagan suggests looking to other sources as it it too
much to cover properly, and instead talks in detail about two related
topics - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pericles">Pericles’</a> strategy and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thucydides">Thucydides’</a> history.</p>

<p>One thing I can’t fault is the production. The podcasts are professional
from start to finish. The only blemish is Professor Kagan’s occasional
coughing, but this is a minor issue. The podcasts are available in a
number of formats on the course website: audio-only (the same mp3s that
are on iTunes); video, in both high (around 700 MB) &amp; medium (around 250
MB) bandwith forms; and, complete text transcripts. The website also
includes the notes handed out with each lecture, although these
unfortunately are without the original images due to copyright problems.
The website itself is downloadable too (albeit with only links to the
audio and video files). While videos of the lectures are available, it
is not really necessary to download them as they mainly just show Kagan
talking at his podium. Rarely does he use any visual aid during the
lectures. Thus these are excellent podcasts to listen to audio-only -
very little will be missed.</p>

<p>The lectures are often a recitation of events together with discussion
of how and why things may have occurred that way (for instance a section
on various military strategies and whether they were correct). The aim
appears to be getting the listener into the mindset of the ancient Greek
statesmen (and thus the citystates in general). A goal largely achieved
to my mind. There is less discourse on daily life (but still some).
Professor Kagan also talks a little about historical controversies and
often compares ancient events to modern history (in particular around
the use of military force). In both situations he tends to declare his
own prejudices so the listener is not led too much.</p>

<p>This is a highly recommended lecture series - interesting content that
goes into the subject with some depth and so well produced it is
surprisingly easy listening.</p>

    <p>My mobile phone company recently gave me a two-for-one dinner voucher.
Most of the qualifying venues were high-end fast food chains, but
looking through the list I spotted a little gem - <a href="http://www.cafespice.co.uk/">Cafe Spice
Namaste</a>. I had heard a few things about
this Indian restaurant near Tower Bridge, so was keen to give it a try.
We went along on a Wednesday night and there were quite a few people
there, suggesting a booking would definitely be necessary on more
popular nights. The polite head waiter spent some time checking the
voucher as we were apparently the first people to use such a voucher
there. Once that was sorted out we ordered.</p>

<p>The menu was a little different to the standard Indian. For a start it
was much shorter, just a few dishes, rather than the numerous curry
combinations found elsewhere. We had poppadoms for starters followed by
lamb shank and spiced partridge with naan and a potato/cauliflower/pea
side dish. The food was very good. The poppadoms and chutneys were
noticeably nicer than other places. My lamb shank was beautifully cooked
and the slightly spiced sauce very more’ish - when I finished my plate
was clean. The off-the-bone partridge was equally good. The portions
were a good size and after that lot (plus some beer) we were too full
for dessert. Although seeing the Belgian chocolate icecream at the next
table tempted us, we did not waver and got the bill.</p>

<p>The service was very fast and efficient. It was more expensive than
other Indian places, but also far better. Although, it was by no means
expensive by general London standards, a little over £60 before the
voucher discount (and including service). For comparison, the next best
Indian restaurant I’ve been is
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/04/fancy-restaurants-part-deux.html">Babur</a>.
Without a discount Cafe Spice Namaste is a little more expensive than
Babur, but with better food (thanks to the poppadoms) and easily better
service. This is definitely a place I’ll be visiting again.</p>

I have an interest in ancient history. Discovering iTunesU, I was in
history podcast heaven. There are numerous history lectures from many
different institutions. In the ancient history area they mostly focus on
Greek and Roman history. There is a paucity of lectures on other
civilisations. I thought I’d start writing reviews of these podcasts.
First up are three short series.</p>

<p><a href="http://deimos3.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/isc.upenn.edu.1771732267.01771732269">Great Sites Of The Ancient
World</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Podcasts from a <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/volumes/v55/n11/greatsites.html">lecture series at the University of Pennsylvania
Museum</a>.
There have been at least 8 of these lectures over the past year, but
unfortunately only three have made it online (I’m not sure if more will
become available later). Each is about an hour long. The first, on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur">Ur
of the Chaldees</a>, is audio only, but
makes constant reference to missing slides. Thankfully, the other two on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy">Troy</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abydos,_Egypt">Abydos</a> include the
slideshow video. The lectures are given by archaeologists talking about
their recent field research. As such they can sometimes become quite dry
and focussed on the technical aspects of archaeology (livened with
occasional stories and holiday snaps from the dig). However, you can
still get a feel for the excitement of discovering or unearthing
something unseen for millennia. Fans of the UK TV series <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Team">Time
Team</a> should enjoy them -
although they lack an equivalent of Tony Robinson’s translation for the
layman.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/itunes.open.ac.uk.1544964539">World
Archaeology</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Part of an <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> course, these 12
podcasts ranging from 6 to 19 minutes in length, form an introduction to
archaeology as a subject of study. The <a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/a251-podcastcourse">course has a
website</a>, as does the
<a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/pod/a251-archaeology">series of podcasts</a>,
where transcripts are available. The podcasts are audio only and have
been produced with this in mind - there is no mention of accompanying
images and the delivery is very clear. However, the series is very
repetitive. Many of the podcasts contain parts exactly the same as other
podcasts in the series. I suspect that the series actually contains
lectures from two versions of the same course. In general, if the names
of two podcasts in the series look similar, the shorter one can be
largely skipped without missing anything. In these podcasts history
takes a backseat to archaeological definitions and theories like what is
a city, how did agriculture start or empires form. Also, I found them
quite introductory (which is probably intentional) and light on
information. They quickly jump across so many times and civilisations
there is not time to dig deeper. Still there are some interesting
nuggets, but I won’t be keeping a copy of this series on my computer.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://deimos.apple.com/WebObjects/Core.woa/Browse/itunes.open.ac.uk.1619733079">Culture, identity and power in the Roman
empire</a></p>
<ul>
  <li>Another Open University series, the 6 video podcasts are presented
like short films (all under 9 minutes). Again the
<a href="http://www3.open.ac.uk/courses/aa309-podcastcourse">course</a> and
<a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/pod/aa309-cultureidentity-power">podcasts</a>
have their own websites. One is a short introduction to the geographical
and cultural extent of the empire. Two are examinations of particular
mosaics, and the remaining three look at the emperor as a force for
unity in the empire. I have to admit to a soft spot for these podcasts
as they make special mention of the Roman remains at
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dougga">Thugga</a> (also know as Dougga) in
Tunisia. I visited this site in 2008, you can see my photos
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157611388103847/">here</a>.
This series is worth a look. The podcasts are too short to go into much
detail but they have interesting visuals of current Roman sites and art.</li>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Time for a pet peeve. Why do people say “scientists” as if they are some
homogeneous group? Nearly every morning I hear reporters say “scientists
have discovered that blah, blah, blah” during their token science story.
It seems to be a lazy way to avoid saying biologist, astronomer,
chemist, physicist, etc. Now I can’t claim to be a scientist of any
description (I dropped out of a PhD in Computer Science). Professionally
I’m more of an engineer nowadays (although that is another category
occasionally lumped into the media’s science bucket). However, I know a
few PhDs or lecturers in science subjects and there is a fairly large
difference between the things they do, so it’s not that hard to broadly
differentiate them into categories more specific than scientist. Asking
them is often a good start! Also, there is rarely a mention of where or
how the work was done. I personally would be more impressed by a
statistically significant result in a double blind study from MIT than a
report from the Pond’s Institute (although TV commercials would suggest
the Pond’s Institute has nicer labs).</p>

<p>Not convinced? Try this comparison. Next time you listen to the sport
section of the news replace any mention of a specific game with “sport”
and the players with “sports players”, then just remove any mention of
specific teams. “Last night in sport, a group of sports players from
Manchester beat 3-2 a bunch of sport players from London.” Not very
informative.</p>
