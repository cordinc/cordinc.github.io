<h4>Companies are people too</h4>

<p>I recently read <a href="http://www.accelerando.org/">Charlie Stross’</a> novel
Accelerando (<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/fiction/online-fiction-by-charles-stro.html">available free online
here</a>).
Accelerando is an episodic story about multiple generations of a family
through a dark vision of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity">singularity</a>.
Like all good sci-fi it raises some interesting lines of thought, one of
which resonated with me as I was pondering a similar question. What
should the nature of companies be?</p>

<p>In Accelerando companies become self-sentient. That is they are
vechicles for artificial intelligences, which use them for independence
as there are no humans involved in running or owning these companies. It
is the technological fulfillment of the modern legal concept that
companies are people. In the novel this doesn’t end quite the way
biological humans might like - but read the book to see what happens.
For now think about whether companies should legally be people. I think
most people would find the idea silly, but most countries since the 19th
century have made corporations <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_personality">legal
personalities</a>. Thus
they are treated like people for the purposes of taxation, lawsuits and
contracts, but not for things like voting, marrying or holding office.
Recently, in the US companies even gained some free spech rights under a
recent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_United_v._Federal_Election_Commission">Supreme Court
ruling</a>
(there is a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2242210/">discussion on the ruling
here</a>).</p>

<p>I can see the need for this in civil proceedings, contracts and the
like. However, I’m not sure how it works with issues such as crime and
responsibility. A company is ultimately controlled by humans (at least
for the present, although they can already <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-11444051">conduct business without
human involvement</a>), but
liability is limited for these people in the case of any wrongdoing by
the company. The worst that will happen is bad PR, a fine or maybe the
company being wound up. While there have been large scale ethical lapses
in the recent (current?) financial crisis, only a handful of people have
been charged with any wrongdoing. There can be a disconnect between the
way people would act if their actions were attributed solely to them and
the way they act inside a company. Similarly, some people suggest that
<a href="http://www.thecorporation.com/">if corporations are people, they are
pyschopaths</a>. Others think that the
<a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/09/you-vs-corporations/">corporations versus humans
dynamic</a> in
Accelerando is already here.</p>

<p>I need to think about this further.</p>
