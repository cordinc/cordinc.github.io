<h4>Internet Memories</h4>

<p>There is a story told around the <a href="http://web.csse.uwa.edu.au/">UWA Computer Science
department</a> I occasionally retell.
Supposedly, in the early 90’s someone at the national level discovered
that a huge percentage of all internet traffic into Australia was going
to UWA. After some investigation it was discovered that most of the
traffic was overnight and into the CS department. Even further
investigation demonstrated that the traffic was to a single desktop
computer owned by one of the grad students. It was then found that this
student was running a mirror of decoded images from the
alt.binaries.erotica.*
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet_newsgroup">newsgroups</a> with
anonymous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol">ftp</a>
access. Uh oh.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>When I tell this story to old programmer friends (people who did their
degrees in the early-mid 90’s like myself) I generally get a few laughs.
As the audience gets younger, the story needs more explanation. At first
it was that the bandwidth to Australia wasn’t very large at the time,
only a few Mb/s; there are faster home broadband connections today.
People jealously guarded it - online text games were banned and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">online
chat</a> was discouraged - there was no web or commercial usage allowed. Then I had to describe
newsgroups to people who think the web and internet are the same thing,
and most recently even <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ftp">FTP</a>
(something I still use regularly today!) required explanation. Here are
some other computer/internet memories that time has passed by.</p>

<p>My first computer was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC">Amstrad
CPC6128</a> (we also had an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_2600">Atari 2600</a>, but I consider
that more of a games console than a general purpose computer). My
friends had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrums</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_micro">BBC Micros</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_mac">Macs</a> and early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC">IBM
PCs</a>. They were all different
architectures and incompatible. Amstrads used an unusual floppy disk so
I couldn’t even transfer files (there was no networking). Some other
computers used audio cassettes to store programs. They were slow to load
(taking many, many minutes), often failed or corrupted and made a
screeching noise while loading. The noise was like
“eee-aaayyy-eeee-shhhhh” (similar to old modems) and we learnt to pay
attention, because if the sound wasn’t quite right we would stop the
load straight away rather than wait for the inevitable failure message.</p>

<p>Modems were expensive and slow. They weren’t particularly useful either
until <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_service_provider">ISPs</a>
were set up in the mid-90s. Before then the only thing most people could
connect to were
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system">BBS’s</a>. I got
access to the internet when I started university in 1992. Initially I
used it rarely and only for email. In the middle of my first year I went
to a BBQ (held by the <a href="http://www.unisfa.asn.au/">science fiction
association</a>) where much of conversation was
about alt.music, comp.lang.c, rec.games.board and other alien sounding
terms. After that I learnt all about
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">usenet</a> and regularly trawled a
few groups. From there came
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> (which I never
got into), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">rogue-like games</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUDs</a>. Interacting and
communicating with people around the world was such a thrill - now it
seems normal. One guy at college even got offered a free plane ticket to
the US from a fellow MUD player, but that might have been related to him
pretending to be a woman online. Everything was text based. No sound or
pictures (unless you count <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_art">ascii
art</a>) - there just wasn’t the
bandwidth. I played a MUD based on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BattleTech">BattleTech</a> where you would
furiously type in text commands to move your robot around a text-based
map that couldn’t be seen until a “look” command was typed. It was very
frustrating, especially as the lag on a good day to the US servers was a
few seconds. Despite this I was still banned from the computer club’s
servers for playing it - all that text apparently took too much
bandwidth (presumably most of it was needed for the PhD student’s porn).</p>

<p>I remember a time on the internet before
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_spam">spam</a>. Sure there was the
occasional “Jesus will save you” post on random newsgroups, but people
would pass round email addresses without any concern. I remember there
was a book of email addresses produced called the Internet White Pages.
Along with thousands of people from the US and Europe, I was in it (they
must have scraped it from the newsgroups). I was proud, but if something
similar occurred now I would be aghast - my inbox would become a target!
The first spam message is considered to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurence_Canter_and_Martha_Siegel">Canter and
Siegel’s</a>
Green Card lottery newsgroup post. I remember repeatedly seeing this
post and how mad it made a lot of people.</p>

<p>I got my first PC in late 1993. The first two things I did with it were
installing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOOM">Doom</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a>. Doom was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareware">shareware</a>; that is, a cutdown
free version that acted as advertising for the full version. I got the
shareware version of Doom as 3 floppy disks from a local shop. The game
looked better than anything I’d seen on a PC before, it was
revolutionary. It was so engrossing I actually jumped a few times when a
monster came up behind me (much to the amusement of my friends). I
wanted Linux on my computer as it would make it easier to do uni
assignments which had to run on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Microsystems">Sun</a> unix boxes they
used in the CS department. Originally I got a quote for a “proper”
version of unix, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCO_Group">SCO</a>
wanted $4k for their operating system (and this on a $2K computer).
Balking at this I downloaded an early version of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slackware">Slackware</a>. It came with a
0.99p14 Linux kernel and to install it I had to copy it onto floppy
disks - over 80 of them. It took me days to download and days to copy to
floppy, writing the detail of each disk’s contents down as I went. It
all worked, and for coding and internet work it was far better than
Windows.</p>

<p>By the start of 1995 the utility of the internet was rapidly increasing,
mainly due to the recent creation of web browsers and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_%28protocol%29">Gopher</a>.
“Huh, what is Gopher?” you say. It was a competitor to the web that
largely did the same things. We soon discovered that the web, with is
anarchic linking and better browsers that had inline images (we used
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosaic_%28web_browser%29">Mosaic</a>
at first before going to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator">Netscape</a>) was much
better. Many of the text-based internet tools like Gopher and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archie_search_engine">Archie</a> are long
gone now. Killed by the greater functionality that greater bandwidth
allows.</p>
