<p>Available on
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=354823791">iTunes</a>
or the <a href="http://webcast.berkeley.edu/course_details.php?seriesid=1906978539">UC Berkeley
website</a></p>

<p>In between Professor Isabelle Pafford recording <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/12/history-4a-the-ancient-mediter.html">The Ancient
Mediterranean
World</a>
and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/01/history-110-roman-republic.html">History 110: Roman
Republic</a>,
she recorded a lecture series from <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>
in the Spring of 2008 on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">Roman
Empire</a>. The series consists
of 48 audio-only lectures, with most between 30 and 45 minutes in length
(and around 10MB in size). The podcasts sometimes reference slides which
are unavailable online.</p>

<p>The podcasts detail the Roman Empire from its origins in the civil wars
of the 1st century BC to the fall of the Western Roman Empire nearly 500
years later. There is a long introduction on the events leading up to
the republic’s fall and the creation of an empire. The first half dozen
lectures are essentially a recap of the end of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman
Republic</a> podcasts,
starting with the story of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulla">Sulla</a>
and running through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Julius
Caesar</a> to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Octavian</a>. Pafford points out
that the empire only looks like destiny in retrospect, and at the time
people were very unsure of the future. By comparison the end of the
empire passes very quickly. The last hundred years of decline in the
west after <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_the_Apostate">Julian the
Apostate</a> through the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome">sack of Rome in 410AD</a> to
the last emperor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus_Augustulus">Romulus
Augustulus</a> are covered
in a single lecture. Little mention is made of the east’s transformation
into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire">Byzantine
Empire</a>. Along the way we
learn about the convoluted family history of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio-Claudian_dynasty">Julio-Claudian
dynasty</a>, the
stabilising influence of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nerva%E2%80%93Antonine_dynasty">5 good
emperors</a>,
the near collapse of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_of_the_Third_Century">3rd century
crisis</a>, and
the conversion to Christianity under
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_I">Constantine</a>.</p>

<p>There is a lot of history covered during the nearly 27 hours of this
series, so I will not go through all the content. The lectures are
largely in chronological order and detail history from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_source">primary
sources</a> of the time. Thus
they focus mainly on the emperors and palace history and there are many
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Roman_emperors">Roman emperors</a>
(especially during the 3rd century crisis). There is also an interesting
and constant discussion on the reliability of primary sources. How bad
were emperors like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caligula">Caligua</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiberius">Tiberius</a> really? The sources
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suetonius">Suetonius</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacitus">Tacitus</a>) describe some
incredible events, but at the same time the sources were known to be
hostile to them. Presumably the sources couldn’t believably say too many
bad things about the more popular emperors like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus/">Augustus</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius">Claudius</a>, but could safely
exaggerate with the less well liked. As Proffessor Pafford says, the
truth behind Tiberius’ time on Capri with crowds of young children may
not be as lascivious as the sources imply, but she certainly wouldn’t
send her kids to spend summer with Uncle Tiberius!</p>

<p>Interspersed within the chronological series of podcasts are the
occasional side lecture. These include: the Roman city;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_ancient_Rome">slavery</a>; the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Ancient_Rome">role of women in Roman
society</a>; and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_ancient_Rome">Roman
religion</a>. There
is also a lecture on Roman art which unfortunately involves cases
studies on artifacts shown to the original class, but unseen by the
audio-only podcast listener. Despite this, these side lectures are among
the best of the podcasts as they give an insight into general life in
the Roman Empire and a break from the constant palace intrigue in the
main lectures.</p>

<p>As with previous podcasts, the production quality of this series is not
the best. However, for most lectures it is at an adequate level. The
podcasts are recordings of actual university lectures, so there is some
class discussion at the start of most lectures. One lecture starts with
10 minutes of talking about an assignment, including the class cajoling
Professor Pafford to give them an extension on their assignment (which
they got). There are no missing lectures. Apparently one wasn’t recorded
so Professor Pafford rerecorded it (thank you!). The first few lectures
are recorded at a low level and are hard to hear, but after that they
get much better apart from a buzz in a couple of them.</p>

<p>Professor Pafford is an entertaining lecturer and the course is full of
interesting detail. Most of the lectures have acceptable production
values. One of the better podcast series available.</p>
