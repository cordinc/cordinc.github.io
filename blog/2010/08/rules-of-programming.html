<h4>Rules of Programming</h4>
Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/General.html">General</a>
    
<br/><br/>
<p>Coder, programmer, software developer, IT engineer. Whatever it is
called, my profession has changed the way I think. I started learning to
program 23 years ago as a hobby, started studying it seriously 17 years
ago and have been doing it as a job for 13 years. Now I seem to think a
great deal straighter than I did before - straighter than when I was in
my early twenties and studying postgrad logic. By thinking straight, I
mean following a chain of logical rules to their conclusion -
determining what they imply and where any gaps in the rules or strange
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corner_case">corner cases</a> exist.
Straighter in that I can quickly work out the logical chain, identify
problems, and ignore unimportant avenues of thought. I don’t tend to
take the scenic route anymore; I go straight to the destination.</p>

<p>This makes sense to me, most of my job as a programmer is thinking
straight. Writing the code is very easy once the language is mastered.
Instead, the job comes down to solving problems with code. At the start
of a project this is done by precisely specifying the steps of the
solution in code. No ambiguity is allowed and all the possible
situations must be covered. Edge and corner cases will cause bugs, so
must be considered. As the project progresses, any changes or additions
must take into account interactions with the body of rules already
encoded in the existing codebase. As the complexity of the system
increases, so do the possible interactions and it gets harder to run
through them. This is one of the reasons big systems tend to have so
many problems and why experienced coders try to keep things as simple as
they can.</p>

<p>It seems reasonable that I have trained myself this way. I have far more
than the suggested
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)"></a>10,000
hours&lt;/a&gt; of practice. A back of the envelope calculation suggests I’m
close to 50,000 hours. That much practice is bound to etch a groove in
my thought process. Sometimes that groove is too easy to follow and I
get lost in thought, monomaniacally thinking about a system. In software
development this state is often sought out and is no bad thing, except
in your interactions with other people. Sometimes I wonder if a similar
process is at work in other professions, perhaps with less than ethical
results.</p>

<p>I studied a Business degree mid career (so far). It hasn’t been of huge
career advantage to me, as I have learnt I am happiest just coding away.
However, I did learn the basics of some other professions. There was a
semester of accounting and another of contract law. In both courses the
lecturers spent some time detailing how case law or accounting rules
were applied - explaining that it wasn’t intuitive and you just had to
follow the general rules. What!? I found it quite simple to apply the
rules and I achieved good marks with little effort. I just did the same
thing I did every day, simply swapping lines of code for case law.</p>

<p>My impression is that both law and accounting use similar thought
processes to programming - applying rules to reach a desired end state.
While programming uses exact statements of software logic; law and
accounting use the written language in laws, cases or standards. This
natural language is more malleable and open to interpretation. I
sometimes wonder if people in other professions get similarly lost in
their rules. Focussing on just beating the problem as presented to the
exclusion of other concerns. This could offer a generous excuse for the
motivation behind results like tax evasion, or dodgy financial products.</p>
