<h4>Is there free money crossing Betfair and Betdaq?</h4>

<p>It was recently suggested to me that there could be risk-free money to
be made crossing <a href="http://www.betfair.com">Betfair</a> and
<a href="http://www.betdaq.com">Betdaq</a>. Betfair and Betdaq are betting
exchanges - they allow their users to bet on various events, from the
traditional horse races to more unusual fare like netball or the UK
general election. Unlike a normal bookmaker, the exchanges don’t provide
the odds and take the opposing side of the bet. Instead the odds are
determined by other users and the other side is another user. So while
there may be someone offering 1.15 odds that Labour will win (a <a href="http://help.betfair.com/contents/itemId/i65767719/index.en.html">back
bet</a>)
the next UK election, someone else may offer 1.2 that they will lose (a
<a href="http://help.betfair.com/contents/itemId/i65767719/index.en.html">lay
bet</a>).
When the back and lay odds match then a bet is made. Note, all the odds
quoted in this article are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-odds_betting#Decimal_odds">decimal
odds</a> as
this is the type of odds used on the exchanges.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>While Betdaq and Betfair are two different companies and run their own
separate exchanges, there is a great deal of overlap in the events on
which they allow betting. Thus it is possible that the lay odds on one
exchange are less than the back odds on the other. If this is the case,
then by placing a lay bet on one and a back bet on the other, a profit
will be made regardless of the actual result. For example, in theory, if
I back Labour to win the next election for £10 at 1.2 odds then I profit
$2 if Labour wins and lose $10 if they lose. If I lay Labour to win the
next election for £10 at 1.1 odds, then I lose £1 if they win and profit
£10 if they win. If I can make both bets at the same time, then if
Labour wins I profit £1 (£2 from the back bet minus £1 from the lay) and
if they lose I’m even (£10 loss on the back and £10 gain on the lay).
Risk free <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrage">arbitrage</a>!</p>

<p>A friend watched the two exchanges manually and saw that occasionally
the odds on the same event crossed. Does this mean there is money to be
made? Let’s see.</p>

<p>In the general case, a back bet of size £X at P odds will cost £X, and
in the event of a win return £XP, resulting in a profit of £X (P-1). For
a lay bet of size £Y at Q odds, the cost is £Y (Q-1), if the bet wins
then it returns £YQ for a profit of £Y. To hedge a back bet the cost of
the back has to be matched by the profit on a lay, which according to
the above means that X = Y (i.e. the lay bet has to be the same size as
the back bet). If this hedge is to be profitable then the cost of the
lay has to be less than the profit on the back. That is:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">       <span class="no">Y</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Q</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">X</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">P</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">but</span> <span class="no">X</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="no">Y</span>
    <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="no">X</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Q</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">X</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">P</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> 
    <span class="o">=&gt;</span>    <span class="no">Q</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">P</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span> 
    <span class="o">=&gt;</span>      <span class="no">Q</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">P</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Thus, as long as the lay odds are less than back odds it is possible to
make a risk-free bet by hedging the back with an equivalent sized lay
and the profit will the difference between the back &amp; lay odds multipled
by the bet size.</p>

<p>So far so good, but the exchanges charge a fee on any winning bet
(losing bets are free). For both exhanges this fee is expressed as a
percentage of the profit on the bet and starts at 5% (although this can
drop based on activity). How does this fee affect the equations above?
Let Z be the fraction of the profit left after fees, that is if the fee
is 5% of profit, Z=0.95. Then a back bet of size £X at P odds will cost
£X and will result in a profit of £XZ (P-1) for a win. For a lay bet of
size £Y at Q odds, the cost is £Y (Q-1), for a profit of £YZ. Thus to
hedge a back, the back cost must equal the lay profit, X = YZ. The size
of the lay has to be X/Z (which since Z has to be less or equal to 1,
means the lay has to larger than the back). The hedge is profitable
when:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">      <span class="n">cost</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">lay</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="n">profit</span> <span class="n">on</span> <span class="n">back</span>

    <span class="o">=&gt;</span>     <span class="no">X</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">Q</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">XZ</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">P</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> 
    <span class="o">=&gt;</span>        <span class="no">Q</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Z</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">P</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="o">=&gt;</span>          <span class="no">Q</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="no">Z</span><span class="o">^</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">P</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This means that if the back odds are 1.2 then the lay odds have to be
1.18 (to 2 decimal places) at 5% fees and 1.19 at 2% fees. The
difference between back and lay odds only diverges further from there.
As shown in the graph below.</p>

<p>Armed with this extra information I manually checked whether Betfair and
Betdaq markets cross to this degree. While there are regular crosses, I
never saw the exchanges cross enough to make a profit.</p>
