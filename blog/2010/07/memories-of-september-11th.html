<h4>Memories of September 11th</h4>

<p>Some friends of mine are getting married this September 11th. Apparently
that was the only date available when they booked locations. It seems
people want to avoid that date for the obvious reasons. On <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks">September
11th 2001</a> I was in
the US staying with friends in the town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick,_Maryland">Frederick,
Maryland</a>. I was
halfway through an round-the-world holiday, and the next day I was
scheduled to go to New York to stay with another set of friends.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Frederick is a pretty little colonial town where the residents seem to
be largely commuters. Most people there including Katrina and Chris,
work in surrounding towns - one of which is Washington, DC. I did a
postgrad degree with Katrina. Soon after graduating she married and
travelled to the US for Chris’ work, although she quickly got a job at
the same international engineering firm. On the day, Chris took the day
off work (it was a Tuesday) to go with me to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg">Gettysburg</a>, while
Katrina was going to work as normal. Just as we were leaving we saw on
the news that a plane had crashed into one of the World Trade Centre
towers. Initially it didn’t look that serious, and there wasn’t much
information or any pictures of the incident. There was just what seemed
to be a small plume of smoke coming from the tower. I assumed when they
said plane they meant a small plane. Chris and I left. Arriving in
Gettysburg after a short drive, we stopped to pick up a packed lunch at
a local deli. As we walked in there were half a dozen people staring at
the TV. The second plane had just crashed into the other tower and this
time there were explicit pictures.</p>

<p>We stared at the TV with the others until lunch was ready and then went
to the Gettysburg battlefield. I remember seeing an exhibition showing
the broad outline of the battle in the museum. There was a small
auditorium with steeply banked seating. The “stage” was a map of the
battlefield. Little lights blinked on and off to show the location of
events in the battle with a recorded commentary. I don’t remember much
of the exhibition’s content other than it was a deadly battle - my mind
was elsewhere for most of it. We went to start a tour of the
battlefield, but Chris had a call from Katrina saying that another plane
had hit the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon">Pentagon</a>, a
fourth had crashed in Pennsylvania and that most people in the office
were going home, including her. We walked for a little bit, but Chris
soon asked if I would like to stop the tour and go back to their place.
I said yes, so we left straight away. I was happy to go; it was hard to
concentrate on my surroundings. Chris appeared concerned too.</p>

<p>We got back to the house, sat down and watched TV. I think we got back
after the towers collapsed, but it is hard to remember as the footage of
the towers being hit and collapsing were played on a loop. Almost all
the channels were dedicated to live news. I remember thinking that it
must be serious because no channels were showing Star Trek (a running
joke on my trip - as it always seemed to be on). Not sure if I said that
out loud as the mood was very serious. There was a general concern over
what would be coming next and a sense of “if they can do this, what else
can they do?” It was around this time that I discovered that the house
was walking distance to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Detrick">Fort
Detrick</a> a US military base
where the national chemical weapons arsenal was stored. I remember this
causing some tension, especially as later <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_North">Oliver
North</a> appeared on one of the
channels suggesting Fort Detrick was the target for the fourth plane
(although I believe this was later disproved). I later walked to the
front gates of the fort and nothing could be seen other than bush.</p>

<p>Chris and Katrina started calling and emailing people to let them know
they were fine. Katrina asked if I wanted to let people back in Perth
know I was ok. I was focused on what was happening and said they all
knew I wouldn’t be in New York until Wednesday, but Katrina suggested I
might like to let them know anyway. So I emailed everyone. I also tried
calling Skot and Tara - the friends I planned to stay with in NY. It
took some time to get through to them. Communication was understandably
difficult. Mobile phone connections were rare. They eventually emailed
to say they were fine, but their apartment (very close to the World
Trade Center) was inside the exclusion zone and they would be staying
with friends for the next few days. In the end they never stayed another
night in that apartment. It was days before they could re-enter it, and
then only to collect their stuff - they rented a place in Brooklyn
instead. By then the airspace had been closed and trains cancelled - it
was clear I would not be going to NY. Indeed by the end of that day it
felt as if the world was at war - the TV news helped promote this
perception.</p>

<p>The following days were spent watching the news, wandering around
Frederick and imposing on Katrina and Chris’ extended hospitality. A few
events stand out from this time. I remember passing what looked like a
fire station and there being a small armoured vehicle outside and a
group of people with flack jackets and assault rifles on the driveway -
it was a little intimidating. For days after the attack airspace was
closed to commercial flights. However, there were many helicopters
flying overhead. They were all heading to or from Fort Detrick and
looked military. Sometimes there were a couple of dual rotor helicopters
with escorts of smaller war-like helicopters. I remember playing
volleyball with some of Chris’ workmates a few days later and a plane
going overhead. We all stopped and just watched it draw a contrail
across the sky. Afterwards we went to the pub and when I said I was from
Australia (the same as Chris) they replied “are you with us?” At first I
thought they were kidding, but they were very serious. I assured them
Australia would support the US (as it did) and they went back to their
drinks. Patriotism was highly visible. US flags proliferated on the
streets. Most houses had a flag outside, as the picture taken round the
corner from where I was staying shows.</p>

<p>I never did make it to New York. Instead I spent a week in Boston and
then caught the bus from there direct to my outbound flight at JFK
airport. I passed through the city and had 10 minutes interchange at the
bus station near 42nd street. I took one photo.</p>
