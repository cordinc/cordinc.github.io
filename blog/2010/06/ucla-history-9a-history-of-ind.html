<p><strong>Update: This podcast no longer appears to be available online.</strong></p>

<p>Available at <a href="http://www.oid.ucla.edu/webcasts/courses/2009-2010/2009fall/hist9a-1">the course
website</a>.</p>

<p>Finding podcasts on ancient history which do not focus on Mediterranean
civilisations is very hard. The only one I have found so far is
<a href="http://www.ucla.edu/">UCLA’s</a> History 9A - History of India course.
This is a recording of the lectures given as part of the university
course by <a href="http://www.history.ucla.edu/people/faculty?lid=51">Vinay Lal</a>
at the end of 2009. However, the course encompasses far more than the
ancient history for which I was searching. Starting with the first
civilisations, it races through history to end with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_independence_movement">Indian
Independence</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India">Partition</a>.</p>

<p>This course is not available on iTunes but there is a course website
with the lectures in both MP3 audio-only and video in real player
format. Unfortunately, two of the lectures were not recorded. The 27
recorded lectures are around 50 minutes in length and 24MB (for the
MP3s, I didn’t watch the videos). As is normal with recorded lectures
there is some class discussion taking up the first few minutes of each
podcast. The course reading is also available from the <a href="http://classes.sscnet.ucla.edu/course/view/09F-HIST9A-1?topic=-1">class
website</a>.
Professor Lal occasionally mentions visual aids, but video is available.
Production quality is otherwise fine and the material is presented in an
interesting manner.</p>

<p>The podcasts start with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilization">Indus Valley
Civilisation</a>
(in what is modern Pakistan), one of the three early human civilisations
along with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_egypt">Egypt</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia">Mesopotamia</a>). These people
were replaced by the Aryans (no relation to the Nazi Aryans) in some
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryan_invasion_theory">disputed manner</a>.
From there the course quickly skips to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism">Hindu</a> religion and culture,
telling Indian history through Hindu texts. I imagine a similar history
of Europe could be told through early Christian texts, but it would miss
much. In Europe, there were many non-religious texts; the lectures
suggest that in comparison, Hindu texts are the main primary sources for
ancient Indian history.</p>

<p>In any case the lectures on Hinduism are quite interesting if you don’t
already know much about the religion. The course covers the content of
the main <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_scriptures">Hindu texts</a>
from the Vedas, Upanishads, the Bhagavad Gita, the Puranas and a little
on the Bhakti poets. It is intriguing to see how some Hindu concepts
such as Karma or Yoga have been transformed in western culture. Yoga is
a much larger concept then physical exercise and describes many methods
of achieving the goals of life. The Hindu gods also have many avatars -
incarnations or personifications of aspects of the god. One of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar#Avatars_of_Vishnu">avatars of the main god
Vishnu</a> is Buddha - this avatar appeared at a time when Buddhism was expanding in India.
The lectures also detail the basic beliefs of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism">Jainism</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikhism">Sikhism</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism">Buddhism</a> (including a
discussion on its disappearance from India) - all of which have their
origins in India.</p>

<p>After the arrival of Islam towards the end of the first millennium AD,
the course returns to a more traditional history format. As there is
still a thousand years to the present day, the coverage of events can be
succinct. Starting with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delhi_Sultanate">Delhi
Sultanate</a>, Muslim rule of
India continued with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire">Mughal Empire</a>, which succumbed to the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company">East India Company</a>.
It seems strange to have a country ruled by a foreign company and
Professor Lal spends some time detailing how this occurred. The
subsequent rule (and sometimes, misrule) of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Raj">British
Empire</a> is covered, with the
final lecture detailing
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohandas_Karamchand_Gandhi">Gandhi</a> and
his policy of nonviolent civil disobedience leading to independence.</p>

<p>Not knowing much about Indian history other than the basics, I can’t say
I learnt a huge amount more through this podcast, although there are
occasional worthwhile tidbits. However, I did learn a huge amount about
Hinduism. It covers all Indian history in an introductory sweep.</p>
