<p><strong>Possible Spoilers Below</strong></p>

<p>Last night I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hurt_Locker">Hurt
Locker</a> for the first
time. I was looking forward to it. I had heard so many reviews and it
had won 6 Oscars. However, to put it politely, I didn’t like it. I
consider it well below average. Both the major and minor characters are
unbelievable and fit neatly into standard movie stereotypes (“he’s a
maverick, doing dangerous things - but he gets results!”). The scenarios
in which the characters find themselves seem unlikely. One character
carjacks a local and travels across Baghdad, then runs back to the base.
At another point, 3 characters search for enemy bombers in the
backstreets by themselves and unknown to their support. Coming to a
three-way junction, they split up! The script is often heavy-handed,
letting the audience know exactly what they are supposed to be thinking.
For instance, when confronted with a possibly involuntary suicide
bomber, the interpreter repeatedly reminds us “he’s a good guy”. Once is
required, maybe twice to stress the point. However, the many repetitions
beyond that are just clunky. At once crucial point we are told “he has 4
children”. Are we perhaps supposed to empathise with him?</p>

<p>The plot is quite episodic. This got me thinking. It might be that the
story’s ambition was neutered by making it a movie in the first place.
The story has potential and maybe many of its problems (heavy
handedness, stock characters) could be solved by taking longer to tell
it - much longer. It is very hard to fit a complete interesting story
with detailed real characters into the 2 hour timeframe of a film. I
doubt even extending the running length to 3 hours, the extreme end of
theatrical releases, would give enough room to properly tell Hurt
Locker’s story. Perhaps it should be a TV series.</p>

<p>I remember a time not long ago when the 4 or 6 hours of a mini-series
were the longest storylines around. Now there have been quite a few TV
series with continuous storylines. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon_5">Babylon 5</a> was the first I remember, but
since then there have been the excellent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wire">The
Wire</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sopranos">The
Sopranos</a> among many others.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Kill">Generation Kill</a> told a
similar story to Hurt Locker more successfully over 7 hours. After
watching these, other TV shows with their “everything resolved in 40
minutes” episodes seem inferior (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Who">Dr
Who</a> is suffering from this at
the moment). I am not suggesting film is inferior in general, just that
it has its limits and most of the best films don’t try to do too much.
For great characters and great stories the extra time afforded by TV
pays great dividends.</p>
