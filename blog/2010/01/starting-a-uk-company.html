<h4>Starting a UK Company</h4>

<p>Having just completed the process of forming a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_company">limited company
under UK law</a>, I found
myself frustrated by the number of steps required. In case I ever need
to do it again, or a reader does, I thought it might be useful to set
out the steps I took - hopefully I haven’t missed any! If it seems
overwhelming, various accountancy or specialist firms can do most of it
for a fee. Note, I am not an expert in this area, just someone who has
done it once and recorded the steps - there is no guarantee this is
completely correct.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First get the company formed. This will require a unique company
name, a business address, and directors’ details. Forming the
company can be done through <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies
House</a>, but I used <a href="http://www.companiesmadesimple.com">Companies
Made Simple</a> to get things
moving quickly. I recommend getting a Printed Certificate of
Incorporation - it is needed in later steps.</li>
  <li>In my business, clients require invoices to have a VAT number so
registering for VAT was my next step. If you don’t need a VAT number
straight away, you may wish to get a bank account first. Also, if
the firm’s turnover is less than £68,000, registration is not
required. There are a few other exemptions too, see more at the
<a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=m&amp;r.l4=1073863071&amp;r.l1=1073858808&amp;r.lc=en&amp;r.l3=1083126677&amp;r.l2=1083126673&amp;topicId=1083126677&amp;r.i=1077722988&amp;r.t=BLTTOOL">Business Link VAT
guide</a>.
I applied for registration online through the <a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC Online
website</a> (click register) - the details
required should be the same as for company formation. HMRC also runs
a <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/vat/start/schemes/flat-rate.htm">Flat Rate VAT
scheme</a> that
is worth investigating. If it turns out to be useful then applying
to join the scheme can be done at the same time as registering for
VAT.</li>
  <li>Get a bank account. This is quite important as many of the other
steps need either bank details or a good reason why there are none
(eg VAT registration). Most banks will require a Printed Certificate
of Incorporation. I can’t recommend any good banks, and you should
be aware that it can take longer than you think to open a business
account.</li>
  <li>Sign up to file company documents online at <a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/">Companies
House</a> (click on File documents
online). Even if the information given during formation never
change, the company will still need to submit at least two forms a
year to Companies House to stay registered (annual return and annual
accounts). This is easy to do online. At the same time you can sign
up for the
<a href="http://www.companieshouse.gov.uk/infoAndGuide/coIdFraud.shtml">PROOF</a>
system to make it harder for fraudsters to take control of the
company by filing paper forms. However, be aware that once you have
applied for online access, Companies House will (physically) mail
some activation forms before you can file online.</li>
  <li>If the company will be paying anyone a salary or expenses
(directors’ expenses count) then you will need to sign up to PAYE.
This can be done up to a month before payment. Again this can be
done through the <a href="https://online.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC website</a> (click
register). From the employer’s perspective, I find PAYE a bit
complicated. You should learn about it yourself -
<a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/intro/index.htm">HMRC</a> and <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=m&amp;r.l1=1073858808&amp;r.lc=en&amp;topicId=1073858787">Business
Link</a>
are good places to start.</li>
  <li>In the weeks after forming the company, HMRC should send you some
forms to register for Corporate Tax. These need to be filled in and
returned within 3 months of business activity starting. Filling in
the forms will require the firm’s PAYE, VAT details, and the
Memorandum of Incorporation (this should have been included as part
of the formation process).</li>
  <li>Insurance may be required and is probably a good idea anyway. My
business area requires Professional Indemnity Insurance, so I
organised this before beginning trading. There are many other forms
of insurance which may be useful - my firm also has Employers’
Insurance and Public Liability Insurance. <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/layer?r.s=sl&amp;r.lc=en&amp;topicId=1075196424">Business Link have a
guide</a>
to help determine which forms of insurance may be required. I used
an industry specialist insurer, which wouldn’t be useful to most
readers, but I have learnt to shop around as different firms can
quote vastly different rates (often the most expensive is multiples
of the cheapest).</li>
  <li>I recommend signing up to submit VAT, PAYE and Corporate Tax forms
through the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC website</a>. It is quite
good and normally guides you through the process of completing a
form; facing a long paper form fills me with fear. Also, if VAT is
paid by direct debit (which can be set up online) HMRC will give you
an extra week to pay (this can be done for PAYE too). After
initially applying online HMRC will send activation codes through
the mail to complete the process.</li>
  <li>Profit!</li>
</ul>

<p>After that I advise you quickly sort out your accounts and construct a
calendar of regulatory/tax events. Remember, every 3 months a VAT form
will need to be submitted. Depending on payroll size, PAYE will need to
be paid monthly or once a year in addition to an annual PAYE form (P35)
and expenses form (P11D). Corporate Tax forms need to be submitted
annually, as do Companies House returns and accounts. Staying organised
and being able to quickly determine the financial position of the firm
is very useful. Since my business is fairly simple and having completed
a course on accounting at uni, I created a double entry book-keeping
system in Excel. If you don’t feel you have the knowledge to do this (or
the firm’s accounts are too complicated) there are various software
packages and accountants that can help - I can’t recommend any.</p>

<p>In general, the <a href="http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/">HMRC</a> and <a href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk">Business
Link</a> websites are very useful and well
worth a look.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
