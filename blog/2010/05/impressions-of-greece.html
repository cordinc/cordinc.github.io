<p>Greece is collapsing. So says the media. The news regularly shows riots
in Athens; the papers discuss the dire economic straits. A person here
in London could easily form the view the precipice is near.</p>

<p>Having spent a week in Athens last month, I didn’t leave with the
impression disaster was imminent. People generally seemed to be going
about their daily business. There were no clear signs of distress (apart
from one incongruity). Indeed, other cities I have visited appeared to
be in worse situations. While a large amount of my time was spent in
busy tourist throngs around the archealogical sites, I also travelled
out into the surrounding areas. What I saw appeared to be a working
city. There were numerous storefronts with decent traffic and many
business offices. The streets became busier after work hours. Bars and
resturants were quiet during the day, but became busy late in the night.
At one point we saw a crowd blocking a street near Syntagma, it could
have been a well behaved protest, or just as easily people waiting for
some celebrity. There was a lot of graffiti, but also a lot of graffiti
art. Not so different to London really and there was probably about the
same number of unused/abandoned buildings. Although unlike London, many
of the occupied buildings appeared quite run-down and not well
maintained.</p>

<p>There was one indication of possible problems. On a quiet side street
North-East of Omonoia we walked past trees, parked cars, buildings that
looked like apartment blocks, and little shops. Then there were two
burnt out cars next to each other. They were completely wrecked - the
fire destroyed everything. However, there was no damage apart from the
cars. Either the fire was somewhere else and then the wrecks dumped
there or the immediately surrounding area was cleaned up (but the cars
left). Both seem strange. Apart from these wrecks, Athens did not feel
different to most cities I have visited.</p>

<p>Cities are ususally places of vibrant activity - normally business
related. Visit London, Paris, Sydney, Barcelona or Milan and you feel
you are in a working city. There is the sense that the locals are busy
getting things done. Travelling around London, I am constantly amazed by
the number and variety of business nameplates outside buildings. You can
walk for hours from Shoreditch across to Hammersmith and it is busy
offices the entire way. Washington and Rome feel more dominated by
tourism and government, but there is still lots happening around you.
Two places I feel didn’t match this description, at the time I visited,
are Lisbon and Tunis. There was a general lack of activity in Lisbon, it
seemed almost empty. Never have I seen so many empty, decrepit
buildings. Tunis was similar, full of people, but they didn’t seem to be
doing much. There was always a large number of men sitting in cafes,
presumably un- or underemployed. These two cities felt like they were in
dire economic straits. Indeed, Portugal is currently mentioned in
similar financial terms to Greece, but that situation was clearer on the
streets of Lisbon than Athens.</p>
