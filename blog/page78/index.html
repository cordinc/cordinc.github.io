    <p>On Saturday I played a round of golf at the <a href="http://www.clgc.co.uk/">Central London Golf
Centre</a>. The allure of this place is that it is
the nearest golf course to me in South London. They also have a driving
range, but I didn’t use this. Parking is available and there were quite
a few spaces empty on the weekend I went. Nearest train station is
Earlsfield, about 15-20 minutes walk away. Booking is required for
weekends, but tee time was fairly flexible. We arrived late but still
started when ready. It cost £20 for 9 holes and club hire (cheaper on
weekdays) - very reasonable. The hired clubs were only a random
half-set, but between the two of us we had everything except a 3 wood,
so we shared. If you need to hire and can’t share clubs with your group,
then check what you are given carefully.</p>

<p>It is a par 31, 9-hole course totalling 2,332 yards. Much of the detail
I saw online spoke of an 18-hole course, but this involves playing each
hole twice. There are four par 4’s and the rest are par 3. It is a very
straight course, the flag is clearly visible from the tee on all holes.
Only on the 9th is there any impediment to a straight driver - a small
lake. The holes are fairly tightly packed and we often encountered
players on other holes playing across ours (and did the same a few times
ourselves). It is a friendly course, good for beginners or a quick no
stress round. If I lived nearer I’d definitely consider a membership,
but my friend pointed out that it might get a little boring after
regular play.</p>

<p>One caveat though, the food at the clubhouse is awful. Walk into
Earlsfield if you want something to eat.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Previously I wrote about big companies not using Ruby, Scala or similar
new languages because they are not mature enough, adding that this
probably wouldn’t apply in small companies. This implies an underlying
assumption - that big and small companies are different. This might be
obvious to most readers, but based on my experience it isn’t to many
people I see working in software. Much of the software development
advice around is only useful for one type of organisation, although
people get hung up on trying to apply it to everyone.</p>

<p>To me, as far as a software team is concerned, a big company is one
where there is a sizeable layer of bureaucracy. This can manifest as a
large number of political players, passive stakeholders who can greatly
change requirements, seemingly arbitrary requirements, or just filling
in forms and otherwise jumping through hoops. This is not to say that
all of this is unnecessary - some degree of bureaucracy is required to
stop developers going off on complete flights of fancy. Also government
regulation often requires development to follow a set path; a developer
doing their own thing could unknowingly expose the company to sanctions
or lawsuits. There seems to be a correlation between the traditional
measures of a big firm and bureaucracy (employees and revenues), but
they don’t always align. I have worked for a very profitable 50K+
employee firm and been allowed to do largely as I wished. While at a 50
person startup in a highly regulated (and litigious!) domain, I was
drowned in paperwork.</p>

<p>Each system has its own advantages &amp; disadvantages. Personally I prefer
working in smaller companies, or at least in parts of large companies
that have more of a small company feel. However, far more developers
work under big firm conditions, and I have met good developers who
prefer the system. So when I read about <a href="http://steveblank.com/2009/04/22/killing-innovation-with-corner-cases/">avoiding corner
cases</a>
I think “yeah, lets get things done”, but at the same time realise this
might not work in an IT department of a large commercial bank. I can
also empathise with <a href="http://www.se-radio.net/podcast/2009-04/episode-132-top-10-architecture-mistakes-eoin-woods">Eoin
Woods</a>
about how a Software Architect needs to be able to find and involve all
the stakeholders of a project, especially the hidden, passive ones that
can stop a project right before it goes into production - a lesson I
learnt the hard way. Although, most small firms wouldn’t even need a
Software Architect. Obviously the context of the advice is crucial.</p>

<p>Some of the best advice I ever received in software development was
while working at a small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Rational_Unified_Process">Rational Unified
Process</a>
consultancy in the late 90’s. The RUP is a large and detailed beast
often favoured by large companies, although the consultancy successfully
applied it to many clients large and small. This was done by never
straying from the spirit of the process, but very regularly deviating
from the written word of the process. I remember one of the owners there
telling me the first step of the RUP on a project was to work out which
bits of it you should throw out as unnecessary (the implication being
that most of it would be bypassed).</p>

<p>Basically, there is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet">no silver
bullet</a>. Advice is just
that, advice. Think about how the advice fits your situation - what are
the premises, and don’t just blindly follow it. I think software
projects work best where they are done by people who look to understand
their environment and can adapt - not just retrying the same old thing
that worked last time (for you or someone else).</p>

    <p>I recently needed to write a Combinatorial Iterator for a project I’m
working on. That is a class which when given a size and a collection of
items (normally a set), returns all the possible unique combinations of
elements from the collection of the given size. For instance the
combinations of size 3 of the set [1,2,3,4] are [1,2,3], [1,2,4],
[1,3,4] and [2,3,4]. There is a nice <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/127704/algorithm-to-return-all-combinations-of-k-elements-from-n">discussion of this problem on
StackOverflow</a>.
The number of possible combinations can explode in size quickly, there
are 2,598,960 combinations of five cards from a standard pack of 52
cards. Thus I wanted to handle each combination in turn as required,
rather than calculate all combinations upfront. Having recently started
learning Scala and Ruby, I decided to implement my solution in those
languages, plus Java (which I use every day at work).</p>

    <p><strong>Deux because they’re fancy!</strong></p>

<p>Starting with the best, <a href="http://www.pied-a-terre.co.uk/">Pied a Terre</a>
is a small, intimate restaurant in Fitzrovia. At least I think it is
small. It appears to be a converted house, so there are many small
rooms. We were in the front room with four tables, most of which were
empty during our meal, and none were in our eyeline. The large front
window was frosted to just above head height. The room felt light, but
no one on the street could see in, nor could we be distracted. Combined
with the staff materialising as if from nowhere whenever required, the
impression was a private dining experience. It is the effect
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/05/fancy-restaurants.html">Hakkasan</a>
was attempting and failing to achieve (there I felt as if I was on a
stage with down lighting trying to isolate our table in a large room).
We ordered the tasting menu with the discovery wines option. Were I to
describe each dish it would become a bore of hyperbole. It is safe to
say the food was incredible, sometime surprisingly so. I’m not normally
a fan of raw tuna, but here the flavour was exquisite. The wine was of a
high standard with two outstanding exceptions and another disappointing
exception (which turned out to be from my home town). Although with 8
glasses over 10 courses it was too much and we had to leave nearly half.
The staff were friendly but to the point and never instrusive. Overall,
the meal was verging on perfection. The main negative point was the
expense - oh my lord the expense. It is by far the most expensive meal
I’ve ever had by a long way. About 50% more expensive than Hakkasan,
which I thought was expensive. For the cost of this meal for two, you
could feed eleven at The Sportsman. Having said that, I’m glad to have
been once, just not sure I could justify another visit before I win the
Lotto jackpot. If this is what two Michelin stars is like, how much
better can three be?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.babur.info/website/index.php">Babur</a> is an Indian
restuaurant in Forest Hill (about 15 minutes walk from where I live)
which recently won an award. I thought it was the “Best Cheap Eat in
South London”, but I’m told that’s not right, and if it is correct then
it must only just qualify on the price criteria (to my mind it’s at the
high end of cheap - £60 for two, with beer but no wine or dessert).
Their takeaway menu is very good so we went for a sitdown meal. The food
was excellent. I had the ostrich starter with tandoori jumbo prawns (the
largest prawns I have seen in Britain), it was mouthwatering and
satisfying in the way good curry can be. Based on the food alone, this
would be one of my favourites. However, I found the service a little
lacking. Our naan was forgotten, but when pointed out it was removed
from the bill with no hassle. Also they tried to sell us a loyalty card
a little too strongly. At first I was interested, but after a quick
calculation realised it wouldn’t be much use to us. We politely refused.
So far no problem. However, they then proceeded to try selling it to us
a further two times, each time explaining to us the “benefits” in full
as if we hadn’t grasped the system the first time. I wasn’t impressed.
Overall, despite the hassle it’s worth a visit.</p>

    <p>I wanted a project to allow attachments to be added to tasks. My
requirements were that: users should be able to add multiple attachments
to a task up to some maximum limit; there should be validation on the
size of the attachments (combined with the number limit this should
ensure I don’t run out of disk space too fast); and, that there should
be some security on downloading a task’s attachments.
<a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip/">Paperclip</a> seems to be
the popular Rails attachment at the moment and is still under active
development, so I hoped to use that. However, it does not handle
multiple attachments for a model. There is a plugin
<a href="http://github.com/heavysixer/paperclippolymorph/tree/master">PaperclipPolymorph</a>
which adds multiple attachments to Paperclip, but I just couldn’t get it
to meet my validation and security requirements. In the end I wrote my
own solution and this article details it.</p>
