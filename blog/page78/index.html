    <p>Last year I started this by stating I wanted to write a system, put it
up online and create a startup around it. Well, 2 out of 3 isn’t bad.
I’d still like to create a product business, but I’m fairly happy I got
Queuesaurus up and running. I partially attribute this result to
publishing the goal So I thought I’d write a new list.</p>

<p>Achievable goals (I hope to manage most of these):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improve Ruby skills to general professional standard (at present I
know it just well enough to do what I want), particularly:
    <ul>
      <li>Gemify BBC weather component and put it on
<a href="http://github.com/">github</a></li>
      <li>Continue working on <a href="http://www.queuesaurus.com">Queuesaurus</a>
issue list (now kept on queuesaurus - viva dogfooding!)</li>
      <li>Start next web project</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Learn <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> to point of being able to
rewrite one of my old abandoned libraries in it</li>
  <li>Learn <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a> to point of being able to
recreate simple ancient historical architectural scenes (no need for
animation or people)</li>
  <li>Decrease net ownership of physical goods</li>
  <li>Blog at an average rate of at least 4 times a month</li>
  <li>Run 5km in 25 minutes</li>
</ul>

<p>Stretch goals (I’m unlikely to manage any of these without significantly
more spare time):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get the <a href="http://www.cordinc.info/weather">weather app</a> to a standard
where I would be happy to open source it (no one would use it, but
it could show what I can do)</li>
  <li>learn Blender and gaming libraries enough to create simplistic
graphical MMOs</li>
  <li>Restart abandoned libraries (graph data type, yafal, music library
analyser)</li>
  <li>Play poker profitably</li>
  <li>Make enough money from non-consulting activities to cover costs</li>
</ul>

    <p>I have completed another 50 online HU poker SnGs. At least I am
consistent - I won 26, the same as the last 50. Again, despite winning
more games than I lose, I have less money than when I started due to
fees (27.5 games is the breakeven point). Also like the previous 50s, I
experienced great runs. I won 14 of the first 18 games. Which of course
means that I won only 12 of the last 32. Urrrgh. I have read that the
variance in HU SnGs is higher than other kinds of poker, but results
like that still really knock your confidence. Worst of all I kept some
stats and discovered the average game runs around 15 minutes. That
quickly adds up and is preventing me doing other things.</p>

<p>I’ve decided to take this poker thing a little less seriously. I’m not
going to quit, but neither am I going to keep track of results and
actively try to play more. I still have some money in my online account,
and will play with that if I feel like it. However, I don’t think I have
the time to continue playing at a rate high enough to get much better
right now. Just standing still for a while will be good enough. I’m not
yet sure what I will do if I run my account down to 0. So for the
foreseeable future there will be no more online poker updates.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>A few years ago I had the idea of creating a fairly standard online
spaceship combat game (like <a href="http://www.eveonline.com">EVE</a>). The
difference to other such games being that the players would not control
their ships directly, but instead through code they submitted to the
game - a more complicated and extended
<a href="http://robocode.sourceforge.net/">Robocode</a> or
<a href="http://www.corewars.org/">CoreWar</a>. At the time I stopped because I
couldn’t work out a way of preventing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack">Denial of service
attacks</a> in the
submitted code. I had hoped to use Java as it had an extensive security
model, but I found there was no way of stopping untrusted code from
starting too many threads or allocating too much memory.</p>

<p>Fast forward many years, and I thought I’d check out if the situation
has improved. A search on Google returned all the same webpages I read 9
years ago - there hasn’t been much movement in the area. The Javadocs
suggested that the thread issue had been fixed, but no word about
memory. I checked Robocode and it seems to just ignore the memory
allocation problem. This is because it is not fixed!</p>

<p>WTF! Sun has gone on about the <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/Security/whitepaper/JS_White_Paper.pdf">Java Security
Model</a>
for some time now. Touting the safety of its sandbox. However, if
untrusted code can crash the system it is broken - nothing more to say.
I don’t care about the rest. This has been a known issue for years.</p>

<p>Anyway, rant over. On a more positive side, I used
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> for the first time in
researching this issue and it is quite cool. My question is
<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/540738/excessive-memory-allocation-in-java-sandbox-security">here</a>.
The answer states that there is a <a href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=284">movement to fix the memory DoS
attack</a>, but that it is still in
the requirements stage and <a href="http://tech.puredanger.com/java7/">probably will not be part of
Java7</a>.</p>

    <p>Urgh, overconfidence is a killer. I have now completed the 50 online $2+0.20 heads-up tournaments I <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/11/how-to-make-1hour-playing-onli.html">previously
mentioned</a>.
You may remember my goal was to win 70. Well, I didn’t make it. The good
news is I won more than I lost - 52. The bad news is that with entrance
fees, a win rate of 55% is required to break even. I lost $6 and so
ended up with $66; a little disappointing.</p>

<p>It all started so badly. I’d like to think it was just variance - that
the luck of the cards means that sometimes you are just going to lose.
However, reading that goal-setting blog post and remembering those first
few games, I think I might have been overconfident. I improved a little
over time. If I played the first 25 like the second 25, then I would
have made a small profit, but still a long way from the 70% goal.</p>

<p>Like my first posting, I think the main problem is my attitude. While
playing this 50 I kept a record of whether I considered I played “well”
or “badly”, together with the final result. My definition of playing
badly included: not starting in an appropriate frame of mind; getting
disheartened during the match; chasing pots; or bluffing too much even
when the other player was betting back. Those are my main vices. Just
today I played a match where after I ground the other player down for 10
minutes, I went all in on the turn with a full house and then lost on a
2-outer as they made a slightly better full house on the river! Despite
still having a playable stack (around 30BB), I was tilted and busted
stupidly a few hands later. That was badly played. Playing well meant I
played mostly calmly the entire match, allowing a few small bad hands as
long as they were non-terminal. Notably, the maths of poker did not
count for much in categorisation. If both players went all in pre-flop
after just a few hands (a surprisingly common experience), then it was
considered well played if I was ahead at the start (the normal
situation). One game defied categorisation as the other player
disappeared after 2 hands and had to be blinded out. Thus there were 49
entries.</p>

<p>I played well 59% of the time. When playing well I won 72% of the time.
When playing badly I won only 20% of the time. Even allowing a bias
towards saying I played well if I won and badly if I lost, that is still
a big difference. Playing badly 40% of the time is way too high. If I
played well every match, as I should, then I would be close to my
original goal. So the goal for the next 50 is to win 30 (60), by playing
well 80 of the time. To that end, here is my beginner’s advice (from a
beginner to a beginner), which I will try to follow over the next 50:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Decide before starting how many matches you want to play - many
times the “just one more” game was a bad loss.</li>
  <li>Only play if you want to win and can play for the 30 minutes or more
it can take.</li>
  <li>Don’t chase pots, especially if your opponent is betting back.</li>
  <li>Think about what your opponent has - remember 50% of the time they
have a better pre-flop hand.</li>
  <li>Start tight with small bets until you get an idea of your opponent.
If they are tight don’t bluff too much when they bet back (beware
even if they are loose and aggressive). However, be aware people’s
style changes with stack size.</li>
  <li>If you play a hand badly, don’t dwell on it, but do think about
these guidelines.</li>
  <li>If you lose badly, stop.</li>
</ul>
