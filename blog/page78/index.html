  <div class="content">
    <p>For a recent project I had to connect to two different read-only web
services. Both were from commercial vendors providing very similar
information (which I aggregated). One API was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer">REST</a>
based the other used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a>. The REST
interface took me a few hours to write, the SOAP one took days!</p>

<p>For the REST interface I had to send requests to a URL that somewhat
indicated what I was attempting to do - eg
http://example.site/contracts/123 to get the details of contract with id 123. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> was returned and using a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_API_for_XML">SAX</a> parser
constructed my internal objects. In total it took 340 lines of my code
to handle the entire web service. Easy!</p>

<p>Using the SOAP interface required me to download their
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Services_Description_Language">WSDL</a>
and then construct a model of their domain objects - I used <a href="http://ws.apache.org/axis2/">Apache
Axis2</a> (not Apache Axis though, that is an
old and unmaintained project that does the same thing - a confusion that
cost me some time). Unfortunately the WSDL was wrong and the model
didn’t generate properly. I had to dive into the 2000 line WSDL file to
find and fix the error - and it was near unreadable! Try looking at a
commercial WSDL file some time. After some trial and error the model was
right and when surrounded by copious error handling code it could be
sent and data received from the service. It took 810 lines of my code,
plus hundreds more in the generated model. Urgh. At this point one might
suggest it was just a problem caused by a dodgy service provider.
However, I have since added a third read-only web service to the
project. It is also SOAP based and just as difficult to get running
properly - apart from having to modify the WSDL since theirs was correct
from the start.</p>

<p>I also have experience from the other side, providing a web service.
Using <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> I added a REST interface
to my existing website by just providing XML views of the data. While
working at a bank a SOAP interface to an existing legacy system was
required, it took a great deal of fiddling and trust in our IBM
development tools to get it working after a couple of days.</p>

<p>The experience reminds me of an <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/04/29/oreilly_amazon/">interview on The
Register</a> where
Tim O’Reilly suggests that SOAP is a standards first specification
created without reference to how it would be used in the real world
(because at the time the spec was created there weren’t any people using
it). SOAP definitely feels like an overengineered solution. The kind of
thing I would have loved earlier in my career when suffering from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second-system_effect">Second System
Syndrome</a>. Over time
I am becoming increasingly appreciative of simplicity in code.</p>

<p>For me, there is now no comparison. SOAP just doesn’t seem to work well
in any place I’ve seen it tried. My first choice for web service API
will have to be REST.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>This week I met up with some old colleagues. While talking about what we
were all doing now, one person who still worked at the place we worked
together mentioned that there had been a change in software
architecture. Thus all my old code would be rewritten. This news got me
thinking. I’ve been writing software commercially for nearly 12 years
and most of my code is no longer used. Three years of work is gone due
to my employers going bust. Another 3 and a half years worth was (or
will be) rewritten after changes in platform architecture. Two more
years of work was retired after completing the purpose for which it was
written. One employer from years ago still uses 2 years of coding work -
just last month I crossed paths with one of the users who did acceptance
testing (he remembered me after 5 years, although neither of us could
remember the other’s name) and he said they were still very happy with
it. So about 70% of my work, measured by time, is gone and no longer of
any use. Is that normal?</p>

<p>I’m not sure what is the appropriate comparison. Engineers and
architects build structures that last for many years. I have known
people who assisted building houses, power stations, and gas pumping
stations. All of which still stand and should for decades to come.
However, these are physical things, so are obviously physically harder
to construct. Creating software is a thought driven logical process.
Perhaps a better comparison is with other professionals dealing with
abstract concepts like accountants, lawyers, analysts, etc. Much of
their output is transactional in nature: calculating this year’s
corporate accounts; writing or checking a contract; or, producing a
report. While such work may exist for some time, its utility drops
greatly once the reason for its creation has passed. I suppose this is
analogous to code still existing in sourcecode repositories long after
it no longer runs. In which case still having 30% of my work useful is
probably a good record.</p>

<p>However, I don’t find the comparison to other abstract workers wholly
compelling. Software developers seem to fall in between them and
engineers. We think abstractly for a living, but produce something, even
if it is just logic, that has utility beyond the point of its creation.
Some computer programs have been running for decades - otherwise there
couldn’t have been such an issue around
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">Y2K</a>. Even in the
faster moving consumer software world code can hang around. Just today I
used a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS">DOS</a> command window - probably
some very old code hanging around there.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best way to think about my profession is that it is a
discipline of engineering which works with logic and thus allows the
perception that its artefacts are easily replaced (even if in reality
that often is not the case). Also it is a fairly new profession and as
such it is developing and changing rapidly, which also encourages code
to be replaced with updated, more modern, versions. As for my record,
when I mentioned the figures to my old colleagues they didn’t think it
was strange or exceptional in any way. That is probably just modern
commercial software development.</p>

    <p>I was recently listening to a <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/audio/2009/jul/21/tech-weekly-podcast-develop-video-games-eidos-braben">podcast from a game developers
conference</a>,
and there was a great deal of conversation around open world games like
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series)">GTA</a>. That
discussion made me think about the difference between a storyline (be it
from a book, movie or game) and the world in which it’s set. When a
story is set somewhere other than the familiar every day world, the
perceived richness of that world can make a big difference to
satisfaction in the story. Think of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings">The Lord of the
Rings</a>, where there
is a strong impression that there is history to Middle-earth (read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion">The
Silmarillion</a> to see that
is exactly the case) and many interesting things are occurring just out
of reach of the plot.</p>

<p>The first two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix_(series)">Matrix</a>
movies are another example. The first Matrix movie was quite linear (as
many prophecy movies tend to be). Neo was led from scene to scene to
fulfil his destiny. The world around Neo was the same as our own except
for two organised opposing groups who knew the secret of the matrix.
There wasn’t much room for manoeuvre. Despite what people thought of the
second Matrix’s plot, its world was far richer. Neo has some choice in
his actions, there are portals or otherwise strange locations and rogue
or independent programs roaming the matrix. It is no longer black versus
white, there are many other actors on the stage.</p>

<p>When I used to run D&amp;D games some advice I was given was to make the
world seem as open as possible, even if you were trying to subtly guide
the players in one direction. The story can be thought of as a train,
starting at the caboose and ending at the engine. A linear story/game
would have the protagonists/players just travel through each carriage in
turn. In a more open environment they may travel by climbing over the
carriage roof or skipping carriages by walking past them at a station or
travel backwards for a bit. In a completely open environment they could
decide not to go to the engine at all, leave the train and do something
else. A world in which that last option appears possible and realistic
is much more interesting, even if the actual story is linear.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>While holidaying in the Orkneys we ate dinner one night at <a href="http://www.thecreel.co.uk/">The
Creel</a>, regarded as one of the best
restaurants in Scotland (according to our guidebook). It also has a long
list of awards (AA rosettes, Good Food Guide and a Scottish Restaurant
Chef of The Year), most of which it displays on its walls. The menu is
quite simple and short - a choice of around four starters, with a
similar number of mains - all skewed heavily towards local seafood.</p>

<p>We had the scallops and a langoustine salad for starters. The scallops
were good (for what they were - I’m not a huge fan of that shellfish),
but the langoustines with orange and a pesto dressing on the salad were
excellent. For mains one of us had hake with squid and aubergine and the
other halibut with mashed cauliflower and peas. The halibut was just
about 30 seconds cooked beyond its best, but the hake was perfect. For
both the accompaniment were particular highlights. However, the one
issue was salt - there was way too much. This is something The Creel has
in common with nearly every restaurant we visited in Scotland, so
perhaps that is just the Scottish style. Still, to my palate it stopped
a very good dish becoming a great dish.</p>

<p>We had no dessert, and the whole meal came to £67 with a couple of
drinks. Very reasonable by London standards and not that much more than
some of the other places we visited while away. The service and decor
were fine. One thing to note though is that it is a small restaurant and
all the tables were taken when we were there on a Tuesday night -
booking is essential. Well worth a visit and I would try it again if in
the area.</p>

<p>As an aside, I would also like to say the lunch I had at the Skara Brae
Tourist Centre was excellent. It may just look like a standard canteen,
but the quality of the food is very high with friendly and helpful
staff. I almost drove back there a second time just for lunch. A hidden
gem, and if you are in Orkney it behoves you to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skara_Brae">Skara
Brae</a> and then eat lunch on
site (or take away).</p>

    <p>I just got back from a fortnight travelling the Scottish north. Despite
comments from workmates, the weather held out for all but the last two
days of the trip. Once again I have put the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157621165945715/show/">best of my photos on
