<h4>Overmarketing</h4>

<p>Last week I sadly experienced another company taking a customer’s goodwill and throwing it away. In this case, not quite (yet) one for the list of <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-of-which-i-am-not-a.html">companies of which I am not a customer</a>, but still an egregious failure.</p>

<p>Coles is my local supermarket, part of a large Australia-wide chain. I am a member of their loyalty rewards program and have been mostly happy with their service over the last two years. They recently started adverting a store credit card through their loyalty program. I happen to be considering getting a credit card (I don’t have one at the moment), and this card met my requirements (most in Australia do not). So I went to to their website to apply.</p>

<p>The first page asked for my name, email and phone number, and detailed the remainder of the process. Reading this page I noticed two things: firstly, that I was missing some necessary documentation; and that upon clicking continue they may use my contact info to follow up the application. I decided to come back the next day with the documents needed. I did not click continue.</p>

<p>Withion a few minutes of closing the webpage I get a text from Coles stating that my application had been saved, and a link to restart it. I thought that a bit cheeky, since I definitely didn’t click continue and they clearly took my details off the page asynchronously. Never mind, I wasn’t particularly upset. However, in the following 24 hours they sent two texts, two emails and TWO phonecalls - all trying to push me into completing the application. Does anyone actually respond positively to this harassment? I certainly don’t. If they are like this before I finish the application, imagine what they would be like after! The last call ended with me stating forcefully (but hopefully politely) “delete all my details and never contact me again”.</p>

<p>While I will likely shop at Coles again, I will never have one of their credit cards. It is also extremely unlikely I will use any of their other non-food offers. I have already turned off all marketing email through the loyalty account. Not that I feel in any way loyal anymore. This week I will be shopping at Woolies.</p>
