<p>Once again I tracked the boardgames I played through the year (similar posts for <a href="/blog/2024/01/boardgames.html">2023</a> &amp; <a href="/blog/2023/02/boardgames.html">2022</a>). Over 2024, I played 31 different games a total of 69 times. A high-water mark I doubt I’ll challenge this year (unless my online boardgame playing really expands). I had an attempt on the 5x5 challenge (playing 5 games 5 times each), but fell a single game short. The full list is below, with the ones I own in <em>italics</em>.</p>

<p>Most of the Battletech games were played at various local clubs. Many of the rest were played at the monthly Strategy Boardgame WA club. Although there are a few from meetups with the WA Boardgame Association and one from the local 18XX aficionados (my unofficial name) meetup. This year I also started playing online - all the games of Nevsky, 18GA and two of the Shikoku 1889 games were played online at <a href="https://www.rally-the-troops.com/">Rally the Troops</a> or <a href="https://18xx.games/">18XX.games</a>. I had previously tried playing online with Vassal and was unimpressed, but these new websites are much better. Also, after having played a few solo games I don’t think they are for me. I find myself taking advantage of the simplicity or lack of creativity of my cardboard opponent in a way that does not translate well to playing against humans. Playing online seems a better option, or playing computer games specifically designed for solo play.</p>

<p>This year I sold two games: 7th Continent (too repetitive and long) and Arkham Horror (not able to get it to the table other than solo). I acquired a bunch of games - a few I purchased, but more as gifts. Only one of these I managed to play during the year: Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients. So there is a replenished list of owned but unplayed games I need to reduce. I am considering selling a few more games as they seem hard to get people to play, so I always forget the rules in the year or two between plays: Falling Sky; High Frontier; and Twilight Struggle. However, I’m leaning towards keeping them at the moment.</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts on some games I played multiple times this year, and haven’t previously reviewed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nevsky</strong>: Brutal and unforgiving wargame set in during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1240_Izborsk_and_Pskov_campaign">Teutonic invasion of Novgorod in the 13th century</a>. This game requires and rewards careful planning of supply lines, equipment and an army’s length of service. Then winter comes and makes it all even harder. Also has an interesting command system so that if your plans go awry, you may have to pass a few turns until resetting. This is a clever game, that feels true to its setting, but I’m not sure it is a fun game for me. I’ll try to give it another go in a few months.</li>
  <li><strong>Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients</strong>: Fast block-based wargame set during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punic_Wars">Punic wars</a>, that has a card-based command system limiting your power to do things. A charge on the left flank may win the game, but if you don’t have a card that allows you to perform that charge then tough luck. Fun.</li>
  <li><strong>Conquest of Paradise</strong>: This is a very interesting and enjoyable game. A fast-playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X">4X</a> set during the polynesian expansion with random island placement. There is a strong emphasis on the first two X’s: explore and expand. The 4th X, extermination, is rare - in the 3 games I played there were only 2 battles, both as the final game winning action. I saw more battles avoided through a dance-off!</li>
  <li><strong>Viticulture</strong>: Eurostyle worker placement game about the winemaking process. I played a few of these this year. This was probably the most enjoyable, but they were all quite similar and fun.</li>
  <li><strong>Falling Sky</strong>: Asymmetric wargame set in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars">Gallic Wars</a>. Long and complicated. It requires a great deal of concentration, which I like, but is corresponding hard to get people to play.</li>
  <li><strong>Shikoku 1889</strong>: A relatively gentle introduction to the generally unforgiving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX">18XX</a> genre. Build railways at the start of the industrial revolution, with the aim of maximising your personal wealth (as opposed to the railway companies’ wealth). These games have some clever tabletop implementation of financial concepts (like companies, IPOs and debt). I will have to try more of these.</li>
  <li><strong>Agricola: ACGAS</strong>: 2-player worker placement game. A smaller version of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a> (which I haven’t played). Very little player interaction, as you build up a small medieval farm. Now we have played a few times it largely always plays out the same way. Fun, but perhaps a little too limited.</li>
  <li><strong>Pax Pamir</strong>: I read the rules before playing this each time, yet still after 2 games I don’t know what is happening during the game. This tableau builder set in the historical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Game">Afghani Great Game</a> seems simple, but that belies quite a bit of depth and strategy. An experienced player easily defeats a newbie. Do I want to put the effort in to be a good player? Not sure.</li>
  <li><strong>El Grande</strong>: I played this at WABA. A very interesting area control/hand management game with some special and hidden actions. After two games I hadn’t worked out a good strategy, at least not against my opponents. I like the initiative deck system where each player choses a unique starting priority (unique both across all players in a round, and across all rounds by a player) - high priority and you start first, but get few resources, or vice versa. I was less keen on the hidden units in the castille, but then I’m not a fan of memory tests. A good game, I’d definitely play again.</li>
  <li><strong>Arkham Horror</strong>: Coop cardgame which attempts to tell a Lovecraftian horror adventure story. I just played the introductory campaign that comes in the box, but many more can be bought as expansions. It is definitely grim and difficult. The game doesn’t care about your success and negative effects (and some positive) persist through the game so failure or compromise seems inevitable. Thus the theme is well captured. I like: that cards are dual use (for points or ability); the chitpull modifier system; and, that the story advances along two sequences (your story and the opponents plan). I like less that the story is fixed, so after playing it once it gets easier as you know what is happening and what to do. This is not as prominent as in 7th Continent, as each mission in Arkham is probably only played a few times and changes completely for a new mission (unlike 7th where most of the cards are the same across curses, so you do them over and over again). Replayability is enhanced by the expansions, but the cost adds up quickly. Still if my usual game group were interested then I would buy and play them, but (being keen on winning and not keen on coop) they are not interested.</li>
