<br/><br/>
<p>At the star of April I spent a fortnight in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> for a wedding. Perhaps half the time was spent on travelling (see below) and the wedding activities, but we managed some sightseeing along the way. Overall it seems like a nice place to visit, although I’m in no rush to go back (despite missing some good stuff like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigiriya">Sigiriya</a>). People have said it is similar to the Bali of 30 years ago. I can see that, it seems to be a good place to relax by the beach. Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are surprisingly few restaurants everywhere we went (except the Negombo tourist strip). We probably only had 3 meals at local eateries, and that took some effort. I thought perhaps they were there, but I wasn’t looking for the right signs. However, I checked with various online maps, then confirmed by talking to locals and other tourists. Apparently Sri Lankans don’t tend to eat out often and tourists spend most of their time at touristy places (so outside those places good luck!).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo">Colombo</a> is jarring mix of run down building and new towers, often very close to eachother.</li>
  <li>You are dangerously gem deficient! Walking around the capital we were regularly approached by initially friendly men who quickly told us that we were lucky to be in town that day as there was a special one-day only sale at the best gem store in town. We must go! This was over many different days and stores. One was a little aggressive, but all eventually accepted we weren’t going anywhere with them.</li>
  <li>Expect to pay more as a non-local, sometimes by a lot. For example, when a taxi wanted more from us than a equivalent Australian taxi (which are not cheap) we tried Uber and got a car at tenth of the asking price.</li>
  <li>Security sometimes can be very tight, other times non-existent. Going into hotels and shopping malls we went through metal detectors and bag checks. However, other places like train stations had no security, often not even a ticket check. There was no visible security on the streets either (although it still felt safe). Presumably this is a holdover from the long finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_civil_war">civil war</a> and more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Sri_Lankan_protests">recent protests</a>.</li>
  <li>The train network is extensive and amazingly cheap, but incredibly slow and often delayed. Don’t be overly concerned about going in the lower classes as long as you have a set seat. We went in reserved 3rd class for one trip - it was fine and was not that much worse than 1st (no A/C, but we had the windows open). Overall we spent two nearly entire days travelling a few hundred kilometers and back again.</li>
  <li>The surrounds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatton,_Sri_Lanka">Hatton</a> are pretty (not so much the town itself), but there is not much else. The main site seems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Peak">Adam’s Peak</a> a sacred site at the top of a mountain and the destination for a lot of internal tourism. It is extremely busy!</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negombo">Negombo</a> has a strip along the beach full of bars, restaurants, hotels, and shops of local arts. It seemed pleasant but definitely tourist focused. We had a very good fish meal there in a restaurant just off the strip on our last night.</li>
  <li>It was hard to find good flights to Sri Lanka. Avoiding budget airlines and overly long flights meant we had two options. Both arrived and departed near midnight. Relatively cheap though.</li>
</ul>
