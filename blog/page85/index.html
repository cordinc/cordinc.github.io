    <p>Alpha testing has not gone as well as I hoped. Over the last few weeks I
have been adding functionality and I thought the system was quite
usable. So as a final step before expanding testing, I sat down with my
first alpha tester to watch them use it. I expected them to suggest
extra features. I had a long list of extra things I could do, but wasn’t
sure which were important. The good news was that they only suggested a
couple of small things that I already had on my list. The bad news is
just watching them use the site made me wince and clearly wasn’t the
best experience for them either. Over the 10 minutes of the test I
quickly filled a couple of pages with issues: what does this mean, what
does that do, why is that there, how do I do that?</p>

<p>I can heartily recommend watching someone removed from development
trying to use your system. After a couple of months I am too close to
the program. I no longer see what is displayed, I just know what needs
to be done. I also know how to move around the site. Seeing the site
through someone else’s eyes was illuminating. Watching them have to move
the mouse all the way across the screen to do two related actions made
me realise I focus exclusively on one bit of functionality at a time.
Seeing them wonder if two similar but unfamiliar terms referred to the
same concept made me realise I don’t read the text. When they suggested
that grey buttons made it look like they we deactivated, I remembered
that I meant to spend some time on the design instead of just working on
functionality. I have decided that I will not add any new functionality
for the next couple of weeks, instead I will focus on fixing up what is
already there.</p>

    <p>Yesterday was the first poker game I organised at my place. I have been
playing poker for a little over a month now, mainly free online games. I
felt it was time to try playing against people. Although I was hoping it
would be more of a social event than a full-blooded competition. For
many years I was put off playing poker due to the “fresh victims”
attitude many experienced players had towards people new to the game. It
didn’t seem like the learning experience would be much fun. I hoped we
would avoid that and think we succeeded.</p>

<p>I sounded out a few friends and invited them around for an afternoon and
evening of tournament style play. In the end there were six of us
playing - Ann, Ian, Ury, Christian, Cristina, and me. A good number
considering the space. Ian and Ury said they had played before, but
everyone else claimed to be a beginner. We played two £5 buy-in
tournaments with the blinds doubling every half-hour and rebuys allowed
for the first hour (although no one used them). I don’t remember many of
the hands, but will attempt a short description of the evening.</p>

<p>In the first game Christian went out first, almost right on the hour
mark, then Ury went, quickly followed by myself. However, Ury was lucky
not to be the first out on a few occasions. Ann’s patented “fold-raise”
tactic put out an unlucky Cristina and bewildered the other players. On
three hands when Ann was the big blind she “folded” before being
reminded checking was free. Then post flop she would raise or call
against Cristina’s all-in. All three times she won with river or turn
cards. The Cristina event was the last appearance of the “fold-raise”,
perhaps due to the laughter and friendly taunts that ensued. Still, we
all left the night with a new poker trick in our arsenal, though I
personally wouldn’t have the audacity to attempt it! Ann assures us it
was just “ditzy play”, but who knows? Ann ended up beating Ian heads-up
as he lost 5 showdowns in a row as the rising blinds forced one or both
all-in pre-flop.</p>

<p>In the second game Ian was out first - although this was just after a
call from his girlfriend inquiring as to his whereabouts. He left soon
after. Then Ury and I went out. At this point the game settled down with
three roughly equal stacks and few big raises. As the blinds rose Ann
tried a few bluffs and got burnt by calls. With a single big blind left
she went all-in a couple of times without looking at her cards, busting
out Christian in the process. Ann and Cristina went heads-up for the
win. Again the rising blinds forced pre-flop all-in play and again,
despite starting the heads-up as the small stack, Ann was the lucky
winner.</p>

<p>Afterwards Ann described her winning tactics as “staying sober and
bamboozling them with ditzy play”. Future opponents beware!</p>

<p>Things I learnt from the evening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Watch out for people staying sober!</li>
  <li>Poker games go longer than expected.</li>
  <li>Having the blinds rise so high that the game finishes with people
being forced to go all-in pre-flop every hand is not a satisfying
end. However, I can’t see a way of forcing an end otherwise.</li>
  <li>Don’t bluff people who always call.</li>
  <li>I won’t remember specific hands later - I should take notes if they
are noteworthy.</li>
  <li>It is fun to play (as long as there is not too much at risk - at
least at my level). I will definitely organise another.</li>
</ul>

<p>If any of the players remember any other good hands other than the ones
I mentioned, feel free to add them in the comments.</p>

    <p>I have recently had occasion to visit a couple Michelin star
restaurants. Together with a previous dinner, I have been to a total of
three restaurants rated one Michelin star (none higher rated). As there
is a bit of buzz at the moment around chefs and restaurants, here are
some brief reviews.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rivercafe.co.uk/">River Cafe</a> - I used to share a flat
around the corner from this place. There were always expensive cars
parked out the front, some with chauffeurs reading a paper in the front
seat. I wanted to see what it was like before leaving London. I had a
crab pasta dish. It was very nice, but I was slightly unimpressed
considering the cost. Nice food, nice wine, it just didn’t grab me.
Although I’d be happy to give it another try sometime.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakkasan">Hakkasan</a> - A subterranean
Chinese restaurant in the west end. The decor was very stylish. The
tables were spotlighted but the paths were in darkness - a cool affect.
The food was very good but my foremost memory of this place is the
service. I found it excessive. The staff were constantly checking on us.
I joked that if I dropped my napkin one of the waiters would catch it
before it hit the floor. Looking around there seemed to be more staff
than diners. Neither I or my partner could relax. I enjoyed the food,
but probably would not go again.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thesportsmanseasalter.co.uk/">The Sportsman</a> - This is a
gastro-pub on the coast at Seasalter near Whitstable. It looks like a
standard pub from the outside. Inside it is light (on an overcast day)
and spacious. The staff were friendly, although they did warn me the
stout had a strong taste, maybe they thought I was a tourist. I had a
crab starter with a lamb main and it was cooked perfectly. In short,
unpretentious atmosphere and excellent food. Most surprising of all, the
cost was about the same as an average London restaurant. Definitely
recommended.</p>

    <p>The last month has been quite a busy one; I went on holiday and work is
keeping me busy. However, I need to keep things going and not let large
time gaps discourage me, so here is an update.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alpha testing going slowly. There are a number of regression bugs
from my occasionally drastic functionality changes and these tend to
stop things for a day or so (I find heroku is too slow to edit
online, so I have to fix it at home and upload). At this point the
Test Driven Development people are probably having a laugh at me and
rightly so. In my defence I am still deciding how various features
should work so there is a great deal of change occurring.</li>
  <li>My design skills are as bad as I thought according to the alpha
tester - this will definitely become a problem later.</li>
  <li>I have taken up golf and poker in the last few weeks and I’m
spending time learning. It’s a great deal of fun, as I seem to have
picked up the basics of both fairly quickly. I aim to write more on
these in future.</li>
  <li>I must find more time to work on my project! I’m also setting a goal
of at least one blog post per week.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve also learnt a bit about web advertising and SEO through this blog.
Up until the Ultrasphinx post very few people visited this blog. Since
that post I get around 5 people a day, with a couple of spikes to 10 in
one day. Most of these people come from google searches (check it out),
only read the ultrasphinx page, and tend not to stay long. However, a
surprising number of them visit again. I have to admit to a little fear
and trepidation when I first saw the explosion (albeit highly targeted)
in readership. I wasn’t sure what to write. Should I write more
technical articles, as that is what drives people to this blog, or just
continue as before. The lack of technical things to write about made the
decision for me, although I do double-check my spelling now.</p>

<p>In any case the extra readership hasn’t made any difference to my ad
clicks or google page rank. Google still classifies cordinc.com as low
popularity. No one has clicked an ad since the first week of the blog,
earning me a grand total of US14cents. I had originally thought that my
project could be funded by ads, but I’m not so sure now. I don’t think
there is as much money in it as before so I may need to rethink the
business model. Perhaps it’s best just to get the system finished first.</p>
