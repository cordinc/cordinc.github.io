  <div class="content">
    <p>While in Cornwall we visited the <a href="http://www.nathan-outlaw.com/">Nathan Outlaw
Restaurant</a> at the St Enodoc Hotel in
Rock (eponymously named for its occasional TV chef). Strangely there are
two Nathan Outlaw restaurants at the hotel: a two Michelin star
restaurant only serving a tasting menu; and a no star al a carte seafood
grill. Preferring choice we booked at the grill.</p>

<p>We first noticed the restaurant was completely empty. Of course a rainy
Monday night at the end of November in Cornwall is about as off-peak as
it is possible to get. Still it was surprisingly to see it was just us
and a single waitress. Needless to say the staff were attentive, but
they were also professional yet friendly. Two hours later when we left,
there were 8 other diners in a place that could easily handle four times
that number.</p>

<p>I had the onion soup for starters - fine but nothing special. My partner
had the largest and most flavoursome mussels I have ever tasted (but I
only got a small taste). We both had the char-grilled
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_robin">Gurnard</a> fillets as our main
course, with crab sauce (as recommended by our waitress). I had never
even heard of this fish before, let alone tasted one. However, I can
proclaim it tasty! The beautifully cooked fillet had a quite solid
texture (for fish) and had a very slight earthy/gamey taste. It went
well with the sauce. Dessert was a delicious chocolate sponge. It all
came to around £130 with a bottle of wine and service charge - not bad
by London standards. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.</p>

<p>Calculating the price of an EGB bond has to be fast. A big bank may have
400 or so European bond obligations and the quotes need to be
recalculated quickly when the market moves. It is possible to recover
from incorrect prices on D2C markets, with their negotiable RFQs.
However, if an executable D2D quote is wrong then the trader will likely
lose money.</p>

    <p>An enforced gap in contracts meant I suddenly had a week free, so time
for a quick extra long weekend to North Cornwall. We stayed in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boscastle">Boscastle</a> and visited various
local towns like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polzeath">Polzeath</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tintagel">Tintagel</a> , with a quick stopoff
at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a> on the way home
(just to say I’ve been). A pleasant trip, although the weather could
have been better. Although when the weather is good, the area is packed
with tourists - for us the place was largely empty. It was a short trip
(with bad light), so only a few photos in the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157628218003357/show/">Flickr slideshow viewable

  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently had a disturbing revelation. A friend and I were talking
about the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita">Lolita</a>, which I
read about 15 years ago. It seemed as if we had read different books.
The broad structure of the plot was the same for both of us, but some
important details were different. Aged 12, their Lolita was
substantially younger than the girl around 15 I remembered. I recalled
Humbert being pathetic and occasionally cruel, but not pathologically
predatory - unlike Quilty. My friend pointed out a number of plot points
I didn’t recollect at all to contradict me. Double checking against the
book demonstrated they were completely right.</p>

<p>Usually I have a very good memory of plots. It was a little concerning
how wrong I was. Then I realised I was remembering the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_(1962_film)">1962 Kubrick
film</a>. In my mind the book had been completely overwritten by the
less confrontational movie (so it could reach a wider audience) and I
had no notion this had occurred. Quilty looked like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellers">Peter
Sellers</a>; Lolita was 14, but
played by an actress that looked older. It is like I never read the book
at all. Has this happened with other memories too - I have no idea.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Since <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/06/tilt.html">last writing about
poker</a> I have fulfilled
my requirement to read a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/12/the-theory-of-poker.html">poker theory
book</a>
twice and started playing again. Not too much, but averaging about 2
Heads-up Sit-n-go games a week (about 20 minutes play per week). I’ll
share my results when I’ve completed a few hundred games and the general
direction I’m heading becomes clear as variance evens out.</p>

<p>At present my results are patchy. I tilt badly less often (but still do
infrequently) and sometimes play quite well. I’m better at recognising
the type of opponent I’m facing and (very) occasionally manage to read a
hand. I’d say 90% of the time I play “ok” for the level of competition
I’m facing (micro stakes). However, I will often play blindingly bad
hands in a match I’m otherwise playing acceptably. Here is an example
where I became enamoured of my top pair against a player who had been
playing very tight for over 15 minutes. What was I thinking, so much had
me beaten.</p>

<p><em>PokerStars No-Limit Hold’em, $1.50 Tournament, 30/60 Blinds (2 handed)
(Converted with http://www.handhistoryconverter.com)</em></p>

<p>Hero (BB) (t1525)<br />
SB (t1475)</p>

<p><b>Preflop</b>: Hero is BB with 3d, Ah<br />
<span style="color:#CC3333">SB bets t120</span>, Hero calls t60</p>

<p><b>Flop</b>: (t240) Ad, 6h, 7s <span style="color:#009B00">(2 players)</span><br />
Hero checks, <span style="color:#CC3333">SB bets t240</span>,
<span style="color:#CC3333">Hero raises to t480</span>, <span style="color:#CC3333">SB
raises to t720</span>, <span style="color:#CC3333">Hero raises to t960</span>,
<span style="color:#CC3333">SB raises to t1355 (All-In)</span>, Hero calls t395</p>

<p><b>Turn</b>: (t2950) Jc <span style="color:#009B00">(2 players, 1 all-in)</span></p>

<p><b>River</b>: (t2950) 4h <span style="color:#009B00">(2 players, 1
all-in)</span></p>

<p><b>Total pot:</b> t2950</p>

<p>Results:<br />
SB had 6c, 6d (three of a kind, sixes).<br />
Hero had 3d, Ah (one pair, Aces).<br />
Outcome: SB won t2950</p>

<p>The longer a match, the more likely a badly played hand will occur. I
recently read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision
fatigue</a> and I think this
may be partially the cause. Decision fatigue is the idea that after
making many decisions people’s ability to make good decisions
deteriorates. A very interesting concept that applies to many scenarios.
Some salespeople try to bombard people with choice hoping they start
choosing badly. Be aware of how this affects you and how other people
may be using it against you.</p>

<p>This idea fits my poker play. The worst play comes at times when fatigue
is a possibility. As a beginning poker play, I make lots of decisions in
a game. I’ve not yet reached a point where I see patterns and the choice
is clear. Instead I think through nearly everything. In my last game, I
honestly thought twice about folding 72o out of position against a
pre-flop raise (but folded in the end). I can imagine I would quickly
become fatigued. The antidote is to only start playing when I feel
fresh, preferably after eating or resting. Of course the problem I will
will still get fatigued during a long game and then I’ll start making
decisions like playing another game! Hopefully the game will become more
routine and thus I’ll make less decisions when playing. Well, it’s worth
a try.</p>
