    <p>I recently returned from a holiday in Turkey. While there I visited the
ancient ruined Roman city of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ephesus">Ephesus</a>. At its peak in the 1st
century AD it had a population of over 250,000, but there is not a great
deal of evidence for that extent now. Although it did feel like there
are nearly that many people present when we visited.The best photos are
now a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157627739847990/show/">set on Flickr, available

    <p>When I first arrived in London, one of the great mysteries I faced was
the difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England">England</a>,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom">UK</a> , and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain">Great
Britain</a>. This is of no
small concern to the people of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales">Wales</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland">Scotland</a>. I almost found myself
attacked when I accidently (and mistakenly) referred to a famous Welsh
footballer as English - only claiming a foreigner’s ignorance saved me.
After a while I learnt the difference: England, Wales and Scotland are
all countries; the UK is the international state (thus it is the UK
government); and Great Britain is the name of the island.</p>

<p>When I arrived in Turkey on holiday I saw the following sign. Initially
I couldn’t find the UK, as it is out of alphabetical order. Then I
realised that it would be in alphabetical order if the label was for
England. If you look closely you can see the United Kingdom label is
actually a sticker. I would bet that underneath is England. Good to see
my confusion is shared by some governments. I can just image the regular
rants from Scottish and Welsh people that led to them correcting the
name!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last weekend I shot Dimitri Rascalov. Actually I shot him twice, once
for each of the two possible endings in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV">GTA
IV</a> (a video game).
Since <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/01/building-a-new-pc.html">getting a new
computer</a> at
the start of the year, I have started playing a few games. Before this
year the last game I played was
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeworld">Homeworld</a> around 2003, a bit
of an aberration really. The last time I often played games was in the
early 90’s -
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_%28video_game%29">Doom</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_%28video_game%29">Civ
(the original)</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28video_game%29">Dune 2</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity">SimCity</a>. Good times. So my
experience of the last 20 years of computer games is minimal, but the 10
years before that (basically my teenage and uni years) I played quite a
bit. So based on the small sample size of four games in the last 6
months, I would say computer games now are far better.</p>

<p>Admittedly, I’ve only played some of the better modern games - the
excellent GTA IV, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_Effect_2">Mass Effect 2
(ME2)</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_%28video_game%29">Portal</a>
and the merely good
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_Online:_Shadows_of_Angmar">LOTRO</a>.
Apart from the obvious improvement in graphics over time, what stuck me
was the appearance of proper storylines. The only detailed storylines I
remember from older games were from the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infocom">Infocom</a> text games. Now a
storyline seems to be mandatory. Over four months I played 73 hours (or
so Steam tells me) of GTA to complete the main story. Still I am only at
78% complete due to the side missions and tasks I skipped. The only
games I have ever played more are Civilization and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)">Elite</a>. The
reason for this is I wanted to see if Niko (the GTA player character)
achieves the American dream he is chasing (although in a criminal
manner). In other formats the story would be like an overly long B
gangster movie. However, it is quite involving when you are actually
playing it - it certainly didn’t feel like a grind to complete. Also,
the world in GTA felt almost alive with people walking around and rush
hour traffic. A couple of time I just cruised around Liberty City
sightseeing and listening to the radio. Ahh, the music in all the games
is good, so much better than the reactive beeps I remember from past
games. Now there is proper music mixed with games effects.</p>

<p>The only downside to GTA was the clunky controls. If GTA had the silky
smooth controls of ME2 I would have no complaints. Mass Effect had a
space-opera scifi plot that again got me involved. When one of my team
mates (played by the computer) got shot in the final mission (nicknamed
“the suicide mission”) I was a little upset. With the best and smoothest
graphics I’ve seen so far and an atmospheric soundtrack, the experience
is quite cinematic - only controlled by the player. Portal is the
shortest game I’ve played, but that is no complaint - it was just right.
I was utterly gripped by last hour. My hands were shaking a little from
the tension when I finished. The 10 hours or so of gameplay leading
leading up to the end perfectly built atmosphere at same time as
entertaining me with puzzle solving. So much thought must have gone into
structuring the finely balanced final product. Genius.</p>

<p>So no complaints or nostalgia from me. Hopefully this is part of a trend
of continual improvement and it only gets better from here. I am very
much looking forward to the next set of modern games. I’ve lined up
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare">Modern
Warfare</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock">Bioshock</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Cause_2">Just
Cause 2</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed:_Brotherhood">Assassin’s
Creed: Brotherhood</a> (mainly so I can cruise around a recreation of
medieval Rome!). The only downside is that it is clear that it took
large teams to finish these games - so there is no hope of me creating
anything nearly as polished. The end credits are as long as those at the
end of a movie. No longer can just a couple of people create a cutting
edge game (like Elite). Still, well done to everyone who helped make
them.</p>

    <p>For a game idea I needed a model of a spaceship. Having learnt from
previous tutorials, the main goal of this tutorial is to properly
texture a simple model for game engines. Instead of having multiple
materials for the mesh and textures applied to just a few faces, there
should be a single material for the entire mesh and textures should be
images applied to all the faces. Also normal maps should not be black
and white, but a special colour scheme. Thus setting up UV mappings and
proper normal maps is critical.</p>

<p><a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/spaceship/index.html">The continuation of this post is a set by step tutorial detailing my
methodology</a>.</p>
