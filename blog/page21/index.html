<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/463710">Puzzle Galaxies</a> is,
unsurprisingly, a simple puzzle game. It is moderately entertaining and
kept me playing for an hour, despite an unpolished feel. Considering the
very low cost (US$0.99, or even less when bundled) there is definitely
value for money. It is a decent, but unspectacular game.</p>

    <p><em>Update: this website is now shutdown. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube channel</a> still exists, but the old blog content moved here under the <a href="/blog/tag/A Gamedev Plays.html">A Gamedev Plays</a> tag.</em></p>

<p>I have set up a new website: <a href="http://www.agamedevplays.com/">A Gamedev
Plays…</a> will be dedicated to
discussion and reviews of all sorts of games (but mostly games that I
want to play). There is already an associated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a> and
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/agamedevplays">Steam group</a>. I will be
using the Jarrah Technology
<a href="https://www.twitter.com/JarrahTech">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook</a> pages for
promotional purposes at the moment.</p>

<p>I appear to be increasingly writing about games here. The desire to do
so will only increase. Unsurprising, considering that most of my time is
currently spent designing, building or just thinking about games. So I
thought it best to split out the games posts into their own website, as
such a monomanical focus was never the intention for this site. There
may still be games posts here, but only ones I feel are particularly
notable (similarly some of the old games posts from here may make it to
the new site).</p>

<p>The plan for the new site is to play more games and write about them,
both as a game design learning exercise and as motivation to create more
myself. As a secondary goal, I also hope to create a small community
around my games writing.</p>

<p>There is an explosion of game making at the moment. More and more games,
many with innovative ideas are being released. I need to be aware of
what is happening in game design. Since starting work on my own games I
can’t help but try to analyse what makes a game work (or not!) when I
play it. Being able to organise these thoughts into a coherent argument
in a presentable form can only help me improve my future games.</p>

<p><a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/153999/and-then-we-held-hands">…and then, we held

is a very interesting two-player only, cooperative board game, available
for free print &amp; play (P&amp;P) download or purchase. Despite having an
abstract design it is incredibly thematic.</p>

<p>Originally developed in just 48 hours as part of the 2014 Global Game
Jam, this board game went on to win best Golden Geek Print &amp; Play and
earn a proper published release. However, the rules of the GGJ state
that all games must be released under Creative Commons, so it will
always be available for free download, as long as you are willing to
create the components yourself. This review is for the free P&amp;P
version.</p>

<p><a href="https://gfx47.itch.io/gladiabots">Gladiabots</a> is a game of tactical bot
programming. The player programs their battle bots in a graphical logic
editor and then sets them against computer controlled enemies in an
arena. Currently free and in alpha testing, it is already a fun game,
and has a roadmap that suggests it will only improve.</p>

    <p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Welcome to the brand new “A Gamedev Plays…” website. Here there
will be regular reviews of both cardboard and computer games from the
perspective of a game developer. The games chosen will be whatever
catches my eye or, more likely, is sitting in my Steam backlog! Where
possible there will be videos of gameplay to go along with the text here
and if the game impresses, reviews on Steam or BoardGameGeek, or
wherever appropriate.</p>

<p>I’m starting this site both as a learning exercise and as motivation. I
need to play more games. There is an explosion of game making at the
moment. More and more games, many with innovative ideas are being
released. I need to be aware of what is happening in game design. Since
starting work on my own games I can’t help but try to analyse what makes
a game work (or not!) when I play it. Being able to organise these
thoughts into a coherent argument in a presentable form can only help me
improve my future games.</p>

<p>There is a dedicated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtmMVD8mPDfqt6j_o3nyw3Q">YouTube
channel</a> &amp;
<a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/agamedevplays">Steam group</a> for this
website. Also, my work <a href="https://www.twitter.com/JarrahTech">Twitter</a> and
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/JarrahTechnology">Facebook group</a> may be used
for promotion or notification.</p>

<p>Onward!</p>
