  <div class="content">
    <p>On Thursday the UK held a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom_alternative_vote_referendum">referendum on whether it should use the
Alternative Vote (AV) electoral
system</a>.
I didn’t hold much hope for an AV victory. While I believe AV is a
preferable over the current
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting">First-Past-The-Post</a>
(FPTP) electoral voting system, FPTP is ok and democracy generally runs
acceptably in Britain. It can be hard to get people out to vote on what
can seem like a minor issue and hard to get people to want change when
there doesn’t feel like a need for change. So with the political parties
split and voting voluntary, I expected AV to lose, and it did - by a
large margin. No problem. I’m not going to leave the UK over the
electoral system, at least not when there are so many other good reasons
to leave.</p>

<p>So what has made me care enough to write this, after the battle has been
lost? The day after the election I received a circular promoting the “No
to AV” campaign (good timing guys). There is an <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/_mia/5660630645/">image of the circular
on Flickr at this
address</a>. The third
bullet point states that Australia wants to get rid of it’s AV-like
electoral system. I left Australia 8 years ago, and I still read the
Australia papers nearly every day. I have seen no mention at all of this - not from the press (even the Murdoch press) or friends. I can honestly
say I have seen infinitely more support for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secessionism_in_Western_Australia">WA
succession</a>
(a fairly fringe position). After some investigation it seems that this
view is based on a single survey - <a href="http://blogs.abc.net.au/antonygreen/2011/02/do-australians-really-want-to-abandon-the-alternative-vote.html">generally considered
flawed</a>.
I can’t imagine there will be a referendum on voting system in Australia
for many years. The rest of the flyer seems similarly dishonest. Many of
the points based on the assumption that the person who gets the most
votes is the “winner” and “best” candidate, which is clearly not true.
Such a person has a plurality by definition, but “best” and “winner” are
defined by the voting system used - which is the question at hand.</p>

<p>The reason I prefer AV is because it give a result more representative
of the whole constituency, rather than just the plurality. Ignoring the
possibility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional_representation">Proportional
Representation</a>
(which, to my mind, is a different argument entirely), if we assume
constituency based democracy, where one person represents an geographic
area, then it is better to have the person who most closely matches the
views of the majority of constituents (or at least those that vote). If
you disagree, well you are in the majority (in an election with only two
options AV and FPTP are effectively the same). I just wish that the
campaign to build that majority didn’t print bullshit.</p>

    <p>After creating a simple game with Ogre3D (<a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/5_ogre/index.html">part
1</a> &amp; <a href="http://cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/6_ogre_part2/index.html">part
2</a>),
I thought I should try a different library for comparison. In this
tutorial I will detail the steps used to create the same game as the
previous tutorials, but using <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> instead.
Unity3D is a commercial game development tool, although there is a free
version with less functionality (I used the free version). While Ogre3D
just provides a graphics library (with plugins for other tools), Unity3D
provides almost everything “in the box”: 3D graphics, sound, physics,
networking and more. It allows a number of languages for scripting - I
used Javascript, as that is the one with which I am most familiar. The
free version allows deployment to Windows or the web (using a browser
plugin), the paid version adds Android and iOS.</p>

Podcasts</a></p>

<p>This podcast series investigates the sarcophagus and skeleton of
<a href="http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/p/painted_sarcophagus.aspx">Seianti</a>,
an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization">Etruscan</a>
noblewoman who died around 150BC and was buried near
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiusi">Chiusi</a> (which was under Roman
control, but not fully Roman until after the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_War_(91%E2%80%9388_BC)">Social
War</a>). Similar to many of the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk">Open
University</a> podcasts I have been reviewing, it is
part of the course <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/Arts/a219/index.shtml">Exploring the Classical World
(A219)</a>. There are 4 video
podcasts in the series and an introductory audio only podcast. The video
podcasts are in documentary format, normally showing a talking head or
an object being described. The video podcasts are all from 6 to 9
minutes long and recorded at 640x360 resolution, or a smaller iPod
optimised format. Transcripts are available in PDF format.</p>

<p>The videos go through what is known about Seianti, details of her
sarcophagus, a pathologist’s report on her skeleton and the details of a
facial reconstruction. The resulting reconstruction shows a face similar
to the sculpture on the sarcophagus - just younger and prettier. It is
suggested that this makes the sculpture the earliest known named
portrait in western art. The name, Seianti Hanunia Tlesnasa, was cut
into the sarcophagus’ clay when it was still wet. Thus the sarcophagus
was made specifically for its occupant, which since it was the only set
of remains in the tomb, suggests Seianti must have been a person of some
note.</p>

<p>The sculpture on the sarcophagus, shows a figure wearing a veil and
bedecked in jewellery. The jewellery was originally painted gold and the
figure white - apparently it was fashionable at the time for women to be
appear pale. However, there is no suggestion in the remains that Seianti
was unhealthy. Examination of the skeleton suggests an active, robust
woman of 50-55 (old for the time), who had children. There were no signs
of violence or long term illness other than a damaged pelvis (probably
from a riding injury at around age 16) and very bad dental hygiene. It
seems Seianti would have had incredibly bad breath, even by the low
standards of the ancient world.</p>

<p>Intriguing and worth watching.</p>
