    <p>I have succumbed to a fad - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_desk">the standing
desk</a>. Now that I have moved
countries and needed to set up my working environment again, I though
I’d try standing rather than sitting. After injuring my foot nearly two
years ago now, I have found that after sitting a desk for several hours
(as I tend to do when concentrating hard) the injury gets worse. Only
very regular stretching and walking compensates for the sitting I do as
part of the normal working day. Moving into our new flat, I found a
couple of small bedside tables that were the perfect height for setting
up a standing arrangement.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/standing_desk.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After a week of standing, it now feels comfortable. At first my heels
would ache and my foot seemed tense. I think this was due to me standing
with locked knees and having all my weight run down through my heels.
Now I lean a little forward and take most weight through the pads of my
feet (just behind the toes). Rolling my feet on a tennis ball
occasionally also helps. I also find it easier to jiggle around and
move, rather than stay completely stationary. There is less impedance to
moving around. I can’t say my foot is any better, but neither is it any
worse. In any case the standing makes me more mobile and less stiff, so
I will continue using it for now.</p>

    <p>The end is near. No not the end of this blog. The end of my time in
London. In a couple of days I will be on a plane to South-East Asia.
Most of the luggage has already left. I’m in that weird disconnected
in-between state where I’m not sure what I should be doing. In any case,
this blog may be neglected for the next couple of weeks as I complete
the move and discover first-hand how good Internet access is in
Malaysia. I have heard it is very good and hope to be back soon. Until
then, goodbye.</p>

    <p>Britain has two postal systems. The main one is the well known <a href="http://www.royalmail.com">Royal
Mail</a>. The vast majority of mail goes through
this system and uses the standard UK postcode system. If you have sent
mail to or from Britain, this is almost certainly the system you have
used. The other system is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Forces_Post_Office">British Forces Post Office
(BFPO)</a>. It is
for sending post to British Forces abroad. Technically this means it
predates the Royal Mail, as the first English postal system was set up
for English soldiers in Scotland or France. The idea is that you send
mail to the BFPO address in Britain and then the government will ensure
it reaches the appropriate person around the world without handing it
over to anyone outside the British government. Normally this means the
military delivers it, but it can also go through diplomatic or foreign
office channels.</p>

<p>BFPO address look quite different to Royal Mail address. They just have
the addressee’s name, their id code and the BFPO Code. Sometimes a
postcode is appended for getting through some mail systems, <a href="https://maps.google.co.uk/maps?q=ha4+6ep">HA4
6EP</a> - check it out. For
example BFPO 792 is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bastion">Camp
Bastion</a> in Afghanistan, BFPO
305 is the navy ship
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMS_Illustrious_(R06)">HMS
Illustrious</a> and BFPO 5439 is the High Commission in Kuala Lumpur.
That last one is my new address and thus I have discovered the great
problem with BFPO addresses. Very few people seem to know how they work.
To all UK (and to a lesser extent, worldwide) web developers, there is
more than one UK post system - please handle it! In particular, pooks to
you HSBC - I expected better from an “international” bank.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently finished reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Fire_Upon_the_Deep">A Fire Upon The
Deep</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Star_Fraction">The Star
Fraction</a>. Both are
science-fiction novels written in the early-mid 1990’s by authors with a
computer science background, and both share (as part of the background
context) a somewhat antiquated concern with network bandwidth. A Fire
Upon The Deep is a rollicking <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_opera">space
opera</a> - an exciting and fast
paced adventure containing many interesting ideas. The Star Fraction is
a near future tale of a possible singularity event (largely avoided) and
wasn’t nearly as enjoyable due to a dominant preoccupation with politics
that didn’t flow nicely with the action.</p>

<p>Both novels feature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet-like</a>
communication and both fret at points about having enough bandwidth. I
think Star Fraction even makes a reference to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)">gopher</a> at
one point. Younger readers might wonder what I’m talking about. In the
early 90’s the dominant forms of communication on the Internet were
email and Usenet. The Web had just been developed, but had not yet
gained popularity, and it was competing with the similar Gopher
technology. Usenet was a system of discussion groups like modern message
forums (e.g. Reddit), but much more primitive. At the time bandwidth was
severely limited and often a concern. For playing a text-only online
game in 1992, I was banned from a computer system for excessive
bandwidth usage amounting to a few hundred kilobytes over several hours!
Email has survived, but Usenet and Gopher have both been superseded by
the more flexible Web. Bandwidth has risen to the level where HD movies
(measured in gigabytes) can easily be watched online.</p>

<p>I can imagine both authors were blinded by their closeness to their
contemporary technology to see the revolutionary change about to occur.
Thus their books are now quaintly dated. It is interesting to compare
this to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer">Neuromancer</a>. Written
a decade earlier than the other novels and dealing heavily with computer
networks, it hasn’t aged too badly with its portrayal of cyberspace (a
term first coined in the book), despite being written by someone with
little background in computing. In an interview the author states that
the Net as depicted in Neuromancer was a metaphor for the media, but it
still works. Evidence of the cliche that being too much of an expert can
cloud your powers of extrapolation.</p>
