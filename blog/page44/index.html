  <div class="content">
    <p>After <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/old-dd-campaign-maps.html">posting some
maps</a>
from my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a>
campaign, I got a little nostalgic for the game. Here is a history of
that campaign in many parts (it did run for 5 years). While I would
prefer to tell the stories “in character”, my memory of the first year
or so is a little fuzzy, so this first part of the history will be
largely a statement of actions (as remembered) without too much creative
embellishment.</p>

<p>I first started playing D&amp;D in 1985, when I got the famous 1983 red box
version of the old original 1st edition basic set. With a few friends we
played a few little adventures, but it never really got any traction. It
was only in late 1987 that a permanent game emerged. We just called it
the “campaign”, although during its 5 year existence we played more than
one game. There was a single D&amp;D game that thread through the years, but
there was a significant amount of the scandalously unknown
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2300_AD">2300AD</a>, plus brief sojourns with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk_2020">Cyberpunk 2020</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Role_Playing">MERP</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond_007_(role-playing_game)">James
Bond RPG</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warhammer_Fantasy_Roleplay">Warhammer
FRPG</a>. However,
we started and finished with D&amp;D.</p>

<p>The first session was held in my bedroom after school on a Friday. A
bunch of eight 12-13 year old boys. We rolled up characters, with the
special rule that each character could have one automatic 18 (the
highest possible value) in an attribute of their choice and the rest
should be rolled normally. Still most characters had two 18s - we must
have been a very lucky bunch. One of the “lucky” ones was the magic-user
Bandance, that was my character. I am also certain there was another
magic-user, Greymarel, in the party. Kur-Tas Kai, a cleric of the war
god
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dragonlance_deities#Kiri-Jolith">Kiri-Jolith</a>
(we used the Krynn dieties) might have been present, but if not was
definitely around by the second adventure. I don’t remember the rest -
most of them didn’t last long.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/B2ModuleCover.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>For the first few adventures we would rotate the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master">Dungeon Master
(DM)</a> position among the
group. Later I took on the role permanently. I don’t know who was the
first DM, but it definitely wasn’t me. The first adventure was the
classic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands">Keep on the
Borderlands</a>.
Arriving at the Keep the party was soon approached by a shadowy figure
and hired to kill the Castellan. Being adventuring neophytes, the party
neglected to demand some money upfront. The Castellan, hearing that a
group of sturdy young men from out of town had arrived, invited them to
dinner. At the dinner he suggested he had a job for the party, but got
no further. Bandance attacked and quickly killed the Castellan. The rest
of the party was shocked but regardless included in the resulting melee
with the guards. They managed to escape by starting fires in the Keep
and running into the surrounding wilderness. There the party stayed a
few days exploring the local caves before attempting a return to the
Keep in order to collect their reward. However their passage was blocked
and no reward was forthcoming. Realising they had been ripped off and
tired of trudging around the dangerous borderlands, they decided to
return home. I’m not sure this adventure went as the DM planned.</p>

<p>Next a much smaller group of players did <a href="http://rpggeek.com/rpgissuearticle/139/the-beacon-at-enon-tor">The Beacon at Enon
Tor</a>
adventure. I don’t remember much about this other than it was short and
involved saving a mad wizard. Nor can I remember the next small
adventure we did, Jack of Knaves (which I can’t even find on Google).</p>

<p>Next a larger group got together and played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rahasia">Rahasia</a>. At this stage the group
was Greymarel, Bandance and Kur-Tas Kai plus the dwarf Kleeton, the
fighter Hugle, the thief Aeflebad and the elf Celembor (this is in notes
taken at the time). The party was hired to save an elven princess from
an evil temple. Payment this time was whatever treasure we found on the
way. As we played it, there wasn’t a great deal of combat in this
adventure. For the first (and probably last) time the party even managed
to talk its way out of a fight. The most dangerous encounter was between
members of the party itself. After the princess was saved, a fight broke
out over how to split the treasure. Bandance was on the losing side. My
notes for this adventure state “saved princess, befriended intelligent
snake, almost got lynched by party over magic items and now holds
grudge”.</p>

<p>The straight up goblin-bashing of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_on_the_Hill">The Horror on the
Hill</a> was next. This
was quickly followed by the equally badly named and similar orc-bashing
of Death Dungeon. Neither of these were particularly notable and both
mainly involved constant fighting with a little exploring thrown in. I’m
certain I DM’ed these two (especially since I wrote Death Dungeon and it
wouldn’t be fair that I play it too). At this point the party added
Talin (a ranger) and a little later Ugarit (a fighter and not the right
name, but neither I nor the person playing him can remember what he was
called), but lost a couple of the others. So the group was Greymarel,
Bandance, Kur-Tas Kai, Celembor, Ugarit and Talin. However, the person
playing Celembor left somewhere around here after having personal
differences with a few other players. I remember it centered on how to
have fun in roleplaying games. Celembor said he played in a way to have
fun without caring about the other players, while the rest of the party
said it was about having fun as a group. I think this counter-argument
was lead by the person playing Kur-Tas Kai, who was becoming de facto
party spokesman. Celembor was increasingly disruptive and ostracized by
the rest of the party until he left. At this stage we started playing a
hybrid of D&amp;D with AD&amp;D and some homebrew rules. The result was combat
was quicker (with critical hits and misses) and spell-casters more
powerful.</p>

<p>The last adventure of the campaign’s early stage was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dread">Isle of
Dread</a>. Again my memory
is hazy on this and I have no notes to fall back on. The party sailed
across the ocean and investigated a semi-tropical island, killing locals
until we got tired and sailed home. By the end the campaign had been
running over a year and all the characters were level 5. This was also
the last adventure not DM’ed by me. It was also the last standalone
adventure. After this the adventures merged into one another as a
continuous story, albeit one that was largely made-up as we went along.</p>

    <p>Available from

and on its blog, <a href="http://thehistoryofrome.typepad.com">The History of
Rome</a></p>

<p>This podcast series by Mike Duncan aims to tell the complete history of
Rome from founding through the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Republic</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_empire">Empire</a> to its fall. There
are 189 episodes for a total of 74 hours (each episode being around 20
minutes in length). The podcasts are audio only and have high production
values (the first few are a little more raw, but still fine).</p>

<p>I am breaking one of my rules and reviewing this series before having
completely finished it. I am only a quarter of the way through. This
means I’m listened to 59 episodes totalling 17 hours and have only just
reached the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Actium">Battle of
Actium</a> in 31 BC marking
the end of the Republic. This is a huge and comprehensive history of
Rome. It covers in detail the events that other series tend to skim
over. Other histories I have consumed tend to start in the late
Republic, and don’t really get going until reaching
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar</a> or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus">Augustus</a>. Here, the 400 year
period of the Kingdom, early, and middle Republic (ending with the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gracchi">Gracchi</a>) is covered over 36
episodes and 10 hours. Roman history is presented in chronological order
and in detail. The various early political manoeuvrings around Patrician
versus Plebeian laws, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samnite_Wars">Samnite
wars</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_War">Latin
war</a> are all covered along with
much more. Looking at the episode list, I can only assume this fine
coverage continues all the way to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">fall of the Western Roman
Empire</a>
in 476 AD.</p>

<p>Mike is a great speaker and the information is presented in an
interesting manner. Often he will say a story is probably apocryphal,
but then give the detail anyway. Very entertaining. This series is
highly recommended.</p>

    <p>As part of preparing for moving to Malaysia many items are being dragged
out of storage and assessed - keep or discard? I recently went through
my old <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_&amp;_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> stuff,
some to be sold, but most to be kept. Also, I scanned all my old notes.
There are some embarrassingly bad drawings and maps in there, but here
are the better ones. They were all drawn in 1988 or 1989, when I was in
my early teens.</p>

<p>These are the maps for a small adventure called The Inverted Tower. A
mage was terrorizing some islands from his underground lair. The players
had to stop him. Power crazed wizards were a recurring theme in our
campaign.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/rpg/Inverted_Tower.pdf"><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/IT_Preview.png" alt="Inverted Tower" /></a></p>

<p>This is the small town of Highdell. In our campaign it was the last
population centre before the wild borderlands north of the players
hometown (although there was still the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keep_on_the_Borderlands">Keep on the
Borderlands</a> a
little further out).</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/rpg/Highdell.pdf"><img src="/assets/posts/rpg/Highdell_Preview.png" alt="Highdell" /></a></p>

<p>This is a castle layout. I don’t remember it being in the game - but we
visited castles regularly, so it was probably used as a “generic” castle
a few times. I used to enjoy designing castles, but rarely completed
drawing them - this is one of two I have left (and definitely the better
one).</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>In Unity3D how can it be determined if a point is on the line segment
joining two other points? My current project throws up just such
geometry problems regularly. The problem as expressed above is a
question of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collinearity">collinearity</a>,
that is whether some points form a line. The first step uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_product">cross
product</a>. If you have the
points A, B, C then if the cross product of the line AB and the line AC
is 0, AB and AC must be parallel. Furthermore, since both lines include
the point A, all the points must in fact be collinear. Luckily, there is
a cross product function built into the Unity3D library,
<a href="http://docs.unity3d.com/Documentation/ScriptReference/Vector3.Cross.html">Vector3.Cross</a>.</p>

<p>Next, just because A, B, C are collinear does not mean C is in between A
and B. To determine this, check that C is inside the 3D volume with A &amp;
B as diametrically opposed corners. That is just check that C’s x-axis
value is inbetween A’s &amp; C’s and the same for its y-axis and z-axis
values. The function below combines these tests. Note the range checks
are performed first. This is because I imagine that the cross product is
more computationally expensive (but I have no evidence for this) so
should occur only if the faster calls succeed.</p>

    <p>Thanks to various Indie Bundles I now have scores of “small indie
games”. That is not meant to be disparaging (I aspire to create such
little games), just an assesment of their scope. Small teams have
necessarily smaller ambitions - at least they do if they want to finish!
Without further ado, here are my thoughts on 10 of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)">The
Binding of Isaac</a> is a great game and quite addictive. It is a sort
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a>. Each game lasts
around 30 minutes (although I’m yet to reach the last level) with the
player advancing room-by-room through a dungeon. The gameplay is
randomised with a reasonable number of monster types, but a huge array
of objects/upgrades. It is very easy to get started but very hard to
complete and luck plays a large role. Graphics and sound are good, plus
it has religious metaphors and poo jokes - definitely a winner. This is
staying on my desktop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.steel-storm.com/">Steel Storm</a> is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_'em_up">top-down arcade
shooter</a> that is not too hectic. It is not on rails so the player has
some choice and can play the game at their own pace. The gameplay is
quite good and I completed the single player campaign in 10 hours. The
only downside is that it gets a bit repetitive in the later levels and
the homing missiles seem to solve all problems (for all enemies just
back up behind cover and fire homing missiles). Still definitely fun and
worth the few dollars it costs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crayonphysics.com/">Crayon Physics Deluxe</a> a puzzler where
the player draws in crayon on the screen to create physics objects. For
instance, a swinging mallet can be drawn to hit a ball and propel it
across the screen. Nice idea, well implemented, but not for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cogsgame.com/">Cogs</a> is another puzzle game where the player
moves around tiles to form particular patterns. I like this and got
about a quarter of the way through in an hour, but it got much more
difficult towards the end. It is staying on my desktop as I can see
myself playing this occasionally.</p>

<p>I would consider <a href="http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/">Osmos</a> a
puzzler, but an unusual one. You play as a floating blob looking to
absorb other smaller blobs while avoiding larger blobs that can absorb
you. At first it seems hypnotic and relaxing, but soon becomes
frustrating in a good way. Staying on my desktop.</p>

<p><a href="http://universesandbox.com/">Universe Sandbox</a> is a gravity simulator.
You can model the solar system or stars falling into a black hole or
anything. It’s quite pretty and has a range of interesting preset
scenarios. However at larger timescales the simulation breaks down and
when setting up bespoke scenarios it’s hard put objects in the exact
right spot (if for instance putting planets at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point">Lagrange
points</a>). The developer
was at
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/unite12---day-3.html">Unite12</a> and
mentioned they are working on version 2 which will address these points.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.koshutin.com/">Hammerfight</a> is a 2D side-view fight game
where the players fly barrel-like contraptions and hit eachother with
hammers (hence the name). It held my interest for about 30 minutes
before the clunky controls and a screen so cluttered I couldn’t see the
action ruined it for me. The basic idea seemed to be just furiously
moving the mouse to swing the hammer. A nice idea, but perhaps a little
too slight.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finalformgames.com/jamestown/">Jamestown</a> is a classic
top-down shooter with 8 bit graphics. It is fast and furious like I
remember the old arcade games
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game)">1942</a> comes
to mind). This is not my sort of game, I prefer something slower.</p>

<p>My review of the last 3 games is the same.
<a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>, <a href="http://www.andyetitmoves.net/">And Yet It
Moves</a> and <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Super Meat
Boy</a> are all platformers. In these games the
source of difficulty is often not working out what needs to be done, but
actually performing the required actions with split-second accuracy.
Again, not my sort of game. Still, I can appreciate them: AYIM has an
interesting ripped paper art style; and, VVVVVV is a glorious 8 bit
throwback. However, they have all been removed from my desktop after
less than an hour each of play.</p>
