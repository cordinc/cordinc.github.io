    <p>Having crated a basic low-poly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha">mecha</a> model in <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blender/tutorials/mech/1_model/index.html">a previous
tutorial</a>,
it is now time to liven up the model by texturing it. The application of
materials and textures is the hardest part of modelling for me, and I’m
not entirely happy with the result. My artistic abilities need some
work. However, the general technique is still worth noting. The tutorial
will show how the mech model was made to look as below. Later tutorials
will show how to rig the model and animate a walk cycle.</p>

    <p>I decided to move away from historical models for this tutorial. I chose
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha">mecha</a>, a walking robot, as an
exercise in texturing, rigging and animation. The idea is to first
create a low-poly model so that most of the visual detail is in the
textures applied. Then a walk cycle will be animated using bone rigging
to aid further animations. The result will be the sort of model that
could be used in a simple game. As there are quite a few steps in
achieving all of this, the tutorial has been split into four parts. This
first part creates the base model. Following posts will cover texturing,
rigging and animating.</p>

<p>‘Buildings of Ancient Rome’ is another of the consistently good <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open
University</a> short podcasts. This one describes
and details the histories of certain buildings (mainly temples) of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome">Ancient Rome</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circus_Flaminius">Circus
Flaminus</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largo_di_Torre_Argentina">Largo
Argentina</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Forum">Roman Forum</a>. Thus it focuses
on a few quite small (and, apart from the Forum, less well-known) areas
of ancient Roman ruins. The format is a series of 5 short video
documentaries (although iTunes only lists 4 videos on its iPod page, it
then lists all 5 on the Mac/PC page). The videos are available in a
640x360 format or a smaller iPod optimised format. They range from 2
minutes to 15 minutes in length, and transcripts are also available.</p>

<p>The videos are made entirely of pictures of the temples/buildings being
discussed in their current state (with the very occasional floor plan).
The audio comprises details of the buildings and their history. There
are no reconstructions or interviews. The information comes think and
fast - dates of construction (and sometimes destruction), architectural
notes, interesting events in their history and how it is thought they
were used. It can be hard to orientate yourself - a little knowledge of
Rome’s history and layout helps immensely. Interesting, but not
introductory.</p>

    <p>The last few days before the UK election saw the image below circulating
around the city. I saw it first on <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com">FT
Alphaville</a>. I find this image incredibly
annoying. Not because the message is necessarily wrong. There is a
strong case to be made that the Labour’s party’s rhetoric on their
ability to manage the UK economy is in no way matched by their actual
management of the economy (although it’s debatable whether the Tories
would have been any better). Instead, it is because the image is using a
misunderstood part of the financial world to produce a misleading graph.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/boom-to-bust.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/boom-to-bust.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The image is a graph of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index">FTSE
100</a> stock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_index">market
index</a> of the largest
companies listed on the <a href="www.londonstockexchange.com/">London Stock Exchange
(LSE)</a>. It is a UK version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500">S&amp;P
500</a>. Like other share indexes
it is often quoted on the news in absolute terms as well as the absolute
rise or drop over some time period. For example yesterday the FTSE 100
closed at 5123, a drop of 138 points. However, to compare movements the
absolute point value should not be used. This is because the index is
calculated as the change relative to some reference date. Calculated
from this base, the larger the index, the larger point move required to
be equivalent to a move at a smaller index move. A 2% move when the
index is at 5000 is 100 points, when the index is at 2000 an equivalent
move is 40 points. As the index gets larger, point movements will
naturally become larger for no difference in activity. Thus the graph
above is misleading because it exaggerates the more recent point moves
at a larger index level compared to the earlier moves.</p>

<p>It is the percentage move that is important. If the graph showed
percentage moves the 1987 crash would appear much larger and the recent
crashes smaller. To better show the relative moves, I found a graph of
the <a href="http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=^FTSE#chart3:symbol=^ftse;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">FTSE using a logarithmic scale on
Yahoo</a>.
As can be seen below the recent boom and bust don’t seem as large, but
they are still there. So the same message could have been sent with a
less misleading graph.</p>

    <p>Greece is collapsing. So says the media. The news regularly shows riots
in Athens; the papers discuss the dire economic straits. A person here
in London could easily form the view the precipice is near.</p>

<p>Having spent a week in Athens last month, I didn’t leave with the
impression disaster was imminent. People generally seemed to be going
about their daily business. There were no clear signs of distress (apart
from one incongruity). Indeed, other cities I have visited appeared to
be in worse situations. While a large amount of my time was spent in
busy tourist throngs around the archealogical sites, I also travelled
out into the surrounding areas. What I saw appeared to be a working
city. There were numerous storefronts with decent traffic and many
business offices. The streets became busier after work hours. Bars and
resturants were quiet during the day, but became busy late in the night.
At one point we saw a crowd blocking a street near Syntagma, it could
have been a well behaved protest, or just as easily people waiting for
some celebrity. There was a lot of graffiti, but also a lot of graffiti
art. Not so different to London really and there was probably about the
same number of unused/abandoned buildings. Although unlike London, many
of the occupied buildings appeared quite run-down and not well
maintained.</p>

<p>There was one indication of possible problems. On a quiet side street
North-East of Omonoia we walked past trees, parked cars, buildings that
looked like apartment blocks, and little shops. Then there were two
burnt out cars next to each other. They were completely wrecked - the
fire destroyed everything. However, there was no damage apart from the
cars. Either the fire was somewhere else and then the wrecks dumped
there or the immediately surrounding area was cleaned up (but the cars
left). Both seem strange. Apart from these wrecks, Athens did not feel
different to most cities I have visited.</p>

<p>Cities are ususally places of vibrant activity - normally business
related. Visit London, Paris, Sydney, Barcelona or Milan and you feel
you are in a working city. There is the sense that the locals are busy
getting things done. Travelling around London, I am constantly amazed by
the number and variety of business nameplates outside buildings. You can
walk for hours from Shoreditch across to Hammersmith and it is busy
offices the entire way. Washington and Rome feel more dominated by
tourism and government, but there is still lots happening around you.
Two places I feel didn’t match this description, at the time I visited,
are Lisbon and Tunis. There was a general lack of activity in Lisbon, it
seemed almost empty. Never have I seen so many empty, decrepit
buildings. Tunis was similar, full of people, but they didn’t seem to be
doing much. There was always a large number of men sitting in cafes,
presumably un- or underemployed. These two cities felt like they were in
dire economic straits. Indeed, Portugal is currently mentioned in
similar financial terms to Greece, but that situation was clearer on the
streets of Lisbon than Athens.</p>
