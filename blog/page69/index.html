    <p>The last few days before the UK election saw the image below circulating
around the city. I saw it first on <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com">FT
Alphaville</a>. I find this image incredibly
annoying. Not because the message is necessarily wrong. There is a
strong case to be made that the Labour’s party’s rhetoric on their
ability to manage the UK economy is in no way matched by their actual
management of the economy (although it’s debatable whether the Tories
would have been any better). Instead, it is because the image is using a
misunderstood part of the financial world to produce a misleading graph.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/boom-to-bust.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/boom-to-bust.jpg" width="550" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The image is a graph of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTSE_100_Index">FTSE
100</a> stock <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_index">market
index</a> of the largest
companies listed on the <a href="www.londonstockexchange.com/">London Stock Exchange
(LSE)</a>. It is a UK version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500">S&amp;P
500</a>. Like other share indexes
it is often quoted on the news in absolute terms as well as the absolute
rise or drop over some time period. For example yesterday the FTSE 100
closed at 5123, a drop of 138 points. However, to compare movements the
absolute point value should not be used. This is because the index is
calculated as the change relative to some reference date. Calculated
from this base, the larger the index, the larger point move required to
be equivalent to a move at a smaller index move. A 2% move when the
index is at 5000 is 100 points, when the index is at 2000 an equivalent
move is 40 points. As the index gets larger, point movements will
naturally become larger for no difference in activity. Thus the graph
above is misleading because it exaggerates the more recent point moves
at a larger index level compared to the earlier moves.</p>

<p>It is the percentage move that is important. If the graph showed
percentage moves the 1987 crash would appear much larger and the recent
crashes smaller. To better show the relative moves, I found a graph of
the <a href="http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/echarts?s=^FTSE#chart3:symbol=^ftse;range=my;indicator=volume;charttype=line;crosshair=on;ohlcvalues=0;logscale=on;source=undefined">FTSE using a logarithmic scale on
Yahoo</a>.
As can be seen below the recent boom and bust don’t seem as large, but
they are still there. So the same message could have been sent with a
less misleading graph.</p>

    <p>Greece is collapsing. So says the media. The news regularly shows riots
in Athens; the papers discuss the dire economic straits. A person here
in London could easily form the view the precipice is near.</p>

<p>Having spent a week in Athens last month, I didn’t leave with the
impression disaster was imminent. People generally seemed to be going
about their daily business. There were no clear signs of distress (apart
from one incongruity). Indeed, other cities I have visited appeared to
be in worse situations. While a large amount of my time was spent in
busy tourist throngs around the archealogical sites, I also travelled
out into the surrounding areas. What I saw appeared to be a working
city. There were numerous storefronts with decent traffic and many
business offices. The streets became busier after work hours. Bars and
resturants were quiet during the day, but became busy late in the night.
At one point we saw a crowd blocking a street near Syntagma, it could
have been a well behaved protest, or just as easily people waiting for
some celebrity. There was a lot of graffiti, but also a lot of graffiti
art. Not so different to London really and there was probably about the
same number of unused/abandoned buildings. Although unlike London, many
of the occupied buildings appeared quite run-down and not well
maintained.</p>

<p>There was one indication of possible problems. On a quiet side street
North-East of Omonoia we walked past trees, parked cars, buildings that
looked like apartment blocks, and little shops. Then there were two
burnt out cars next to each other. They were completely wrecked - the
fire destroyed everything. However, there was no damage apart from the
cars. Either the fire was somewhere else and then the wrecks dumped
there or the immediately surrounding area was cleaned up (but the cars
left). Both seem strange. Apart from these wrecks, Athens did not feel
different to most cities I have visited.</p>

<p>Cities are ususally places of vibrant activity - normally business
related. Visit London, Paris, Sydney, Barcelona or Milan and you feel
you are in a working city. There is the sense that the locals are busy
getting things done. Travelling around London, I am constantly amazed by
the number and variety of business nameplates outside buildings. You can
walk for hours from Shoreditch across to Hammersmith and it is busy
offices the entire way. Washington and Rome feel more dominated by
tourism and government, but there is still lots happening around you.
Two places I feel didn’t match this description, at the time I visited,
are Lisbon and Tunis. There was a general lack of activity in Lisbon, it
seemed almost empty. Never have I seen so many empty, decrepit
buildings. Tunis was similar, full of people, but they didn’t seem to be
doing much. There was always a large number of men sitting in cafes,
presumably un- or underemployed. These two cities felt like they were in
dire economic straits. Indeed, Portugal is currently mentioned in
similar financial terms to Greece, but that situation was clearer on the
streets of Lisbon than Athens.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>This week saw a visit to <a href="http://www.harwoodarms.com/index.htm">The Harwood
Arms</a> - a gastro pub in Fulham,
recently awarded a Michelin star. It is round a few corners from Fulham
Road, on a quiet suburban street. From the outside the place looks like
a pub, but inside it is set up like a restaurant. Apart from the bar and
a small sofa area, the entire floorspace is occupied with tables. So I
can’t imagine your meal would ever be interrupted by casual drinkers,
although there is a quiz night every Tuesday.</p>

<p>The menu focusses on British produce with a special emphasis on game,
most of which is apparently hunted or caught by the owners. For a
starter I had a wild mushroom soup with mussel fritters. There was a
surprisingly large amount, although it was so nice it certainly was not
a problem to get through it all. The main dish was shoulder of deer for
two with celeriac mash, vegetables and a little salad. It all came on a
large platter so that you could carve the shoulder yourself. However,
this wasn’t at all arduous as the meat was so beautifully tender it just
fell off the bone. Again, a large amount of delightful food. After that
I was too full for dessert, but I’m assured the sticky toffee and date
ice cream with lemon curd was delicious.</p>

<p>The Harwood Arms had a pleasant atmosphere, not quite a pub but still
welcoming. Service was prompt and courteous. The cost was reasonable for
a top restaurant (by London standards!), dinner for two (starters, main
and one dessert) with wine was under £100. Excellent food and well worth
a visit.</p>

and <a href="http://podcast.open.ac.uk/oulearn/arts-and-humanities/podcast-a219-greek-theatre">OU
Podcasts</a></p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk/">Open University</a> series examines theatre
during the time of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Greece">Classical
Greece</a>. In particular it
details the production of the world’s oldest surviving play <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persians">The
Persians by Aeschylus</a>, first
performed in Athens at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_Dionysus">Theatre of
Dionysus</a> in 472BC.
Like the other OU podcasts, this series is a set of short documentaries
to accompany lectures. There are 4 video podcasts totalling around 40
minutes in length, with the individual videos ranging from 7 to 14
minutes. They are available in iPod or a larger (640x360) format. There
are also transcripts. The visuals are mainly talking heads interspersed
with shots of theatre ruins, vases or in later episodes modern
productions of The Persians.</p>

<p>The first video details what the Theatre of Dionysus would have looked
like in the 5th century BC and what it would have meant culturally to
attend the theatre at that time. Performances would have been important
events, it is estimated that the theatre could probably hold around a
third of the male citizens of Athens (it is not certain women were
allowed to attend). The second video covers the actors and chorus in
Ancient Greek theatre. Ancient Greek plays only had 2 or 3 actors, who
would each play multiple parts while wearing masks. The next video
examines how some Greek plays have managed to survive 2500 years - only
7 of Aeschylus’ estimated 90 plays still exist. The last episode
discusses some modern interpretations of The Persians.</p>

<p>A good short podcast series, but probably only for people particularly
interested in Ancient Greek theatre.</p>
