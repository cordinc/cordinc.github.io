  <div class="content">
    <p>It was recently suggested to me that there could be risk-free money to
be made crossing <a href="http://www.betfair.com">Betfair</a> and
<a href="http://www.betdaq.com">Betdaq</a>. Betfair and Betdaq are betting
exchanges - they allow their users to bet on various events, from the
traditional horse races to more unusual fare like netball or the UK
general election. Unlike a normal bookmaker, the exchanges don’t provide
the odds and take the opposing side of the bet. Instead the odds are
determined by other users and the other side is another user. So while
there may be someone offering 1.15 odds that Labour will win (a <a href="http://help.betfair.com/contents/itemId/i65767719/index.en.html">back
bet</a>)
the next UK election, someone else may offer 1.2 that they will lose (a
<a href="http://help.betfair.com/contents/itemId/i65767719/index.en.html">lay
bet</a>).
When the back and lay odds match then a bet is made. Note, all the odds
quoted in this article are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-odds_betting#Decimal_odds">decimal
odds</a> as
this is the type of odds used on the exchanges.</p>

I could not find a course website.</p>

<p>This is a series of 8 anthropology lectures on the topic Socities in
Transition recorded at <a href="http://www.linacre.ox.ac.uk/Linacre">Linacre College, Oxford
University</a> during early 2009. Each
podcast is just under an hour and audio only (occasional mention is made
of slides). Each lecture is given by a different presenter. All are
fairly academic in nature (a couple are quite dry and I found it hard to
maintain concentration), but are still accessible to the non-expert.
These lectures are not straight history, there is little discussion of
historical events. Instead each podcast presents current research on the
process of social transition during a notable period of history. They
often provide an interesting snapshot (or at least intriguing tidbits)
of life around the time of the transition.</p>

<p>The lectures are in chronological order, spanning the entirity of human
history - and beyond. The first lecture is on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal">Neanderthals</a> - their slow
extinction and modern discovery. The next lecture deals with the spread
of farming in South East Asia. Then follows an interesting lecture on
the spread of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy">metallurgy</a> in
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age">Bronze Age</a> and what the
metals meant to society at different times and places. Another
interesting lecture details attempts to date and size the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_eruption">volcanic
explosion at Thera</a> (now
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santorini">Santorini</a>). From this research
the presenter trys to match up the likely effects with events and
history in the region (mainly the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoan_civilization">Minoan</a> society on
Crete). The next two lectures are respectively on the beginning and end
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Britain">Roman rule in Britain</a>.
Apparently the collapse of the British economy after the Romans left was
particularly swift - previously common pottery and coins disappeared
almost overnight and buildings quickly fell into disrepair. The last two
lectures are on more modern topics - the industrial and the current
information revolutions.</p>

<p>Worth a listen for background information on the timeperiods discussed.</p>

    <p>This is a quick post about a coding problem that took longer than
expected to solve. I have put an example solution here as a reference
for myself or others, hopefully speeding up the task. I needed to create
a dialog to connect to a local or remote
<a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/core/mntr-mgmt/javamanagement/">JMX</a>
process. Essentially this would be very similar to the
<a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/J2SE/jconsole.html">JConsole</a>
“New Connection” dialog. Initially I thought this would just be a
standard component, but instead it took some trial and error (as well as
digging through Sun documentation) to get the required functionality
working.</p>

I could not find a course website.</p>

<p>These podcasts detail the life of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage">Carthaginian</a> general
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal">Hannibal</a>, often considered one
of the greatest commanders of the ancient world. During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Punic_War">Second
Punic War</a> against the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Republic">Roman Republic</a> in the 3rd
century BC, Hannibal led his army over the Alps into Italy. He then used
superior strategy and tactics to defeat the Roman army at a number of
engagements, resulting in the battle of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cannae">Cannae</a> - a devastating
loss for Rome. After this, the Romans adopted many of Hannibal’s
techniques. At the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Zama">Battle of
Zama</a>, Hannibal was
defeated and Carthage lost the war.</p>

<p>The lectures were given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Hunt">Patrick
Hunt</a> as part of the
<a href="http://www.continuingstudies.stanford.edu/">Stanford Continuing Studies
Program</a> sometime during 2007. I couldn’t find a course website, but there are a
<a href="http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/archaeolog/2006/11/alpine_archaeology_hannibal_ex.html">few</a>
<a href="http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/archaeolog/2006/04/hannibal_in_the_alps_stanford_1.html">articles</a>
relating to the course. There are 8 lectures (strangely numbered 1
through 10), all of which are audio only and nearly two hours long
(around 30MB in size). The first podcast is an interesting discussion on
Carthaginian culture, in particular whether they really practiced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Carthage#Child_sacrifice">child
sacrifice</a>.
The second lecture introduces the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Punic_War">First Punic
War</a> and Hannibal’s
father, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamilcar_Barca">Hamilcar Barca</a>.
The Second Punic War is covered over three lectures (along with an
epilogue). The remaining three podcasts are dedicated to Hannibal’s
crossing of the Alps.</p>

<p>It seems Patrick Hunt organises regular expeditions to cross the Alps,
trying to find archeological proof of where Hannibal crossed. Great
attention is paid to how closely various mountain passes fit the ancient
descriptions. Dr Hunt personally favours the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_de_Clapier">Col de
Clapier</a>. If this
historical event is of interest, then you will be well served. There is
not one, not two, but three different first-person accounts of modern
crossings of the Alps in attempts to follow Hannibal’s footsteps:
Hunt’s; Ed Boenig, a student of Dr Hunt’s; and John Hoyte’s, who crossed
the Col de Clapier in 1959 with an elephant (called
<a href="http://www.archaeology.org/image.php?page=0701/abstracts/jpegs/hannibal2.jpg">Jumbo</a>).</p>

<p>Apart from close concentration on a narrow historical time period, the
series has many intriguing digressions. For instance, there is
occasional mention of the meaning of Hannibal’s name, “grace of Ba’al”.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal">Ba’al</a> was the main Carthaginian
deity, who supposedly lived on a mountain. Thus Dr Hunt suggests
Hannibal would have had no fear of mountains. A bit of a stretch, but
still interesting. If you have a particular interest in finding out
about Hannibal’s crossing of the Alps, then this is the podcast for you.
However, there is still much to learn even if that is not your focus
(and the second two alpine lectures can be safely skipped). On the
downside, the first lecture (on the origins of Carthage) seems to be
missing. Also, there is no sign of the lecture slides. Being able to see
the maps and slides would have been particularly useful during
discussions of which Alpine pass most closely matched ancient
descriptions. Nevertheless, don’t be put off by the long podcast length,
this series is well worth a listen.</p>
