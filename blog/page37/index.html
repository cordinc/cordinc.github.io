    <p>This final part of my high-school
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign’s
history starts with the player characters rich, powerful and famous.
While at this point the party only had four members, each was around
level 10-11 and loaded down with magic items. Together, there were few
creatures in the world they couldn’t crush. Challenging the players was
becoming difficult and ridiculous (witness the hordes of hell that
finished <a href="/blog/2014/01/dd-campaign-history-part-3.html">part 3 of this
history</a>). As a group we
took a break for a year and fought the Kafer War in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2300_AD">2300AD</a> instead. Then returned,
refreshed, and reacquainted ourselves with the characters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Raven - a huge brutish warrior with spiky armour to match his
demeanour</li>
</ul>

    <p>Recently we made a quick trip over to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yogyakarta">Yogyakarta</a>, Indonesia for a
long weekend. The main purpose of the trip was a visit to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borobudur">Borobudur</a>, the largest
Buddhist temple in the world. We also ate a number of Indonesian style
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krupuk">prawn crackers</a> and went for a
tour of a couple local villages.</p>

<p>Before travelling to Borobudur we were warned to expect many local
children asking to have their taken photo with us. This was supposedly
because while the temple is a major tourist site, it is mostly visited
by Indonesian tourists, many of who may not have seen Europeans before
in person. I’m not so sure that is true. We got half way through the
site (up to the top) before a flurry of photo requests (to which we
happily agreed). All the requests came from groups of high-school age
children in halting English, and normally with a few standard followup
questions - what is your name, where are you from, do you like
Indonesia? I heard a couple of the kids repeating my answers to
themselves and another taking notes. It think the requests might be part
of school assignments where the children were taking advantage of a
steady supply of foreigners to practice their English. Anyway, if you
visit be prepared and tolerant.</p>

<p>The best photos are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/yogyakarta_14.html">available
here</a>.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I have dropped out of my first
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a>, the
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ggp">General Game Playing</a> course from
<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> on
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>. Having completed half the 8 week
course with a score of 100%, it would be easy to continue. However, the
course is not interesting enough to justify the effort required.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_game_playing">General Game Playing
(GGP)</a> involves
creating computer programs that can compete in multiple, previously
unseen games. These games can be single-player or multi-player; have
perfect or imperfect information; and may be competitive or cooperative.
The resulting players must be able to handle all games without any
internal changes, so are closer to the ideal of generalised
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_artificial_intelligence">AI</a>
than the very narrowly focused computations used in traditional players
like the Chess-only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)">Deep
Blue</a>. The
games are specified in a logic-based language. A Java library is
available to implement the basics of the client/server game playing
protocol and parsing game messages (including the game specification).</p>

<p>Each week the course covers some aspect of writing the players with
30-60 minutes of video - mostly the content of these involve running
through a couple of chapters from the lecturer’s textbook. Every week
there are multiple assignments - some as online tests, while others
require programming. By the end of the course each student will have
created a player they enter into a competition against the other
students’ work. The resulting ranking feeding into the overall grade,
although the details were not available by the time I quit.</p>

<p>To me the course seemed to be mainly teaching their “system” (that is,
the game specification and protocol). A few useful ideas are presented,
for instance Propnets and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte Carlo
simulation</a>. Although,
I had already covered most of these techniques previously. It was like
doing a work course on MS Office or some other proprietary technology.
The course is not worth the time, unless practice in formal logic and
related optimisation techniques is needed.</p>

<p>So I unenrolled and it has disappeared from my course history. This
seems to be a common event. Another recent online course advertised that
it dropped 80% of its students over the first two weeks - apparently a
good result! I haven’t given up on online courses. Right now I’m halfway
through 2 other, more compelling courses (another reason to free up time
by quitting this one), with another starting in a fortnight. Being able
to easily unenroll is a benefit of MOOCs. This way there is no barrier
to give giving one a try. If it doesn’t work out, just stop. Of course
now I’ve quit one, it will probably easy to quit again!</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Some months ago I posted about <a href="/blog/2013/11/computer-gold-rush.html">mining
cryptocurrencies</a>, concluding
that it probably wasn’t worth it. Since then
<a href="http://www.bitcoin.org/">Bitcoin</a> has boomed and then bust, with
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-26446142">theft</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox">bankruptices</a> and possible
regulation galore. Despite the volatility and bad press, Bitcoin has
doubled in value since the original post (although at one point it was
up over 500%). Other, minor, cryptocurrencies have oscillated in value
roughly in line with Bitcoin.</p>

<p>In the original post I estimated that if my desktop PC mined
<a href="http://feathercoin.com/">Feathercoin</a> for 100 days the result would be
224 FTC worth US$15.68 (7 cents per FTC). I left the mining program
running after the “experiment” ended as it didn’t seem to noticably slow
the computer. So now 150 days later the result is 180 FTC currently
worth around US$21 (11.5 cents per FTC). The lower mining rate is due to
not being a particularly conscientious miner and the ever increasing
difficulty of the calculations required to mine successfully.</p>

<p>So what can be done with $20 worth of Feathercoin? Initially it seemed,
very little. There is a <a href="https://feathercoinmarket.com/">Feathercoin
Market</a> of seemingly random items - none
of which interested me. Next I hoped to convert the coins to US$. I
found <a href="https://crypto-trade.com/">Crypto-Trade</a>, an exchange based in
Hong Kong that allowed FTC/USD trades and didn’t charge excessive fees.
Unfortunately, it also doesn’t have any useful cash withdrawal options.
While it is easy and cheap to withdraw various cryptocurrencies, cash
can not transferred to a bank account or even Paypal. It has to be taken
in the form of various east european e-payment systems. Not even the
online poker sites I use would accept them. I looked into methods of
conversion and found various sites charging 5-10% to exchange them for
Paypal, but every single one has pages full of “this is a scam!”
warnings on Google. I then considered converting the Feathercoins for
Bitcoins (or Litecoin) and then using other larger exchanges to get US$
transferred to Paypal. However, the fees for this route would turn my
$20 into less than the minimum transfer amount of $10! Next I looked
into converting the coins to Bitcoin and purchasing Amazon vouchers with
them. Many sites exist to facilitate such transfers. Unfortunately, only
US$ vouchers are available and Amazon has strict policies against non-US
people (like me) using them. Urgh.</p>

<p>At this point the situation was dire, much time had been spent on a
futile investigation of Feathercoin’s utility. The whole system seems a
little “wild west”, with high percentage fees, scams and frauds common.
It is definitely much easier to get money into Bitcoin than the
opposite. I certainly doubt the value of the system as a currency.
Although it has prompted an explosion of witty aphorisms. <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dunning-krugerrand">Dunning
Krugerrand</a>
and <a href="https://twitter.com/The_Pocius/status/435568115791826945">this
tweet</a> are my
favourites.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to write the whole thing off as a folly, I found
<a href="http://www.cryptodechange.com/">Crypto-de-Change</a>, as site that
converts cryptocurrencies for UK Amazon vouchers. I exchanged 161 FTC
for a £10 voucher (about 10.5 cents per FTC). At least there is some
result, but now I am more skeptical than ever. I used the voucher to buy
a book by Charlie Stross - <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2013/12/why-i-want-bitcoin-to-die-in-a.html">it seemed
appropriate</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>As it now seems to be an
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/04/funding-circle-update.html">annual</a>
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/06/funding-circle.html">tradition</a>,
here is my end-of-financial year report on <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding
Circle</a>. The peer-to-peer website has
certainly flourished over the past 12 months. Many positive stories
about the site and its competitors have appeared in the popular press.
The volume of loans available has greatly increased. Right now 66 loans
are available for funding, and that is lower than a normal day. The
increase in loans does not seem to be matched by an increase in lenders
(despite the <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/about-us/our-blog/government-to-start-lending-to-businesses-through-funding-circle">government
joining</a>).
Thus interest rates have been increasing over the last few months. Has
this translated into better returns, or has financial stress created
more bad debts?</p>

<p>After last year’s disappointing ~2% return, no extra money was
deposited, so the maths for this year’s return is easy to calculate.
Here is the summary.</p>

<p>Gross: 8.4%<br />
After Fees: 7.4%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 4.1%</p>

<p>Much better than last year.</p>

<p>Interestingly the gross and after-fees returns are roughly the same as
last year. Any increase in rates has come too late to make much of an
impact on the full year results. The improved return is largely due to
net bad debt. The rate at which loans goes bad has only decreased a
little - just under 5% this year by value, compared to just over 5% last
year. However, this year debt recovery has added 1.6% to the return,
compared to 0 last year. The recovery process is slow and these extra
returns are mainly from last years losses.</p>

<p>Funding Circle now claims I have a return of 4.3. Much closer to my
figures than last year. Although, they have added a note to the figure
stating it is the annualised return since joining the site. This seems
about right, so I’m no longer concerned by the discrepancy. The site
also claims I should be earning 5.8, so again my bad debt rate is higher
than “normal”. I made a conscious decision to have a slightly higher
than average risk profile on my loans (by lending to firms with a
slightly worse than average credit rating). Even taking this into
account, according to Funding Circle’s own numbers, I have bad luck.
This is surprising considering how steady bad debt has been over the
last two years. Will it even out next year, or is 5% about the right
rate of deliquency?</p>

<p>What next? For various reasons not related to performance, no extra
money will be deposited. Nor will any money be withdrawn - I’m more
comfortable how the system is working, and it is still better than a
bank. So until next year the status quo will continue.</p>
