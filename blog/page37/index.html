    <p>Available on
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/in-our-time-with-melvyn-bragg/id73330895">iTunes</a>
with a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl">BBC website</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Our_Time_(BBC_Radio_4)">In Our Time</a> is
a BBC radio show featuring discussions on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_In_Our_Time_programmes">history of a single
topic</a> - a
person, event or idea. It has been running for 15 years with over 500
episodes. A rolling archive of the last 2 year’s episodes is available
on iTunes with the BBC website having selected older episodes. It is
presented by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melvyn_Bragg">Melvin Bragg</a>,
an experienced radio voice, and includes a number of subject specific
experts (usually UK university professors). The production quality is
excellent. Each podcast runs to 45 minutes, audio-only, and is a 20MB
download.</p>

<p>The breadth of subjects and regularity of production means there is
normally a topic of interest in this series. The themes are not
constrained to any region or culture (although anecdotally Europe is
most common). Focusing on world history upto around 1000 AD, I have
listened to 15, downloaded another 10, and only time constraints prevent
me listening to more.</p>

<p>The discussion in each episode is clearly directed by Melvyn (often
following his interests) and can resemble an interview on occasion. The
episodes on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates">Hippocrates</a> spent as much
time on the impact of the subject’s signature work through the ages, as
they did on the subject themselves. For instance, reference to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocratic_Oath">Hippocratic Oath</a> on
opposite sides of the medical experimentation argument by both Nazi
doctors and those who prosecuted them. Due to time limits rarely does
the talk get beyond the basic outlines of the issue. The 45 minutes on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannibal">Hannibal</a> was unsurprisingly
scanty compared to the multi-hour <a href="/blog/2010/02/hannibal-stanford-continuing-s.html">Stanford
course</a>. Still,
interesting topics are regularly examined and good points raised. I knew
little on the intriguing Christian offshoot/heresy
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnosticism">Gnosticism</a> until listening to
the discussion on it - I spent some time on the Wikipedia page
afterwards.</p>

<p>Entertaining series providing a little information (or an exemplary
introductory taster) on many topics.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>We have been on a few day trips around Malaysia in the last couple of
weeks.</p>

<p>Firstly we did the standard tourist jaunt up a tower to see Kuala Lumpur
from above. However, we went to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur_Tower">Menara
KL</a> viewing platform
rather than the more famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronas_Towers">Petronas Twin
Towers</a>. Menara KL is
shorter than the Towers, but provides a better view as it is at higher
altitude due to being built on a hill and has the viewing platform at
the top rather than half-way up. We went to the revolving resturant and
had an acceptable buffet lunch while the city spun slowly out the window
(allow 90 minutes for a complete revolution) - quite pleasant actually.
This allowed us to skip the queues and crowds. If you are keen for the
view this is probably the best way to see it as the cost is not much
greater than going to the proper viewing platform (which diners can
access anyway). However, while the twin towers are quite pretty, in
general KL is not. Also, the city is still hazy from the dry season, so
the views weren’t the best (see the photo below).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/10048110406/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5327/10048110406_ee35a885f9.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>We also had a trip to the nearby beach resort of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Dickson">Port
Dickson</a>, just 2 hours (with
traffic) south of KL. My first advice is to not go there on public
holidays or weekends - and definitely not a public holiday weekend!
Traffic was at a standstill on the beach road, so we just stopped at the
first beach we passed. The beach was quite busy and I’m not sure the
water was particularly clean. Not a place I will be rushing back to try
again. Although, the banana fritters from street stalls were tasty. I
have heard that the east coast is much better and will be trying that
next.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/10048068244/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5328/10048068244_6e45b12fdd.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Putrajaya">Putrajaya</a> is the government
and administrative centre of Malaysia, about 30-60 minutes south of KL
by car. There was no town here before government departments started
moving - it was built for the purpose. Probably as a result, and similar
to other specially constructed capitals, it lacks a little liveliness.
When we went it was almost empty. There was supposed to be a festival,
but we couldn’t find it. We just drove around empty streets and looked
at the buildings - some of which are quite impressive - until we got
bored and left.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/10048117686/"><img src="http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3683/10048117686_afddcde86b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The complete opposite impression is found in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penang">Penang</a>. There is definitely a
feeling of liveliness. Although the buildings of Georgetown appeared
rundown there was much happening on the streets. We spent the day
walking around looking at the buildings (including lots of street art)
and eating tasty food. The Clan Jetties are worth a look (below left -
houses and shops built on a jetty out into the bay), but Fort Cornwallis
probably isn’t (just a wall and some cannons). The day was ended with
drinks by a small beach as a storm rolled in. Very pleasant.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification">Gamification</a> is a hot topic
at the moment as people try to use the games to engage people for
various purposes. This isn’t particularly new. At high school in the
80’s we were regularly told to play supposed teaching games (“make
learning fun!”) while the teacher caught up on paperwork. The maths and
science games were generally considered crap (stronger students found it
too easy, weaker students declared it uncool). The economics games were
more popular - a stockmarket game and an economy management game.</p>

<p>Part of the economics games’ success was due to appearing more practical
and related to the outside world. However, most interest came from
competition - the games were set up to encourage players to compete
against classmates and even other schools. The aim of the stockmarket
game was to take $10,000 and through buying and selling stocks at the
closing price every Wednesday, build the largest fortune possible. Every
player’s standing was published each week compared to other students in
the class, school and state. The goal of the economic management game
was to have the largest GDP among the players after 15 years controlling
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_policy">fiscal</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy">monetary</a> policy. Each
school nominated a team to attend a state championship (I was on the
team that came just outside the top placings at that championship).</p>

<p>These games certainly stimulated interest, but perhaps not so much
learning. Winners tended to be the ones who gamed the game. They played
within the rules, but knowingly or otherwise, they took advantage of the
simplified reality they modeled. The stockmarket winners always had a
high risk strategy. They bought stocks going up fast (transaction costs
were ignored). Most people with this plan lost money, but with so many
players a few would do extremely well. Students with a more steady
approach made small profits, finished a little above average and were
ignored as the higher performing riskier results were feted by the
teachers. Probably the exact opposite of what should have been taught.</p>

<p>In the economy management game, we quickly learnt that the time horizon
was all important. Keeping the economy steady and safely growing
throughout the competition was a recipe for a mediocre finish. The
winning strategy was a steady economy for most of the time, but then
engineer a massive unsustainable boom right before the end of the game.
Best would be if this boom would peak in the last year, so the
inevitable subsequent deep depression never occurred in game time. At
the state championship my team pumped the economy too late. The winning
team executed the plan with the best timing. I find it hard to believe
this cynicism was the organiser’s intention. Although given subsequent
events in various countries’ economies, maybe they were making a strong
critique of politics.</p>

    <p>Available on
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/roman-architecture-video/id341652916">iTunesU</a>
with a <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/history-art/hsar-252">course website</a>.</p>

<p>Having visited a number of ancient Roman towns and tried to determine
how and why particular buildings were constructed, this series on Roman
architecture was a must watch. It is a complete set of lecture
recordings from the Spring 2009 Roman Architecture course at
<a href="http://www.yale.edu/">Yale</a>. Similar to Yale’s <a href="/blog/2009/12/clcv-205-introduction-to-ancie.html">Ancient Greek
History</a> course, this
has been released as part of the <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/">OYC</a> program,
which has gone sadly quiet the last couple of years (perhaps overtaken
by the larger MOOCs).</p>

<p>There are 24 lectures presented by Professor Diana Kleiner, each around
75 minutes in length (available as high &amp; low quality videos, audio-only
files and transcripts). I strongly recommend watching the high-quality
videos in preference to any other format. Professor Kleiner makes
extensive use of photos (apparently many of her own) and diagrams while
lecturing. Production quality is very high throughout and Professor
Kleiner is a clear and interesting speaker.</p>

<p>Most of the lectures form a chronological survey of Roman buildings from
the late Republic through to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great">Constantine</a>.
Lectures often involve a particular theme in Roman buildings of the
time, which is illustrated by few representative examples. Most of the
buildings studied are in Rome, with a few
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii">Pompeiian</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostian</a> and other Italian
structures thrown in. There are also a couple of lectures on the
provinces. Surprisingly,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> is barely mentioned.
I didn’t notice much in the way of architectural theory, the course
seems more based in art and history. There is the occasional mention of
“the language of buildings” and “dematerialising the form”, but in
general it is possible to enjoy the lectures without a technical
background. Required information like the archetypal layout of a Roman
town, villa, temple or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermae">baths</a> is
explained in the lectures. After a only few lectures a student should be
able to spot a bathhouse in ruins or differentiate between Greek and
Roman temples.</p>

<p>The course also includes a few lectures on Roman art styles - focusing
on mosaics and wall art. At first this seemed a digression. However, as
time progressed it became clear that the Romans imagined new building
styles in art and then later built them in reality after working out the
appropriate techniques and technology. Over time buildings became larger
and more baroque as the benefits of concrete (often clad in brick)
became clearer - domes, octagons, arches and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediment">broken
pediments</a> appeared. Apart from
examining buildings to see how they were used, built and fit into
architectural trends there are also many interesting historical tidbits.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a> is named after a
nearby “colossal” statue (now gone). Buildings completed during the
reign of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius">Claudius</a> often have an
intentionally rough-hewn appearance. Professor Kleiner also provides a
travelogue of areas she clearly knows very well - next time I’m in Rome
I will definitely try out one of her 4 favourite
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelato">gelato</a> places.</p>

<p>This is a great course on Roman buildings and well worth the time. It
makes me wish I could have studied something like this at university.
Even the major assignment looked interesting - design a Roman town!</p>

    <p>Last week I went a little snap happy at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siem_Reap">Siem
Reap</a> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia">Cambodia</a> - the town nearest the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor">Angkor ruins</a> (and a short flight
from Kuala Lumpur). The Khmer Empire based at Angkor existed for around
600 years starting in the 9th century. Unfortunately most of their
cities were built in wood and so no longer exist in recognisable form.
Stone was reserved for the gods, so their immense Hindu and Buddhist
temples are still viewable (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat">Angkor
Wat</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Thom">Angkor
Thom</a>) - once they have been
reclaimed from the ever-encroaching jungle. Interestingly, this is the
first place I have been where most of the tourists were not westerners -
large tour groups from various Asian nations were clearly in the
majority.</p>

<p>The best of the hundreds of photos I took are available as a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157635353905769/show/">slideshow
