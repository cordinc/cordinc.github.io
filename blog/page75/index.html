  <div class="content">
    <p>I’ve been playing a little poker since <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/02/last-online-poker-update.html">my earlier decision not to play
seriously</a> - not much, just a few games now and again. I lost a little, then won a
lot, stayed steady for a bit and now I’m on another losing streak. One
thing I’ve learnt is that I’m a worse tilter than I thought. I lose most
of my games the same way. It seems to be a mental issue and it’s driving
me crazy. It would be easy to handle if I thought it was just bad luck
or my opponent was a better player.</p>

<p>Here is an example from early in a $2.20 heads-up tournament, too early
to get a good read on my opponent.<br />
Board:<br />
Me (BB): $1,440<br />
Them (Button): $1,560</p>

<p>Dealt to me: 10 7 off</p>

<p>Pre-flop:<br />
They raise to $60, I call $40<br />
[At this early stage I’m not sure what they could have, but probably a
pocket pair or Ax. I decide to call and just see. If I miss the flop I’d
probably check-fold]</p>

<p>Flop: ($120) Q 10 7<br />
I bet $80, they call $80<br />
[Oh yeah, I was feeling good here. Pretty sure I had the better hand.]</p>

<p>Turn: ($280) K<br />
I bet $200, they call $200<br />
[Now I’m getting a little worried. Ax has a straight draw and the
chance of trips or a higher two pair are increased. However, I still
think I’m ahead]</p>

<p>River: ($680) J</p>

<p>At this point any Ax hand has made a straight. Chances are I’m probably
behind. A bet could be justified just to see if there is any resistance,
but it would have to be fairly large in terms of my stack. Probably the
worst possible action is to go all-in. In that situation my opponent
would probably fold if I was ahead and call if I was behind.</p>

<p>I went all-in, they had A9s and the game was over. I knew going all-in
was a bad decision before I did it, but that didn’t stop me. Why? This
is an egregious example, but certainly not an isolated example. I do
this all the time. Just a few days earlier I was in a 3000 person
tournament (it was free to enter) where the top 10% won money. After
playing very well for over an hour there were 360 players left - a
number decreasing at a 5/minute rate. With a nearly 30BB stack, I had
over double the average. I could probably have just walked away from my
laptop and still made the money. Instead I blew it all in 3 consecutive
hands. The first hand was an acceptable loss, the other guy got lucky
with his 3 outer on the river. The second was bad and the third was
awful.</p>

<p>I’m getting the impression poker is a game of gathering information. You
start with knowledge of your hole cards, but no knowledge of your
adversary’s cards or the community cards to come. You need to gain
information for the least cost and greatest gain - goals which are often
opposed. When all-in there is no possibility of gaining more
information; your opponent has all the choices. Rarely will they call
with a bad hand. There are occasions when it is good to go all in: if
you have the best possible hand and your opponent is still betting big;
or preflop if you have a very good hand and have a stack several times
your opponent’s. In general I think it is a tactic to be used sparingly.
I wrote that last sentence as a note to myself over a month ago, I know
better than to go all-in on what is bearly more than a whim.</p>

<p>If I know better, why do I keep making these obvious mistakes. I have a
few ideas. It could be the thrill of catching a bluff, or it could be a
lack of patience, or trying to dominate a game and refusing to
acknowledge a losing hand. However, I have no problem concentrating for
hours at a time in other areas of my life. I’m aware that my opponent
will have the best hand 50% of the time on average and that luck plays a
large part in poker, so controlling it is hard. Also, I tend to play
well if I’m ahead or grinding out a game. Thus, while all the above may
play a part I think it may be caused by losing interest if the game
isn’t going in my favour - sometimes this manifests itself as an all-in
and sometimes as generally bad play.</p>

<p>I think when not tilting I’m an ok player, but definitely not a good
player. When I read other online posts they are thinking about things
that don’t occur to me during the 30 seconds I have to make a decision
in an online game. However, I don’t think that matters until I get over
the tilt problem and go up a level to better opponents. That is why this
matters to me and I’m writing a long blog post about it. If it was just
a matter of not knowing the game well enough I could leave it. It would
be a matter of accepting the game would take too long to learn well.
Instead, I consider it a personal flaw that I’m not able to stay
rational and maintain concentration until the end of the game. I want to
beat the flaw, then I can decide whether I want to beat the game.</p>

<p>Having read a couple of
<a href="http://www.tightpoker.com/articles/stay_off_tilt.html">online</a>
<a href="http://archives1.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Board=microplnl&amp;Number=12528288&amp;page=48&amp;fpart=1">articles</a>
on overcoming tilt, they suggest: identifying when tilt is occurring;
stop playing when tilting; overcome the origins of the tilt. I can
identify my tilt, so the first step is covered. Stopping play is harder
because when I lose as a result of tilting I want to play more, whereas
when I win I’m happy to stop (is that normal?). I just have to force
myself to stop for an hour at least, which would normally mean I don’t
play again that day. Another part of this is to not set goals around
amount won or games to play. I have noticed my tilting gets worse if I
feel some pressure to play, regardless of whether I am on track to meet
the goal or not. I need to play only if I want to for my own pleasure.
To that end I will not play online for a while to build my interest
again. Lastly, I need to focus on logical play. Reading online postings
to see how other players think through hands will help. Similarly with
reading the hand histories of my own games - it’s a bit like rubbing my
nose in it:) I won’t set any plans or goals around overcoming tilt, just
keep a record of how I perform.</p>

<p>Onward!</p>

    <p>I’ve <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/02/new-goals.html">previously

intend to learn 3D modelling well enough to recreate simple ancient
historical architectural scenes after being inspired by my trips to
Pompeii and
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/12/dougga-photos.html">Dougga</a>. To
this aim I downloaded <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, an opensource
3D modelling program, and bought <a href="http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/product_info.php?products_id=96">The Essential
Blender</a>.
After having read the first 3 chapters of that book and a few online
tutorials (mainly around materials and textures), I was ready to try
creating my first model. I decided upon a sculpture found in the market
square of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozeur">Tozeur, Tunisia</a> - it
seemed simple enough, but it wasn’t immediately clear to me how it
should be done. Below you can see images of the original and my model.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>On the weekend I played another local(ish) 9-hole golf course, the
<a href="http://www.leeds-castle.com">Leeds Castle Golf Course</a>. As its name
suggests it is on the grounds of Leeds castle in Kent. I had hoped that
after the round we would be able to walk around the castle grounds, but
unfortunately the course is in a physically separate section of the
grounds so that wasn’t possible. There are two separate entrances, one
for the castle and one for golf. In any case with the scenery of a
renovated moated medieval castle visible from most holes, I can say this
is easily the prettiest golf course I’ve played. It is a good thing it
has good views, because I played the worst golf of my life on this
course. I lost about 8 balls. I’m not sure if it was just a bad day or
the course layout. However, there are a good collection of water hazards
and bunkers. Also, the rough is really rough - shin high grass that
easily hides a wayward ball.</p>

<p>It is a par 33, 2681 yard, 9 hole course. Three par 3s and the rest par 4. It cost £19.50 for a weekend round plus hiring a decent set of clubs.
Less on weekdays. The website states that booking is essential on
weekends, but phoning a few days in advance I got the tee time of my
choice and the course didn’t seem too packed. There are few facilities
other than a pro shop, but there is a nice pub right outside the
entrance. I’d play again, but maybe after a few lessons.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Software Project Management.html">Software Project Management</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I got in a drunken conversation with another long time
developer and consultant about what makes software projects succeed. We
both had many years of experience with many different projects, so it
was particularly gratifying that we largely agreed with each other (or
was that the alcohol?). Having seen many people write their
prescriptions to project success, I thought I’d add my 2 cents in the
form of my observations. I would consider project success to be that the
software is delivered, the clients are satisfied with the result and
there were no surprises on time or budget (time/budget could be higher
than initially planned, but any slippage was identified and explained
well in advance). As a technical person, I also include the subjective
measure that the codebase would not cause embarrassment (no
<a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">WTFs</a> here).</p>

<p>Below are the some characteristics of successful projects I have seen,
in no particular order. None of them is sufficient by themselves and
I’ve seen projects succeed when some of these characteristics were
glaringly absent. However, I can’t remember seeing any project succeed
without more than a few of these present.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good People. If not the most factor important for success, certainly
the most important for enjoyment. I actually think that smart,
motivated people who want to get things done can ameliorate many
project difficulties. Thus forming a team of good developers should
be the first goal of any project. Note here I haven’t said “Smart
People”. While being smart certainly helps it’s is not everything (I
have a little disagreement with Google’s “only the best” hiring
practices here). On more than one occasion I have seen some very
smart people get tied up in irrelevancies and doing things “right”
resulting in nothing being done at all!</li>
  <li>Political Support or Cover. The senior management have to want the
project to succeed (not always a given in some political firms!).
Otherwise, the project will have problems getting the resources it
needs. Similarly in larger organisations a project needs to have
managerial support, both in terms of the problem being solved and
the manner it will be solved. I was once at a place where the senior
IT management were all old waterfall process COBOL coders and
distrusted iterative development. There was so much friction and so
many people just waiting to say “I told you so” (on both sides) that
forward movement was difficult. At another place with similarly
minded senior management, our immediate manager provided us with
cover. To higher management he presented reports conforming to their
waterfall style, but allowed us to run the project as we saw fit.</li>
  <li>Well Understood Problem. The more similar the problem being solved
is to previous problems the team has solved the more effectively
pitfalls will be avoided. This is one of the premises behind
prototyping - solve the exact same problem twice and the second time
should be much easier.</li>
  <li>Tight Iterations with End-user Interaction. I started commercial
work just as iterative development was becoming popular (we were
taught waterfall at university) and I’m a big believer. I have found
iterations lasting just a week or so (or as short as possible while
still getting some decent work in each iteration) and then deployed
to an environment where an end-user can see it (and hopefully try it
out) work best. The idea is to get regular and high quality feedback
on whether the project is heading in the right direction as well as
priorities for future work and changes required. Every project I
have been on has significantly changed requirements from start to
end. The chances for project success are greatly enhanced if change
is accepted and handled. Indeed the best option is to proactively
seek out the changes required and this is where short iterations
with user feedback help immensely.</li>
  <li>Small Teams. I was once on a project with over 100 other technical
people. The back and forth of meetings and coordination was
inordinately complex. I think Brooks had this right in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical
Man Month</a>, and
teams should be kept no larger than around 9 people. That number
seems to work well and if they are good people, a great deal can be
achieved. On that 100 person project, I strongly believe that the 9
best people in a single team would have done much, much better than
the other 91 as a team.</li>
  <li>Flexible Process. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/05/contect-in-software-developmen.html">I wrote about this
before</a>,
basically I think software projects work best where they are done by
people who look to understand their environment and can adapt - not
just retrying the same old thing that worked last time (for you or
someone else).</li>
</ul>
