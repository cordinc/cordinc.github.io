    <p>I’ve <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/02/new-goals.html">previously
stated</a> that I
intend to learn 3D modelling well enough to recreate simple ancient
historical architectural scenes after being inspired by my trips to
Pompeii and
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2008/12/dougga-photos.html">Dougga</a>. To
this aim I downloaded <a href="http://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>, an opensource
3D modelling program, and bought <a href="http://www.blender3d.org/e-shop/product_info.php?products_id=96">The Essential
Blender</a>.
After having read the first 3 chapters of that book and a few online
tutorials (mainly around materials and textures), I was ready to try
creating my first model. I decided upon a sculpture found in the market
square of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tozeur">Tozeur, Tunisia</a> - it
seemed simple enough, but it wasn’t immediately clear to me how it
should be done. Below you can see images of the original and my model.</p>

<p><a href="/blender/tutorials/tozeur_sculpture/">The continuation of this post is a set by step tutorial detailing my
methodology</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>On the weekend I played another local(ish) 9-hole golf course, the
<a href="http://www.leeds-castle.com">Leeds Castle Golf Course</a>. As its name
suggests it is on the grounds of Leeds castle in Kent. I had hoped that
after the round we would be able to walk around the castle grounds, but
unfortunately the course is in a physically separate section of the
grounds so that wasn’t possible. There are two separate entrances, one
for the castle and one for golf. In any case with the scenery of a
renovated moated medieval castle visible from most holes, I can say this
is easily the prettiest golf course I’ve played. It is a good thing it
has good views, because I played the worst golf of my life on this
course. I lost about 8 balls. I’m not sure if it was just a bad day or
the course layout. However, there are a good collection of water hazards
and bunkers. Also, the rough is really rough - shin high grass that
easily hides a wayward ball.</p>

<p>It is a par 33, 2681 yard, 9 hole course. Three par 3s and the rest par 4. It cost £19.50 for a weekend round plus hiring a decent set of clubs.
Less on weekdays. The website states that booking is essential on
weekends, but phoning a few days in advance I got the tee time of my
choice and the course didn’t seem too packed. There are few facilities
other than a pro shop, but there is a nice pub right outside the
entrance. I’d play again, but maybe after a few lessons.</p>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Software Project Management.html">Software Project Management</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Recently I got in a drunken conversation with another long time
developer and consultant about what makes software projects succeed. We
both had many years of experience with many different projects, so it
was particularly gratifying that we largely agreed with each other (or
was that the alcohol?). Having seen many people write their
prescriptions to project success, I thought I’d add my 2 cents in the
form of my observations. I would consider project success to be that the
software is delivered, the clients are satisfied with the result and
there were no surprises on time or budget (time/budget could be higher
than initially planned, but any slippage was identified and explained
well in advance). As a technical person, I also include the subjective
measure that the codebase would not cause embarrassment (no
<a href="http://thedailywtf.com/">WTFs</a> here).</p>

<p>Below are the some characteristics of successful projects I have seen,
in no particular order. None of them is sufficient by themselves and
I’ve seen projects succeed when some of these characteristics were
glaringly absent. However, I can’t remember seeing any project succeed
without more than a few of these present.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good People. If not the most factor important for success, certainly
the most important for enjoyment. I actually think that smart,
motivated people who want to get things done can ameliorate many
project difficulties. Thus forming a team of good developers should
be the first goal of any project. Note here I haven’t said “Smart
People”. While being smart certainly helps it’s is not everything (I
have a little disagreement with Google’s “only the best” hiring
practices here). On more than one occasion I have seen some very
smart people get tied up in irrelevancies and doing things “right”
resulting in nothing being done at all!</li>
  <li>Political Support or Cover. The senior management have to want the
project to succeed (not always a given in some political firms!).
Otherwise, the project will have problems getting the resources it
needs. Similarly in larger organisations a project needs to have
managerial support, both in terms of the problem being solved and
the manner it will be solved. I was once at a place where the senior
IT management were all old waterfall process COBOL coders and
distrusted iterative development. There was so much friction and so
many people just waiting to say “I told you so” (on both sides) that
forward movement was difficult. At another place with similarly
minded senior management, our immediate manager provided us with
cover. To higher management he presented reports conforming to their
waterfall style, but allowed us to run the project as we saw fit.</li>
  <li>Well Understood Problem. The more similar the problem being solved
is to previous problems the team has solved the more effectively
pitfalls will be avoided. This is one of the premises behind
prototyping - solve the exact same problem twice and the second time
should be much easier.</li>
  <li>Tight Iterations with End-user Interaction. I started commercial
work just as iterative development was becoming popular (we were
taught waterfall at university) and I’m a big believer. I have found
iterations lasting just a week or so (or as short as possible while
still getting some decent work in each iteration) and then deployed
to an environment where an end-user can see it (and hopefully try it
out) work best. The idea is to get regular and high quality feedback
on whether the project is heading in the right direction as well as
priorities for future work and changes required. Every project I
have been on has significantly changed requirements from start to
end. The chances for project success are greatly enhanced if change
is accepted and handled. Indeed the best option is to proactively
seek out the changes required and this is where short iterations
with user feedback help immensely.</li>
  <li>Small Teams. I was once on a project with over 100 other technical
people. The back and forth of meetings and coordination was
inordinately complex. I think Brooks had this right in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">The Mythical
Man Month</a>, and
teams should be kept no larger than around 9 people. That number
seems to work well and if they are good people, a great deal can be
achieved. On that 100 person project, I strongly believe that the 9
best people in a single team would have done much, much better than
the other 91 as a team.</li>
  <li>Flexible Process. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/05/contect-in-software-developmen.html">I wrote about this
before</a>,
basically I think software projects work best where they are done by
people who look to understand their environment and can adapt - not
just retrying the same old thing that worked last time (for you or
someone else).</li>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I’ve been coding hard the last week or two on a secret squirrel project,
thus this blog has been a little neglected. Fear not, I have a few posts
planned once I have some spare time. For the meantime, here is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/After_school_special">After
School Special</a> in
honour of the UK inflation figures announced today.</p>

<p>When I was in primary school there was a strange little fad for a couple
of weeks that illustrated some concepts in supply and demand. For some
reason, I don’t remember why, one student agreed to become another’s
servant. I think the “servant” was Jason, but the “master” was
definitely Ben. In return for following Ben around and doing the
occasional little task, Jason would receive a dollar a day. It wasn’t a
real dollar. Instead every morning Ben would present Jason with a piece
of paper (about the size of an old Australian dollar note, or at least
the best approximation thereof that could be managed by ripping up our
workbooks) with “1 Dollar” written on it and Ben’s signature. Jason
didn’t think this too bad a deal since Ben was the cool kid in class and
getting to hang out with him was a blessing.</p>

<p>After a couple of days this agreement showed no sign of being forgotten.
Instead, Ben even hired a second servant. At this point a number of
other kids in the class decided they wanted servants too, and thus the
problems began. About a third of the class wanted servants, but less
than a third wanted to be a servant. A day’s wage rocketed. Over
consecutive days we started to see handmade $2, $5, $10 and $20 bills
passed around. Some kids tried to make their notes more ornate and
artistic to entice potential servants to prefer their money, which
seemed to work for a bit.</p>

<p>By this stage some of the servants were building decent piles of
worthless paper. There was a constant problem of what to use the money
for beyond servants. Some was passed around as servants subcontracted or
paid for small tasks. Occasionally someone might swap sides to get or
spend cash. However, people were beginning to lose interest in the
concept. There wasn’t much of an economy until Jason (definitely him
this time) starting making rings. By a ring I mean wire soldered into a
small loop with a shard of glass at the join. With this innovation a
whole range of backyard jewellery was produced, most of the class got
involved as master, servant, jeweller or consumer. Some people from
other classes joined in too. Prices continued their rise for another
week or so but at a less frenzied pace as people were hitting the limits
of being able make money by hand (strangely no one thought of producing
a note with greater than $100 face value, the largest real Australian
note available at the time). Then people began to print money.</p>

<p>Literally print money. I went round Ben’s place one Sunday (he lived
just round the corner) and he had obtained a toy printing press and
paper guillotine. With each crank he produced six $100 notes and he was
cranking hard! On Monday he instantly became the richest kid in class.
By Wednesday the economy collapsed and we (the boys at least) went back
to playing soccer and A-Team.</p>

    <p><strong>Update:</strong> The weather_report project and the weather archive is no
more. The effort required to maintain it was too great, for more
information <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/11/the-weather-archive-is-not-mor.html">see
here</a>.</p>

<p>Today I have released my first Ruby gem:
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/projects/weather_report">weather_report</a>,
version 0.0.1. It connects to the <a href="http://backstage.bbc.co.uk">BBC
Backstage</a> weather API and gets weather
observations or forecasts for thousands of cities worldwide. Don’t be
fooled by the low version number, it is usable. However, it can only
handle the BBC weather feed, requires pre-knowledge of BBC weather
location ids and is metric only (all things I plan to fix).</p>

<p>With weather_report, you can do things like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">'weather_report'</span>
<span class="c1"># 8 is the BBC Backstage weather code for London, UK</span>
<span class="n">londonWeather</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">WeatherReport</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">new</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">8</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="c1"># to get the current temperature</span>
<span class="n">londonWeather</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">observation</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">temperature</span> 

<span class="c1"># to get the tomorrow's max temperature</span>
<span class="n">londonWeather</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">forecast</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">for_tomorrow</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">max_temperature</span>

<span class="c1"># and much more!</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>It can be obtained through rubyforge:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="nb">sudo </span>gem <span class="nb">install </span>weather_report</code></pre></figure>

<p>There is also a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/projects/weather_report">website with documentation
here</a>.</p>

<p>I would like to say thanks to the authors of
<a href="http://newgem.rubyforge.org/index.html">newgem</a> and this <a href="http://blog.bogojoker.com/category/rr/">rubyforge
tutorial</a>, both of which greatly
aided in weather_report’s creation.</p>
