    <p>As travel restrictions continue in Western Australia, it is near impossible to get outside the country, and risky to go interstate. So when the opportunity came to get away for a few days, it was time to look close to home. Hence why I spent 3 days in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalgoorlie">Kalgoorlie</a> and another 3 days in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamelin_Bay,_Western_Australia">Hamelin Bay</a> despite having visited both before (but in the 80’s).</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not go camping during school holidays! The camping site in Hamelin Bay was at capacity. I think the spot they gave us was normally a footpath. It was also noisy.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.capetocapetrail.com.au/">Cape to Cape</a> seems like a good multiday hike. Might be worth a look someday.</li>
  <li>The Margret river region has become surprisingly built-up over the years, especially the northern end near Dunsborough. Head south or inland for the scenery.</li>
  <li>The area around Kalgoorlie had far more flora than I remember. It was just scrubby bush and small trees, but definitely not a desert.</li>
  <li>Kalgoorlie is clearly a working city (and very large by WA bush standards), there are few concessions to tourists. Mining clothes are worn on the street. Most of the pubs looked rough, and one even advertised skimpies (barmaids wearly little clothing) - something I haven’t noticed in Perth for decades.</li>
  <li>The train the Kalgoorlie is so slow. The buffet car barely qualifies as such and runs out quickly, bring your own food. Although I like that some of the stops were just a platform and carpark with no other sign of civilisation visible.</li>
  <li>The main streets in Kalgoorlie are very wide and empty. Also many of the old 1890’s buildings are still there. You can get a good idea of what it must have looked like a century ago.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/ham_kal_21.html">available here</a>.</p>

    <p>Last week I sadly experienced another company taking a customer’s goodwill and throwing it away. In this case, not quite (yet) one for the list of <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-of-which-i-am-not-a.html">companies of which I am not a customer</a>, but still an egregious failure.</p>

<p>Coles is my local supermarket, part of a large Australia-wide chain. I am a member of their loyalty rewards program and have been mostly happy with their service over the last two years. They recently started adverting a store credit card through their loyalty program. I happen to be considering getting a credit card (I don’t have one at the moment), and this card met my requirements (most in Australia do not). So I went to to their website to apply.</p>

<p>The first page asked for my name, email and phone number, and detailed the remainder of the process. Reading this page I noticed two things: firstly, that I was missing some necessary documentation; and that upon clicking continue they may use my contact info to follow up the application. I decided to come back the next day with the documents needed. I did not click continue.</p>

<p>Withion a few minutes of closing the webpage I get a text from Coles stating that my application had been saved, and a link to restart it. I thought that a bit cheeky, since I definitely didn’t click continue and they clearly took my details off the page asynchronously. Never mind, I wasn’t particularly upset. However, in the following 24 hours they sent two texts, two emails and TWO phonecalls - all trying to push me into completing the application. Does anyone actually respond positively to this harassment? I certainly don’t. If they are like this before I finish the application, imagine what they would be like after! The last call ended with me stating forcefully (but hopefully politely) “delete all my details and never contact me again”.</p>

<p>While I will likely shop at Coles again, I will never have one of their credit cards. It is also extremely unlikely I will use any of their other non-food offers. I have already turned off all marketing email through the loyalty account. Not that I feel in any way loyal anymore. This week I will be shopping at Woolies.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Remember <a href="/blog/2020/04/new-goals.html">last year’s goals</a>? No? Neither do I, never happened.</p>

<p>Ok, ok, yes I did write down some goals for 2020. However, apart from the first (on maintaining strength) I did not get close to any of them. The running was given up as soon as the lockdown ended as I couldn’t do weights and run without both suffering. I finished 0 game prototypes, as I got stuck turning the first one I did into a full game. Much of that work will be reusable, but still too slow. I managed 7 blog posts instead of 12. Unless fixing up the house and playing games counts there have not been many other activities, but I don’t think that is a problem. Despite, or perhaps because of this failure it has been a fairly pleasant year. The Covid pandemic has not really changed day-to-day life here in West Australia. I have just chilled.</p>

<p>I debated whether I should bother with goals for 2021, but decided a little direction (but not too much) couldn’t hurt…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Maintain strength and aerobic fitness</strong> At the end of last year I massed and then did a strength block. I am now at least equal to my strongest ever and have set new personal bests in several lifts. I am very happy about that, but progress is getting increasingly hard. The last massing cycle left me tired and sleeping badly in addition to near constant soreness. Right now I do not have the mental motivation to do it all again (maybe that will come back in a few months). Instead my goal will be to not go backwards. Also I’ll start running again, just to keep my heart pumping. The old 5km in 25min will be good enough.</li>
  <li><strong>Finish and release one game, then start the next</strong> The current game may not have a proper name yet (I’m using the working title AbstractHexBattle), and is taking way longer than expected at 11 months this week. But the end is near. I had to change a few things to solve some UI problems at the start of the year, but now there are just 3 big tasks (AI, game progression, menu cleanup) left before I can polish towards a release. Should be soon’ish. Then I plan to reuse much of the code and experience from this game to work on my next, codenamed Concealed Intent 2D (geddit?).</li>
  <li><strong>12 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong> Yeah, I’ll write a few.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Here are a few more computer games I’ve played over the last 6 months…</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/72850/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim/">Skyrim</a></strong>: 80 hours of my life gone to the famous open-world RPG - I completed the main story, but waaayyy less the half the entire game content. This game is huge, and a player can have a second job wandering around the chilly land murdering dragons, vampires and other assorted fantasy creatures with an array of weapons and magic. Despite heading towards a decade old this game still looks great thanks to constant support. Story is ok, gameplay is ok, open-world is fantastic! Like GTA4 the pleasure in this game is just wandering around and being amazed at the the world and the immense amount of effort required to create it.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/552590/The_Sexy_Brutale/">Sexy Brutale</a></strong>: Interesting detective game with a cool graphics style. Wander around an evil mansion saving masked party goers from murder. The hook is you only have a few hours of in-game time (about 20min of real time) before the world resets and everything starts again from the beginning. I got about halfway through, stopping once I understood the mechanics.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/435400/Hidden_Folks/">Hidden Folks</a></strong>: Kind of like an interactive “where’s wally”, this game has the player searching for items in slightly animated line drawings. Charming, but slight, it kept my attention for an hour.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/812140/Assassins_Creed_Odyssey/">Assassins Creed: Odyssey</a></strong>: I really wanted to like this open world RPG set in classical Greece. Friends loved it, and the graphics are beautiful. However, my review is the same as for <a href="/blog/2012/02/game-reviews-again.html">Brotherhood</a> - great setting that makes just wandering around a joy, but I found the gameplay annoying and tedious. Wander around the beautiful scenery and fight huge numbers of people - block, slash, block, slash. Not my sort of game, although I am probably in a tiny minority. On the other hand, discovery mode is awesome.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/938380/Townsmen__A_Kingdom_Rebuilt/">Townsmen - A Kingdom Rebuilt</a></strong>: A medieval city builder in a cartoonish and casual style. Spent a few hours playing, but nothing really grabbed me as particularly interesting.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/717610/A_Case_of_Distrust/">A Case of Distrust</a></strong>: Noir’ish interactive fiction where you are a private investigator in 1930’s San Francisco solving a murder case. Has an interesting flat colour style and a decent story (although fairly linear). Only takes few hours to finish.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/205610/Port_Royale_3/">Port Royale 3</a></strong>: Old (and it looks it) trader/pirate sim. Had trouble working out what was happening as the tutorial was poor. Lost interest quickly.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/355680/Overland/">Overland</a></strong>: A procedurally generated, turn-based tactics game on tiny maps where you hunt for resources to survive a cross country journey in a post alien invasion US. This reminded me strongly of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/590380/Into_the_Breach/">Into The Breach</a> and <a href="/blog/2020/06/a-year-of-games.html">Bad North</a>, but I found those games more fun. This game feels dark, claustrophic and as if the player grinding out towards inevitable failure. Thematic yes, enjoyable no (for me). So it reminds me more of <a href="/blog/2016/10/tharsis.html">Tharsis</a> in that regard. A well-made game, but not my style.</p>
