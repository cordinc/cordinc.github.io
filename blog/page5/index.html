    <p>I am playing too many games. I need to do more work instead.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a></strong>:  Interesting citybuilder in steampunk apocalyptically cold world. Build in circles around steam generator to keep warm. Some storytelling elements mean that society building is as important as constructing buildings. All the building and story builds towards surviving a huge and extremely cold storm - very nice, I had to keep playing until I got past this. After that no reason to replay unless attempting harder difficulty levels or scenarios. Above average builder with some interesting mechanics.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://draknek.itch.io/sokobond">Sokobond</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://draknek.itch.io/cosmic-express">Cosmic Express</a></strong> &amp; <strong><a href="https://draknek.itch.io/a-good-snowman">A Good Snowman Is Hard To Build</a></strong>: Series of 3 very similar puzzle games by the same publisher, listed in order of increasing cuteness. The idea is to move components around a greatly constrained playing area in order to construct something (chemicals, train tracks or a snowman). In total they kept me entertained for a hour - maybe longer for people who like puzzles.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://milkbaggames.itch.io/sidewords">Sidewords</a></strong>: Casual puzzle game to create words inside a grid using the letters on the outside of the grid. Clever little idea, but I’m not a big fan of puzzle games or word games so this didn’t grab me.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://trampolinetales.itch.io/luck-be-a-landlord">Luck be a landlord</a></strong>: Surprsingly addictive game mixing deckbuilding and slot machine mechanics. The theme of struggling to pay rent is very loosely applied as you spin a slot machine and receive a payout determined by the wide array of symbols available - many combo off eachother for higher scores. At the end of each spin you choose a new symbol to add. True 8bit graphics. Wish I thought of this. In the end I had to delete it as I know I would play it too much.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://peachykeengames.itch.io/calico">Calico</a></strong>: Cute cat cafe management game with a stardew’esque feel, but a cell shading look. Told me repeatably I should play with a gamepad, that I don’t have. I quickly ran into issues that may be bugs or more likely control problems. Didn’t have the patience, interest or gamepad to continue.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://hempuli.itch.io/baba">Baba Is You</a></strong>: Very clever puzzle game where the rules of each puzzle are spelled on on the screen and to solve the puzzle the player needs to rearrange the rules. True 8bit style (just like I remember it). Kept me interested far longer than most puzzles.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/284830/Clockwork_Tales_Of_Glass_and_Ink/">Clockwork Tales Of Glass and Ink</a></strong>: I was given this Hidden Object game and thought I would give it a try. Simple puzzles solved largely by clicking around. Ok art, but dodgy animations. Not very interesting to me.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/224760/FEZ/">Fez</a></strong>: Old puzzle platformer where the puzzles are often solved by rotating the 2d view to show the scene from a different angle. Great idea, and it kept me intrigued and playing for several hours until getting stuck on a few levels that required pixel perfect movement. Superior game for this genre.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/326410/Windward/">Windward</a></strong>: A decent age of sail trading/piracy game with strong <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realtime_strategy_game">RTS</a> elements. The graphics and gameplay have some rough edges, although nothing unforgivable for a small indie game. Kept going for a while, but just a little too slow and grindy, so I got out before being hooked (as could easily have occurred). I suspect this is supposed to be a multiplayer game.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/231430/Company_of_Heroes_2/">Company of Heroes 2</a></strong>: I quit playing this well-regarded realtime squad-based tactical wargame after an hour. The tutorial crashed on me. I didn’t know what I was doing in the campaign, other than just keep running forward. Maybe that is a comment on Soviet tactics during Stalingrad (which is the setting), but it’s not particularly interesting for me. Disappointing.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Thanks to illness (not Covid) and lockdowns (yes, Covid) I have had some time to game over the last few weeks. So…</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/elite-dangerous">Elite: Dangerous</a></strong>: I have probably played the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elite_(video_game)">Elite</a> from the 80’s more than any other game. I was hopelessly addicted to it in my early teenage years. When the most recent iteration was given away free on the Epic store, I had to give it a try. After a few hours of play it became clear this was a very large game that I didn’t have the time to master. Especially considering that my tastes have moved away from the flight combat simulator. I could focus on the trading part of the game, but I’ve done that before with <a href="/blog/2015/01/quitting-eve-online.html">Eve Online</a> and I didn’t want to go back there. On the positive side, this game is incredibly pretty.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/794540/Neo_Cab/">NeoCab</a></strong>: Pleasant cyberpunk visual novel. You play as a taxi driver, and decide who to pick-up and then talk to them (standard multiple choice). Along the way you discover secrets about how the city works. There is also an interesting little game mechanic where the dialog choices both modify and may depend on your emotional state (as displayed on your bracelet). Short and entertaining.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/en-US/p/offworld-trading-company">Offworld Trading Company</a></strong>: A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy">realtime strategy</a> game with far more emphasis on the economic side of things (in the form of building, trading and conflict) than direct fighting. There is also a simple supply and demand system - it feels like a good start, but under-developed to me. A nice cartoonish art style, set on early Mars colonies, with a very mild sense of humor. Full of good ideas, but the realtime aspect turned me off. I don’t want to rush, and this game encourages at least feeling rushed. I suspect if it was turn-based I would have played a great deal longer.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/254320/Duskers/">Duskers</a></strong>: Control drones exploring abandoned, but still dangerous, procedurally generated space ships in an empty universe. It has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">roguelike</a> feel. It uses a stylised top-down view with realtime controls. There is the impression of a story, but despite several hours of play it doesn’t seem to go anywhere - I suspect it might just be scenery. This is a game that rewards planning and caution. My sort of game and I would probably still be playing it if not for the grind of getting a game going after wiping out most my of drones with too slow reactions.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1046030/ISLANDERS/">Islanders</a></strong>: A casual city-builder where the player builds towns on small, procedurally generated islands and gains (or loses) points based on network effects. I couldn’t see any aspect of simulation, so this is the extreme puzzle end of the genre. My attention waned after a few hours once it became clear I had a choice between studing the puzzle to attempt mastery, or quit. I chose to quit. Fun for a little while.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.gog.com/game/king_of_dragon_pass">King Of Dragon Pass</a></strong>: Very interesting procedural story / economic simulator game where the player runs a bronze age tribe in a low magic fantasy world. The hook seems to be that you have to think like a bronze age leader to survive (and then need some luck to thrive). So its all about status and respecting the completely implicit rules (you just have to work them out). I liked this a lot despite the very old style UI and static graphics (it was originally released in 1999 and it shows). It is still on my desktop and have hopes to return to it and finally win a game!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/646570/Slay_the_Spire/">Slay The Spire</a></strong>: I can’t believe I haven’t written about this game before. A couple of years ago I played about 80 hours of this hugely addictive card battler with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deck-building_game">deckbuilder</a> mechanics, where the player navigates through a series of procedurally generated rooms (usually containing an enemy to fight) to the top of the “spire” (and the final boss). The artwork is simple and cartoony, but inventive and interesting. The game is definitely strategic and rewards thought and planning. There are a huge number of cards, powerups and other unlockable rewards. Luck plays a small role, but the player has many ways to reduce reliance on luck. Most times you know why you have failed, and just want to try again. Recently, I was sucked back in for another 50 hours after the addition of a new main character. I wanted to try it out, then I needed to finish the game with them. Highly recommended, but comes with an addiction warning!</p>

    <p>As travel restrictions continue in Western Australia, it is near impossible to get outside the country, and risky to go interstate. So when the opportunity came to get away for a few days, it was time to look close to home. Hence why I spent 3 days in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalgoorlie">Kalgoorlie</a> and another 3 days in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamelin_Bay,_Western_Australia">Hamelin Bay</a> despite having visited both before (but in the 80’s).</p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do not go camping during school holidays! The camping site in Hamelin Bay was at capacity. I think the spot they gave us was normally a footpath. It was also noisy.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.capetocapetrail.com.au/">Cape to Cape</a> seems like a good multiday hike. Might be worth a look someday.</li>
  <li>The Margret river region has become surprisingly built-up over the years, especially the northern end near Dunsborough. Head south or inland for the scenery.</li>
  <li>The area around Kalgoorlie had far more flora than I remember. It was just scrubby bush and small trees, but definitely not a desert.</li>
  <li>Kalgoorlie is clearly a working city (and very large by WA bush standards), there are few concessions to tourists. Mining clothes are worn on the street. Most of the pubs looked rough, and one even advertised skimpies (barmaids wearly little clothing) - something I haven’t noticed in Perth for decades.</li>
  <li>The train the Kalgoorlie is so slow. The buffet car barely qualifies as such and runs out quickly, bring your own food. Although I like that some of the stops were just a platform and carpark with no other sign of civilisation visible.</li>
  <li>The main streets in Kalgoorlie are very wide and empty. Also many of the old 1890’s buildings are still there. You can get a good idea of what it must have looked like a century ago.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Last week I sadly experienced another company taking a customer’s goodwill and throwing it away. In this case, not quite (yet) one for the list of <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-of-which-i-am-not-a.html">companies of which I am not a customer</a>, but still an egregious failure.</p>

<p>Coles is my local supermarket, part of a large Australia-wide chain. I am a member of their loyalty rewards program and have been mostly happy with their service over the last two years. They recently started adverting a store credit card through their loyalty program. I happen to be considering getting a credit card (I don’t have one at the moment), and this card met my requirements (most in Australia do not). So I went to to their website to apply.</p>

<p>The first page asked for my name, email and phone number, and detailed the remainder of the process. Reading this page I noticed two things: firstly, that I was missing some necessary documentation; and that upon clicking continue they may use my contact info to follow up the application. I decided to come back the next day with the documents needed. I did not click continue.</p>

<p>Withion a few minutes of closing the webpage I get a text from Coles stating that my application had been saved, and a link to restart it. I thought that a bit cheeky, since I definitely didn’t click continue and they clearly took my details off the page asynchronously. Never mind, I wasn’t particularly upset. However, in the following 24 hours they sent two texts, two emails and TWO phonecalls - all trying to push me into completing the application. Does anyone actually respond positively to this harassment? I certainly don’t. If they are like this before I finish the application, imagine what they would be like after! The last call ended with me stating forcefully (but hopefully politely) “delete all my details and never contact me again”.</p>

<p>While I will likely shop at Coles again, I will never have one of their credit cards. It is also extremely unlikely I will use any of their other non-food offers. I have already turned off all marketing email through the loyalty account. Not that I feel in any way loyal anymore. This week I will be shopping at Woolies.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Remember <a href="/blog/2020/04/new-goals.html">last year’s goals</a>? No? Neither do I, never happened.</p>

<p>Ok, ok, yes I did write down some goals for 2020. However, apart from the first (on maintaining strength) I did not get close to any of them. The running was given up as soon as the lockdown ended as I couldn’t do weights and run without both suffering. I finished 0 game prototypes, as I got stuck turning the first one I did into a full game. Much of that work will be reusable, but still too slow. I managed 7 blog posts instead of 12. Unless fixing up the house and playing games counts there have not been many other activities, but I don’t think that is a problem. Despite, or perhaps because of this failure it has been a fairly pleasant year. The Covid pandemic has not really changed day-to-day life here in West Australia. I have just chilled.</p>

<p>I debated whether I should bother with goals for 2021, but decided a little direction (but not too much) couldn’t hurt…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Maintain strength and aerobic fitness</strong> At the end of last year I massed and then did a strength block. I am now at least equal to my strongest ever and have set new personal bests in several lifts. I am very happy about that, but progress is getting increasingly hard. The last massing cycle left me tired and sleeping badly in addition to near constant soreness. Right now I do not have the mental motivation to do it all again (maybe that will come back in a few months). Instead my goal will be to not go backwards. Also I’ll start running again, just to keep my heart pumping. The old 5km in 25min will be good enough.</li>
  <li><strong>Finish and release one game, then start the next</strong> The current game may not have a proper name yet (I’m using the working title AbstractHexBattle), and is taking way longer than expected at 11 months this week. But the end is near. I had to change a few things to solve some UI problems at the start of the year, but now there are just 3 big tasks (AI, game progression, menu cleanup) left before I can polish towards a release. Should be soon’ish. Then I plan to reuse much of the code and experience from this game to work on my next, codenamed Concealed Intent 2D (geddit?).</li>
  <li><strong>12 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong> Yeah, I’ll write a few.</li>
</ul>
