    <p>This blog has been hosted by Pair Networks since it started back in 2008. Even before that Pair hosted the cordinc.com domain, although at
the time it was just an single page advertising my programming services.
Now it is time to move. For various reasons, I no longer feel Pair is
the right place. Over the next few days I am moving everything here to a
virtual host, starting with email and ending with comments. I am even
going to try turning comments back on using Disqus. If you notice

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I first encountered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: The
Gathering</a> (a
collectable card game) soon after it was initially released in the early
90’s. It appeared from nowhere and consumed local gaming stores. Places
that were once the realm of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">RPG</a> and minature
gamers became quickly dominated by card players.</p>

<p>Magic appears to be a costly game - many expensive cards are required to
be expensive, and exactly which cards are required constantly changes.
It is a trap for those with slight OCD and others with a predilection
for collecting - an ever present high percentage of the geek population.
Over a 1000 cards come out each year and the vast majority decline in
value after a couple of years. A habit running to thousands of dollars
per year is easy to imagine. I didn’t play (or pay).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/mtg.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Soon after arriving in Kuala Lumpur, I was walking to my gym and saw a
store called Sparta. Judging by the name it was either a gaming store or
a martial arts center. It was a gaming store. They had board games,
miniatures, some RPGs and various card games including Magic (their
biggest seller). I tried to get involved in the local gaming community,
but didn’t get too far. There weren’t enough other RPG’ers to get into a
game. So I decided to give Magic a go. It played to my weaknesses, like
Poker (I’m not a fast “on-the-spot” thinker), so mastering the game is a
form of self-improvement for me.</p>

<p>After 4 months I’ve decided to largely give Magic up apart from casual
friendly play. I found the game time consuming, hostile to beginners,
and, of course, expensive. The game is hard to learn. There are a huge
number of rules and cards to learn. I still regularly find myself
surprised in play by a previously unknown rule. Also many hours were
spent organising and thinking about my growing card collection (having a
slight collecting instinct this wasn’t unpleasurable). Many people I’ve
met say that the Magic community is very aggressive and rude. However,
this is not the case in my experience. A couple of people were impolite
and everyone is competitive, but that is to be expected. Most people
were friendly. Maybe that is just Sparta, I have heard at least once
person say it draws a nice crowd.</p>

<p>I never bought cards directly. I only paid for competitions or leagues
that came with the cards to play (referred to as “limited” play in Magic
circles). By the end I had spent £120 and had a few thousand cards in a
box. Projecting forward, it is too steep an expense for me. Poker is
both cheaper (for me at least) and more accessible. At this point I
confirmed what I always suspected. Like
<a href="/blog/2012/07/gold-diamonds.html">diamonds</a>, the resale value of cards
is poor - despite regular assertions to the contrary. According to the
online sites locals use to value their cards, my collection was worth
just over £100 pounds. After a public 3 day auction, I sold them for
£50. I am very happy with this amount - it is around what I expected.</p>

<p>Since I’m now in the <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">game industry</a>,
it was definitely worth seeing how this amazingly profitable game
worked. Even considering the mechanic that creates that profitability
(card collection) is the reason I’m quitting. Despite this, the game and
local community is good enough that I won’t completely stop playing.</p>

    <p>Part 1 is available <a href="/blog/2013/06/beacon-technology-part-1.html">here</a></p>

<p>After a year at Beacon Technology I was fairly comfortable and looking
towards the future. Halfway through a part-time
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Business_Administration">MBA</a>, I
had been promised technical team leadership on the next project. It was
the start of a new millenium.</p>

<p>Initially, things got even better. I was given a solo consulting task to
suggest an architecture for a local telecoms firm. They had a couple of
interesting technical issues that were resisting attempts at a
reasonable solution. I spent a few days just thinking about their
system; eventually realising they were trying to solve 3 problems
concurrently. By decomposing the system into its constituent parts and
then combining the results the whole became much simpler. Everyone
seemed pleased and a soon after I started as team leader on a project
with the same telecoms firm.</p>

    <p>Just back from a short trip to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong">Hong
Kong</a>. A couple of days is
probably not enough to see the city properly, but I’m sure I’ll be back
at least once over the next few years.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157634640617077/show/with/9287928989/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5516/9287928989_a0f630999f.jpg" alt="The Bay" /></a></p>

<p>My traveling companion really enjoyed the city, describing it as an
Asian New York. I can see the comparison, it is certainly a high rise,
busy city. There is the impression is something is always happening. It
is also a very walkable city which also has functioning public
transport. We criss-crossed the city looking for a highly recommended
(and elusive!) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dim_sum">Dim sum</a>
restaurant. Eventually found in the third place suggested, the trip
never seemed particularly onerous - the food was good too.</p>

<p>However, I had a slightly different reaction to the crowds - it was too
much. The city itself felt like Oxford Street in London during the
post-Christmas sales - impossible to walk in a straight line or see more
than a few steps due to the weight of people. Kowloon was even busier.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Last weekend some people from the High Commission and their friends went
shooting. We went to <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/City-Square-Shooting-Gallery/131966796850168">City Square Shooting
Gallery</a>
here in KL and spent the afternoon learning how to safely shoot and then
firing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glock">Glock 17s</a> (“law
enforcement’s favourite”) at their indoor range. It was good fun and I’d
happily go again sometime.</p>

<p>The event surprisingly took most of the day. We originally thought it
would be over after a couple of hours, but it went for nearly 5 hours
(not counting transport). Luckily, lunch and drinks were included. A
couple of hours were taken with safety and training briefings. There was
a huge emphasis on safety - and rightly so. They said at least one of us
would be stopped by an instructor aswe tried to turn around and talk to
the group with a gun in our hand - and sure enough someone did (not
me!). After the training it was off to the range.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/shooting_range.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>We practiced firing at targets 6, 11 and 15 metres distant. I found it
surprisingly hard. The recoil was strong and the gun would kick
alarmingly. I was concerned it might jump out of my hands. As a result I
held it ever tighter trying to stop the movement. My hands and shoulders
became quickly tired. After a while I learned to trust I wouldn’t drop
it and relaxed enough to improve my aim. My practice session shots
weren’t very accurate. My eyesight became fuzzy after a couple of shots
and constantly required a short rest to even clearly see the sights at
armslength. There was also no immediate feedback - I couldn’t see where
the bullet was going. Falling back on old archery memories I focused on
a repeatable action rather than a high score and was pleased to see a
reasonably clustered set of shots regardless of the distance.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/shooting_trophy.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Then we had a short competition for the inaugural (handmade!) shooting
trophy - 5 rounds at each range. I adjusted my aim, closed my eyes
briefly after each shot, and regularly relaxed my arms between shots
rather than keeping them permanently tense. In the practice session, my
aim was low and to the left (apparently a strong sign of dragging the
trigger with a rough action). So I just aimed a little high and to the
right. I didn’t expect to do very well - 3 of the participants were
ex-military and a couple of others had been before. Thus I was quite
calm after firing the first 10 rounds. It was a surprise to see I shot a
48 out of 50 and was a long way in the lead with only 5 rounds at 15m to
go. I was much more nervous for the last 5 shots and could feel my
beating heart. I was surprised by 3 of the shots firing as I didn’t
realise how far the trigger was depressed at the time. Sure enough 3 of
my rounds (which I assumed to be the unexpected ones) went low. However
the other 2 bullseyed for a final score of 64/75, just beating the
second place 62. I won the trophy (and bragging rights) which now sits
on the living room cabinet.</p>

<p>After leaving the range with the trophy we had some difficulty catching
a taxi. Many drove past us and one made a strange waving hand signal at
us. When one finally stopped and I got in, the driver’s first words were
“is that a gun!”. I had to give him the trophy so he could see it was a
toy before he would take us home.</p>
