    <p>Available on
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/itunes-u/roman-architecture-video/id341652916">iTunesU</a>
with a <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/history-art/hsar-252">course website</a>.</p>

<p>Having visited a number of ancient Roman towns and tried to determine
how and why particular buildings were constructed, this series on Roman
architecture was a must watch. It is a complete set of lecture
recordings from the Spring 2009 Roman Architecture course at
<a href="http://www.yale.edu/">Yale</a>. Similar to Yale’s <a href="/blog/2009/12/clcv-205-introduction-to-ancie.html">Ancient Greek
History</a> course, this
has been released as part of the <a href="http://oyc.yale.edu/">OYC</a> program,
which has gone sadly quiet the last couple of years (perhaps overtaken
by the larger MOOCs).</p>

<p>There are 24 lectures presented by Professor Diana Kleiner, each around
75 minutes in length (available as high &amp; low quality videos, audio-only
files and transcripts). I strongly recommend watching the high-quality
videos in preference to any other format. Professor Kleiner makes
extensive use of photos (apparently many of her own) and diagrams while
lecturing. Production quality is very high throughout and Professor
Kleiner is a clear and interesting speaker.</p>

<p>Most of the lectures form a chronological survey of Roman buildings from
the late Republic through to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great">Constantine</a>.
Lectures often involve a particular theme in Roman buildings of the
time, which is illustrated by few representative examples. Most of the
buildings studied are in Rome, with a few
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pompeii">Pompeiian</a>,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostia_Antica">Ostian</a> and other Italian
structures thrown in. There are also a couple of lectures on the
provinces. Surprisingly,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvius">Vitruvius</a> is barely mentioned.
I didn’t notice much in the way of architectural theory, the course
seems more based in art and history. There is the occasional mention of
“the language of buildings” and “dematerialising the form”, but in
general it is possible to enjoy the lectures without a technical
background. Required information like the archetypal layout of a Roman
town, villa, temple or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermae">baths</a> is
explained in the lectures. After a only few lectures a student should be
able to spot a bathhouse in ruins or differentiate between Greek and
Roman temples.</p>

<p>The course also includes a few lectures on Roman art styles - focusing
on mosaics and wall art. At first this seemed a digression. However, as
time progressed it became clear that the Romans imagined new building
styles in art and then later built them in reality after working out the
appropriate techniques and technology. Over time buildings became larger
and more baroque as the benefits of concrete (often clad in brick)
became clearer - domes, octagons, arches and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pediment">broken
pediments</a> appeared. Apart from
examining buildings to see how they were used, built and fit into
architectural trends there are also many interesting historical tidbits.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum">Colosseum</a> is named after a
nearby “colossal” statue (now gone). Buildings completed during the
reign of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claudius">Claudius</a> often have an
intentionally rough-hewn appearance. Professor Kleiner also provides a
travelogue of areas she clearly knows very well - next time I’m in Rome
I will definitely try out one of her 4 favourite
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gelato">gelato</a> places.</p>

<p>This is a great course on Roman buildings and well worth the time. It
makes me wish I could have studied something like this at university.
Even the major assignment looked interesting - design a Roman town!</p>

    <p>Last week I went a little snap happy at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siem_Reap">Siem
Reap</a> in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodia">Cambodia</a> - the town nearest the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor">Angkor ruins</a> (and a short flight
from Kuala Lumpur). The Khmer Empire based at Angkor existed for around
600 years starting in the 9th century. Unfortunately most of their
cities were built in wood and so no longer exist in recognisable form.
Stone was reserved for the gods, so their immense Hindu and Buddhist
temples are still viewable (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat">Angkor
Wat</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Thom">Angkor
Thom</a>) - once they have been
reclaimed from the ever-encroaching jungle. Interestingly, this is the
first place I have been where most of the tourists were not westerners -
large tour groups from various Asian nations were clearly in the
majority.</p>

<p>The best of the hundreds of photos I took are available as a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/sets/72157635353905769/show/">slideshow

  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan">Ramadan</a> is the Islamic month of
fasting, where followers refrain from eating during daylight hours. As a
very important part of their faith and culture, I have seen many
otherwise non-observant Muslims perform the fast. When living in
Australia I only knew of Ramadan from TV or books. In Britain I had
workmates and friends fasting, but most of the country remained
unaffected. Now I’m in Malaysia, a multicultural majority Muslim country
with large non-Muslim minorities. How does Ramadan work here?</p>

<p>Kuala Lumpur (and Malaysia in general) is food obsessed - and rightly
so. There is an abundance of cheap, tasty food with Chinese, Indian,
Thai and Malay influences. There are resturants and food stalls
everywhere. Anywhere there is a walk of more than a few minutes to get
food is glaring gap in the market soon addressed by a new roadside food
stall. Quality is uniformly high, I have yet to hear of anyone getting
sick at even the dodgiest popup stall. Eating out is very common. There
seems to always be a few people in each resturant from opening to late
closing.</p>

<p>Ramadan started this year in mid-July and ran to early August. Thus 61%
of the Malaysian population that is Muslim could not eat between 6am and
7:30pm. Walking through a outer suburban shopping area at lunchtime the
affect was clear. Of the 11 food places I walked past on the way to my
gym, 8 were closed. The remainder were fairly empty. One of them hadn’t
put out half its seating. In the city more places are open, probably
only a quarter are closed at lunchtime. Although everywhere is quieter
with less business. A couple of fast food places (while open) used the
time for renovations.</p>

<p>The law in Malaysia says it is actually illegal for a Muslim to eat
during daylight hours in Ramadan. It is also illegal to serve a Muslim.
This means anyone who looks Muslim to local eyes (which means Malay or
Arab) will find it nearly impossible to be served regardless of their
religious status. Similar laws exist outside Ramadan for halal food and
alcohol.</p>

<p>As dusk approaches pop-up take-away food stalls and special markets
open. There are hugely more stalls than normal (double at least) and
they appear even in areas none were previously (for example a curry puff
stall started outside the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petronas_Towers">KLCC twin
towers</a> - I doubt that
would normally be allowed). They all sell food to be taken home by
people leaving work and do brisk business.</p>

<p>One night we went out for dinner aiming arriving at 7pm to beat the
perceived fast breaking rush (reservations are almost never required).
We were too late. The first half dozen places we went had no free
tables. They were full of people patiently waiting for the alloted time
(this was in KLCC). We eventually found a Taiwanese resturant that
appeared to have an order-or-leave policy.</p>

<p>Ramadan ends with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Fitr">Hari Raya</a>
(known as Eid in most of the world). This is a multi-day public holiday
that has been described to me as having equivalent cultural and
religious significance as Christmas has to Christian cultures. Here in
Malaysia it is celebrated with feasts (of course) and open houses. This
is where various people put on free lunches to anyone who wishes to eat.
There are a lot of them. Politicians and local services (the nearby
police station held one) are almost required to provide one, but many
normal people hold them too. It is all open, public and friendly. It is
quite different to the private family only Christmas meals to which I’m
familiar. Many locals have stories of visiting other countries and
turning up to shocked friends’ Christmas lunches unannounced as they
thought it was similarly open.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I first encountered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: The
Gathering</a> (a
collectable card game) soon after it was initially released in the early
90’s. It appeared from nowhere and consumed local gaming stores. Places
that were once the realm of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">RPG</a> and minature
gamers became quickly dominated by card players.</p>

<p>Magic appears to be a costly game - many expensive cards are required to
be expensive, and exactly which cards are required constantly changes.
It is a trap for those with slight OCD and others with a predilection
for collecting - an ever present high percentage of the geek population.
Over a 1000 cards come out each year and the vast majority decline in
value after a couple of years. A habit running to thousands of dollars
per year is easy to imagine. I didn’t play (or pay).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/mtg.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Soon after arriving in Kuala Lumpur, I was walking to my gym and saw a
store called Sparta. Judging by the name it was either a gaming store or
a martial arts center. It was a gaming store. They had board games,
miniatures, some RPGs and various card games including Magic (their
biggest seller). I tried to get involved in the local gaming community,
but didn’t get too far. There weren’t enough other RPG’ers to get into a
game. So I decided to give Magic a go. It played to my weaknesses, like
Poker (I’m not a fast “on-the-spot” thinker), so mastering the game is a
form of self-improvement for me.</p>

<p>After 4 months I’ve decided to largely give Magic up apart from casual
friendly play. I found the game time consuming, hostile to beginners,
and, of course, expensive. The game is hard to learn. There are a huge
number of rules and cards to learn. I still regularly find myself
surprised in play by a previously unknown rule. Also many hours were
spent organising and thinking about my growing card collection (having a
slight collecting instinct this wasn’t unpleasurable). Many people I’ve
met say that the Magic community is very aggressive and rude. However,
this is not the case in my experience. A couple of people were impolite
and everyone is competitive, but that is to be expected. Most people
were friendly. Maybe that is just Sparta, I have heard at least once
person say it draws a nice crowd.</p>

<p>I never bought cards directly. I only paid for competitions or leagues
that came with the cards to play (referred to as “limited” play in Magic
circles). By the end I had spent £120 and had a few thousand cards in a
box. Projecting forward, it is too steep an expense for me. Poker is
both cheaper (for me at least) and more accessible. At this point I
confirmed what I always suspected. Like
<a href="/blog/2012/07/gold-diamonds.html">diamonds</a>, the resale value of cards
is poor - despite regular assertions to the contrary. According to the
online sites locals use to value their cards, my collection was worth
just over £100 pounds. After a public 3 day auction, I sold them for
£50. I am very happy with this amount - it is around what I expected.</p>

<p>Since I’m now in the <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com">game industry</a>,
it was definitely worth seeing how this amazingly profitable game
worked. Even considering the mechanic that creates that profitability
(card collection) is the reason I’m quitting. Despite this, the game and
local community is good enough that I won’t completely stop playing.</p>
