  <div class="content">
    <p>The first post published here was fifteen years ago this month. Now there are 436 posts in total (including this one) corresponding to a rate of 29 posts/year. The result is 2.6MB of ascii text and around 240000 words which means an average post is 550 words.</p>

<p>Since the last similar <a href="/blog/2015/02/blog-stats.html">meta post</a> 7 years ago, I have removed all visitor tracking, so no cookies or comments (or at least there shouldn’t be unless someone is injecting them - let me know if you see any). The site is also hosted for free on Github without logs. Thus it is no longer possible to be sure how many people visit, or from where, or for how long. Although I suspect that the trend is downwards as there are less of the technical posts that picked up organic Google Search traffic in the past and more posts about games I’m playing.</p>

<p>On the plus side, this blog no longers costs me anything (other than writing time). At the start it cost US$10/month for hosting plus my sysadmin time. Then it went to US$5/month + sysadmin as improving technology compared to my relatively static requirements meant I could use smaller systems. Now hosting a few GB of static site is effectively no cost, and certainly no cost to me.</p>

<p>In the <a href="/blog/2008/02/the-beginning-again.html">very first post</a> I detailed my reasons for creating this blog:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“The aim of this blog is to detail my attempts to create a business that exists on more just selling my time as a consultant; other programming projects I undertake; and any other nonsense I think about.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think that last clause has been met :) It has been some time since the last programming post (other than advertising for my games). Most of my days are spent coding, but I rarely feel what I doing is notable enough for public comment. I should probably change that, and just force out some technical posts.</p>

    <p>Why do I do this? Am I a masochist? Time again to assess <a href="/blog/2022/01/goals.html">last years goals</a>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase strength and aerobic fitness</strong>: As I write this, I am injured - a reoccurrence of an old foot problem. So my exercise plan is on pause. This happened a couple of times last year. The plan was to lose some weight and then push for new highs. However, due to injury, covid and other things I didn’t manage to start losing weight until November. Thus I am definitely not stronger this year. I have been cycling regularly (until my foot injury a couple of days ago) so I might be fitter aerobically. Call this one a partial success.</li>
  <li><strong>Finish and release SHD</strong>: <a href="/blog/2022/12/release.html">Done</a>! There should be a patch release soon too.</li>
  <li><strong>Update Common Library</strong>: Done! Or at least done enough to qualify as a success.</li>
  <li><strong>Computer prototype Ci2D</strong>: Nope, not even started (but the plan is to start in March).</li>
  <li><strong>Paper prototype IPO, Ci2D, &amp; maybe one other</strong>: Done! I have decent, not obviously broken, prototypes of IPO &amp; Ci2d. Both could use a few more iterations, but not too bad.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>: Done! There were 12 posts here and 14 on jarrahtechnology.com.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix steps, reticulation, ceiling crack &amp; shading</strong>: Done!</li>
</ul>

<p>5.5 out of 7. Not too bad actually.</p>

<p>I’m not going to be as ambitious this coming year:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase strength and aerobic fitness</strong>: Once my foot heals it is time to get back on track. So I need to be aerobically fitter according to my HRM (currently 39 VO2max) and have personal bests for 5 reps (powerlifting rules) in bench press (90kg), overhead press (45kg), and pullups (102kg).</li>
  <li><strong>Demo quality Ci2D</strong>: Have something good enough to show other people (by my assessment).</li>
  <li><strong>Continue on IPO &amp; maybe one other</strong>: IPO might have some potential. I should keep going with it.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>: Same as last year. Easy but just need to do it.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix the bedroom window issues, fix the terrace drainage problem &amp; build a rabbit hutch</strong>: Some things I’ve promised around the house.</li>
  <li><strong>Paint at least 10 minatures, and have played all my boardgames</strong>: I have taken up minature painting although my skill is severely lacking. I should give it a decent try. There are also 5 games currently in my boardgame collection I haven’t played - I need to change that.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Just after the pandemic started, I used the time in lockdown to start writing a new computer game. Later I stopped because it was a mess, but soon after I started again. Now it is released! Since it was never supposed to be a full game (just an experiment to get things going again) I have greatly skimped on promotion and marketing. Ohh, and the name. It is called Space Hex Duel. It is a turn-based game of strategy and careful positioning.</p>

<p>Here is a short trailer showing off the gameplay:</p>

<center><iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/62viGwySbjk" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></center>

<p>I have put it up on <a href="https://jarrahtech.itch.io/spacehexduel">Itch.io</a> as a Pay-What-You-Want (PWYW) download (suggested donation US$2). I recommend interested people download it for free, and if they enjoy it and would like to say thankyou, then go back and donate. Maybe later I will put it out on Steam too.</p>

<p>All the info on the game is ( or will be) on its <a href="https://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games/spacehexduel">Jarrah Technology webpage</a>.</p>

<p>Now I need to decide what to do next…</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Since the last gaming post 6 months ago, I have cut down a little on game playing, but still played a few…</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/871530/Radio_Commander/">Radio Commander</a></strong> (5hrs):  A tactical wargame where you only have a map and radio to command your Vietnam war soldiers. You find out what is happening via radio reports and issue orders the same way. Adds an element of confusion to what is happening - have I updated the map with the latest positions? Guaranteed that you will make a mistake at least once and called down artillery on your own men. This is a brilliant idea, but just doesn’t feel compelling. Maybe it is too slow? Maybe you are too detached from the action? Worth a try, but I stopped half way.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a></strong> (5hrs): Manage escape artist dinosaurs at an tourist park in this pretty city builder. Seems heavily tied into the recent films, which I haven’t seen. Has the nice idea of needing the player to complete missions for various departments - with any ignored departments sabotaging the park in revenge (where is HR when you need them!). Ok game, but way too fiddly for me. You are always in-motion - clicking something, or just repositioning the camera after it has flown off somewhere (again!). I prefer a slower, more thoughtful builder.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/596970/Sunless_Skies_Sovereign_Edition/">Sunless Skies</a></strong> (12hrs): I have a love/hate relationship with this story/trading/roguelike game with some legacy mechanics (so many mechanics for such sparse gameplay!). A sequel to Sunless Skies, it sees you traversing a dangerous map in a steampunk sky world in a flying steam engine. Better than its predecessor, but still problematic as it is so slow! I played for 12 hours and the vast majority of that time was just getting between stops. I got an hour or two of story, another hour of action, but the rest was nothing happening as I travelled. I only kept going because the story and non-travel gameplay is very good - but not good enough. This game did not respect my time and I have better things to do.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/760650/Hammerting">Hammerting</a></strong> (3rs): This game feels a little undercooked. As a crafting based colony survival game (a genre I generally do not enjoy), it would need to work hard to gain my favour. Short review - it didn’t. In just a couple of hours it crashed twice and the tutorial didn’t tell me much so I could never really get going when it was working. It also suffered from the common problem with this type of game: it is incredibly fiddly.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/874390/The_Battle_of_Polytopia/">The Battle of Polytopia</a></strong> (3hrs): Cute casual 4X game. Played 4 times in 3 hours. Not super deep, but gives a quick hit of gaming goodness. Probably played enough now, but a decent little game.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/235540/Warhammer_End_Times__Vermintide/">Vermintide</a></strong> (3hrs): Online cooperative FPS set in the medieval grimdark Warhammer Fantasy setting where you battle hordes of Skaven (rat people). I had decent fun bashing rats over the head with my hammer. However, everything about this game is built for online play with 3 friends, and since it came out in 2015, there are now no other players. Literally the lobby was empty every time I turned it on. Nice game, but so lonely.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://playruneterra.com/en-us/">Legends of Runeterra</a></strong> (too many hrs, Riot doesn’t tell you): Free-to-play collectable card battler from the makers of League of Legends (Riot Games) and reusing that IP. Has a nice offline single player mode, so no need to fight against real people and all the work of following a meta which that entails. While the game uses many of the modern innovations of computer-bases CCGs, the single player version suffers from some RNG problems. In an online game, if your cards just don’t roll out out, too bad (next time design the deck better). Here (in single-player) you play predesigned decks so when atrocious luck screws you and wastes 10 minutes it is not your fault, but the designers. Otherwise a good game, and the monetization seems particularly gentle, so worth a look.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>This website has moved. <a href="/blog/2013/08/site-move.html">Since 2013</a> it has been hosted on a small virtual server at <a href="www.linode.com">Linode</a>. Now it is hosted through <a href="www.github.com">Github Pages</a>. I should mention I have been very happy with Linode’s service and cost, but their minimum service is still overkill for this simple static website. I continue to use Linode for the <a href="www.concealedintent.com">Concealed Intent</a> game server (for now).</p>

<p>So why the move? Maintaining an Internet facing server is a pain. There are a number of threats and it is just not worth the time in upkeep. Or worse, no support is performed and the server slowly degrades, becoming increasingly vulnerable (of which I am guilty since 2019). With Github all that work is handled by someone else, and the cost is 100% less (Github is free on my current plan, but even if I need to go to the paid plan later it’s still 25% cheaper).</p>

<p>There are some useful side effects of going to Github too. The site uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPS">HTTPS</a> always, without me needing to play around with certs! Also, I changed DNS provider to <a href="www.cloudflare.com">Cloudflare</a>, and so far their free service is great too - they even cache &amp; compress the website so it should load super quick.</p>

<p>Overall, I have been happy with the process and outcome. There was a bit of fiddliness getting the DNS setup due to lag in updates propogating, but that was it for problems. The only issue to solve now is how to handle automatic backups, but then Github is probably more reliable then me, so I’m not rushing (touch wood). Might have to look into moving Concealed Intent too, although that’s a much bigger task.</p>
