    <p>Some more games I played over the last 6 months of 2024.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/758370/Through_the_Ages/">Through The Ages</a></strong> (9 hrs) - A computer version of the well regarded card-based, civilisation building boardgame <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182028/through-the-ages-a-new-story-of-civilization">of the same name</a>. Graphics are simple, presumably to match the tabletop’s physical cards. The game is reasonably complex, and it’s good to have the computer do the calculations for you. Not much else to say. It seems like a competent conversion, but I doubt people will want it unless they already have an interest in the original version.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/510420/The_Hex/">The Hex</a></strong> (1 hr) - A mashup of many genres in service of a story game with many secrets. Hard to define, it is by the same person as Pony Island (which I didn’t like) and <a href="/blog/2022/04/enough-gaming.html">Inscryption</a> (which I loved) - so if you know either of them, this is similar. It falls between those games both chronologically and in my appreciation. However, the genres and tropes it was playing with don’t interest me much, so I bounced off it hard. My advice, start with Inscryption and if you like that, move backwards through the others.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162700/Midnight_Protocol/">Midnight Protocol</a></strong> (3 hrs) - Hacking game. Move around computer networks, run programs to break defences and steal. I’ve played a few of these and find them quite similar. This is a well made, but standard version. The marketing materials tout the keyboard only controls, but I fail to see why that is a notable feature. Good game, but felt too familiar to grab my interest.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">Vampire Survivors</a></strong> (30 hrs) - A novel bullet-hell game, where the player is the bullet hell. The player doesn’t need to shoot, your weapons automatically shoot for you on a set schedule/pattern - just like the enemies in a normal bullet hell. Start underpowered, running away from the enemies, and soon find yourself over-powered, blasting projectiles in a satisfying cacophony of shapes, colour and sound. In later stages the biggest difficulty is understanding what is happening on a very busy screen! But not to worry, because games all finish after at most 30 minutes, then its time to start over. A simple game with plain graphics and sound, but the gameplay is so well designed it becomes extremely addictive. I do not normally like this sort of game, but this is a big exception. A great game!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/">Disco Elysium</a></strong> (2 hrs) - I really wanted to like this chatty isometric RPG with tabletop (ie dice rolling) mechanics. It is set in a strange, but vaguely 70’s world, where you are investigating a murder, while various parts of your mind converse with you. Strange, but slow. I made a bad choice and the game ended abruptly after 30 minutes, so I needed to start again. Then it crashed on me after an hour (and wiped my saves). I didn’t have the motivation to restart and go over the same thing a third time. Showed potential, but not enough to hook me.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1434540/Zoeti/">Zoeti</a></strong> (6 hours) - Fantasy cutesy anime semi-deckbuilder battler where the player collects cards for actions and then draws from a normal deck of cards and uses that to power the actions. It also has a narrative story (although not one I found particularly interesting). An interesting idea for variation on the Slay The Spire system, but is otherwise extremely similar, and not as good (of course Slay The Spire is exceptional!). This feels like a mobile conversion, and some of the UI is clunky as a result. It is an ok game.</p>

    <p>Did you know Neflix has games? I have been a subscriber for years and never played one of their games. Since I am likely to leave their site soon (for a little while at least), I thought I should try a few games before I go. All the below were played on an iPad and the time played is a guess as Netflix won’t tell me.</p>

<p><strong>Immortality</strong> (about 6-8 hours?) - I was keen to play this after greatly enjoying <a href="/blog/2015/07/her-story.html">Her Story</a>, a previous game by the same team. The player goes through the scenes of 3 films out of order to discover their mysteries. Scrub back and forth through scenes and access newly available scenes by selecting objects common to both. The problem is I didn’t know what the mystery was. I just aimlessly went through scenes. Even though a larger story did start to emerge, I never really lost that confused directionlessness. Perhaps as a result, I felt a lot more passive in this game than Her Story. I just lost interest, thinking I was a long way from the end, but reading the plot in online spoilers I had actually discovered most of the story. Interesting and well made, but too clever for its own good.</p>

<p><strong>Game Dev Tycoon</strong> (about 6-8 hours?) - Instead of actual game dev perhaps I could just play a game about game dev? This is a fairly simple and unchallenging simulation game, almost casual. You choose the genre/topic/platform of your next game and it gets reviewed and sells based on how much effort is put into various areas. Then repeat until you go broke or finish the game. If you play games semi-regularly then the appropriate actions are unsurprising, On my one and only game I got nowhere near bankruptcy. It has an indie charm, but I staring losing interest quickly, only continuing to the end to see if something changed or happened (it didn’t).</p>

<p><strong>Spiritfarer</strong> (90 minutes?) - Cosy basebuilder game where the player replaces Charon in ferrying the dead to the underworld. Only instead of a small rowboat, you have a large ship with various upgrades available (including a garden). In my time playing I didn’t ferry a single soul, instead spent my time collecting resources and talking with the local residents between life and death. Very slow and chatty, plus the controls on my iPad were awkward, so it quickly lost my attention. Not my sort of game.</p>

<p><strong>Monument Valley</strong> (1 hour?) - Good looking puzzle game. Not my thing.</p>

<p><strong>Moonlighter</strong> (4-5 hours?) - Pixel graphics, realtime roguelike where after each short run in the dungeon you take the loot back to your store and sell it for money. Or, use it to craft better equipment, but I sold most of it. You can also upgrade your home town and your store - a nice touch. Not too taxing, being defeated just delays you and it’s always possible to escape at a small cost. I found the iPad controls a bit annoying for a realtime game, the targets on the screen were too small when trying to touch them with my fat fingers. A good, almost cosy roguelike (I didn’t know that was even possible!), but started to feel repetitive.</p>

<p><strong>Exploding Kittens</strong> (1 hour?) - Card game translated directly from the popular <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172225/exploding-kittens">tabletop version</a> (which I had not played previously). Has an evil (?) cat theme, trying to be funny. High variance, but very short and quick to replay so that is not a problem - I think the idea is you play multiple times in a session. When playing alone against the AI this was mildly entertaining, but I imagine it shines when played as a group party game.</p>

<p><strong>Terra Nil</strong> (3-4 hours) - A anti-city builder. It plays like a city builder (place and connect buildings on a map grid), but the task is to clean up a polluted site and leave it pristine after tearing down all the buildings previously built. Excellent idea, and its full of nice touches like the animals moving back in (and their happiness level according to the current environment). Again, I would describe this as cosy, is this a theme with Netflix games? Nice game.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>There appears to a common view on various corners of the Internet that current AI is crap, borderline unusable. A subset of those people suggest it will never be “good enough”. This is largely due to the mistakes made by the public-facing generative large language models (LLMs) that Google, Microsoft and other are determined to push on their users. They make lots of maths errors, they can’t count the number of r’s in strawberry, they just make stuff up.</p>

<p>I agree with some of this. Current AI tools are often not being used appropriately, considering a knowledge of their deficiencies and this can create a negative impression of the whole technology. Certainly LLM tools have been put into search engines to soon in my opinion. They need to make less mistakes before they provide an experience equivalent to what we had before. Similarly, why would a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65735769">lawyer use an LLM</a> without checking for hallucinations?</p>

<p>I also disagree with parts too. To me it seems partly a misunderstanding of what counts as intelligence and thus regularly moving the goalposts of a true AI definition.</p>

<p>I haven’t heard anyone suggest, as of today, we have a true artificial intelligence (some people refer to this as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>). Instead there are various tools that we call AI for marketing purposes. However, in reaching this point I have seen many definitions of computer intelligence come and go.</p>

<p>When just starting out in computing, some (non-technical) people would tell me computers couldn’t be intelligent until they could beat humans at Chess or Go. Well those lines were passed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov">1997</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol">2016</a> respectively, but no one considers those systems intelligent in the human sense. There have been goals around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a>, but current systems regularly pass these tests (note that the versions you see online are usually trained to not appear too human!). Other suggestions are that the creation of various forms of art are the mark of intelligence, but modern systems can do that.</p>

<p>Is it good art? I don’t know. I do know AI tools create better pictures and music than I could. I don’t even know how to play Go. My maths skills are better than average, but I still make mistakes all the time. I have been known to speak nonsense and make stuff up. Does that mean I’m not intelligent? If we held humans to the same standards as AI tools, I’m not sure many people would qualify as intelligent. Imagine the dumbest human you know capable of getting by in society. I would definitely consider that person intelligent in the computational sense. In some specific areas computers can surpass that person’s capacities, but in the general case they can’t.</p>

<p>Over the last 32 years that I have been paying attention to the state of the art in AI, the progress overall has been astounding, especially over the last ten. Modern AIs may not meet all your specific expectations, but they are improving fast enough I wouldn’t be confident that situation will remain for long. Will that mean we have a true AGI? I doubt it (but without certainty) as I’m not certain what intelligence is other “I’ll know it when I see it.” It is far more likely to me people will redefine what AGI is (again) and then claim they have reached their goal or haven’t depending on their existing bias.</p>

    <p>It has been too long. I’ve been playing the occasional game since the last set of reviews. Now there is enough for a blog post…</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075740/Banners_of_Ruin/">Banners Of Ruin</a></strong> (13 hrs) - A deckbuilder set in a medieval world where all the characters are animals. It has all the usual mechanics you would expect: lots of unlocks; combo cards; a choice of events; non-combat events; etc. The novelty is from the ability to have upto six characters fighting on your side. Thus positioning becomes important, as does drawing enough cards to feed all those characters. The downside is it can become hard to remember which cards can be played by which characters (I made so many sequencing errors). Everything about this game is well-made and competently implemented. However, it just didn’t grab me. Competent, non-flashy - a good but not great game.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993790/Ancient_Enemy/">Ancient Enemy</a></strong> (3hrs) - solitaire-like card set in a magical dark ages Wales. By the same people as <a href="/blog/2022/04/enough-gaming.html">Regency Solitaire</a>, it is so similar it could be a sequel except for the change in setting. The other new addition is occasional battles where your powers increase as you clear more cards and you can see what the enemy will do next. These battles make it too hectic for the relaxed experience of Regency Solitaire, but the battles are not exciting enough to make me play this, instead of Slay The Spire. An interesting attempt to merge two different genres, but not interesting enough to keep me playing.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands/">Stacklands</a></strong> (20hrs) - Its a deckbuilder, no a city builder, no a survival game. Clever little cross-genre game. Collect card packs to get cards and place them together to create new cards to build a village and keep the villagers alive in the face of starvation and constant attacks. Lots of achievements and goals kept me going past the usual 10 hour limit for builder games. However, eventually it succumbed to the standard busywork problem and so I stopped not far from 100%.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://playruneterra.com/">Legends of Runeterra</a></strong> (too many hours) - <a href="/blog/2022/10/back-again-gaming.html">See initial thoughts here</a>. Played some more of this and even ranked online for a bit. My conclusion is it is a bad game. It is out of my system now. This game has that collect-them-all addictive (or compulsive) drive to collect all the cards. Luckily it is F2P and is very generous with in game rewards (I got to 70% of all cards without spending anything). However the multiplayer version of the game is high variance. There are many high value cards that can easily swing a game. It just depends who draws their good cards first. Thus even the best decks have around a 55% win rate. So many times the RNG is going to mean you are wasting your time from the start - you or your opponent is just too unlucky to make for a good game. It turns into a bit of a grind - like poker, but without the excitement/stress of playing for money. I suspect this is a conscious decision by the developers, I suspect it helps with monetisation. Not a good use of time. Just toss a (slightly weighted) coin instead, it is just as much fun and much quicker.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385100/Insurmountable/">Insurmountable</a></strong> (14 hours) - Climb mountains fighting the elements and a spooky time-loop story events in this kinda 3D roguelike. The climbing itself is ok, but the events on the mountain are fairly limited and repeat often. I understand this might be intentional given the timeloop, but still makes the game tedious. Once I got the same event 3 times on a single climb (no looping in sight). A good idea that just doesn’t translate well into a game (in this case at least). Skippable.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461840/Zenge/">Zenge</a></strong> (30 minutes) - Casual puzzle game of moving shapes along tracks until a picture is revealed telling a story. I got through a third of the game in 30 minutes, stopped, and haven’t felt the need to go back.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>At the end of last month I was in Kuala Lumpur for a wedding. As I lived in <a href="/blog/tag/Malaysia.html">Malaysia</a> for nearly 5 years back before the pandemic, I greatly enjoyed just walking around and eating for a few days. Restoran Kin Kin still has great noodles; Pelitas is a good as ever; and, I remain unconvinced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian">durian</a>. There are a lot more towers in the city now, including a couple of very tall ones, higher than the Petronas towers. Although it’s good to see the KL penchant for skybridges is unchanged. Kampung Baru is being slowly surrounded by high apartment complexes. The old UK High Commission (<a href="/blog/2014/03/compound-living.html">where I lived for a year</a>) is now another set of 3 massive towers, over 60 floors by my count and getting bigger! However, Ampang Mall (where I used to eat an excellent Nasi Lemak) is now a skate park, so not everything is getting taller.</p>

<p>After the wedding I went to Sabah and hiked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kinabalu">Mount Kinabalu</a>. It is an elevation gain of roughly 2200m over 2 days to a final altitude of 4095m, the highest I’ve ever been. Luckily no altitude sickness for me this time (unlike <a href="/blog/2010/11/peru-photos.html">the Inca Trail</a>), but we were climbing at the slow “unfit” rate. The hike was well organised and not too uncomfortable compared to others I’ve done. Unfortunately for three quarters of the hike we could only see the trees around us due to the mist and rain (very common according to the guide). Only once we passed the treeline (and above the clouds) did the amazing views emerge.</p>

<p>Some photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/malaysia_24.html">available here</a>.</p>
