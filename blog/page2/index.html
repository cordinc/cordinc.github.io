    <p>There appears to a common view on various corners of the Internet that current AI is crap, borderline unusable. A subset of those people suggest it will never be “good enough”. This is largely due to the mistakes made by the public-facing generative large language models (LLMs) that Google, Microsoft and other are determined to push on their users. They make lots of maths errors, they can’t count the number of r’s in strawberry, they just make stuff up.</p>

<p>I agree with some of this. Current AI tools are often not being used appropriately, considering a knowledge of their deficiences and this can create a negative impression of the whole technology. Certainly LLM tools have been put into search engines to soon in my opinion. They need to make less mistakes before they provide an experience equivalent to what we had before. Similarly, why would a <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-65735769">lawyer use an LLM</a> without checking for hallucinations?</p>

<p>I also disagree with parts too. To me it seems partly a misunderstanding of what counts as intelligence and thus regularly moving the goalposts of a true AI definition.</p>

<p>I haven’t heard anyone suggest, as of today, we have a true artificial intelligence (some people refer to this as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence">AGI</a>). Instead there are various tools that we call AI for marketing purposes. However, in reaching this point I have seen many definitions of computer intelligence come and go.</p>

<p>When just starting out in computing, some (non-technical) people would tell me computers couldn’t be intelligent until they could beat humans at Chess or Go. Well those lines were passed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_versus_Garry_Kasparov">1997</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo_versus_Lee_Sedol">2016</a> respectively, but no one considers those systems intelligent in the human sense. There have been goals around the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test">Turing Test</a>, but current systems regularly pass these tests (note that the versions you see online are usually trained to not appear too human!). Other suggestions are that the creation of various froms of art are the mark of intelligence, but modern systems can do that.</p>

<p>Is it good art? I don’t know. I do know AI tools create better pictures and music than I could. I don’t even know how to play Go. My maths skills are better than average, but I still make mistakes all the time. I have been known to speak nonsense and make stuff up. Does that mean I’m not intelligent? If we held humans to the same standards as AI tools, I’m not sure many people would qualify as intelligent. Imagine the dumbest human you know capable of getting by in society. I would definitely consider that person intelligent in the computational sense. In some specific areas computers can surpass that person’s capacities, but in the general case they can’t.</p>

<p>Over the last 32 years that I have been paying attention to the state of the art in AI, the progress overall has been astounding, especially over the last ten. Modern AIs may not meet all your specific expectations, but they are improving fast enough I wouldn’t be confident that situation will remain for long. Will that mean we have a true AGI? I doubt it (but without certainty) as I’m not certain what intelligence is other “I’ll know it when I see it.” It is far more likely to me people will redefine what AGI is (again) and then claim they have reached their goal or haven’t depending on their existing bias.</p>

    <p>It has been too long. I’ve been playing the occasional game since the last set of reviews. Now there is enough for a blog post…</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1075740/Banners_of_Ruin/">Banners Of Ruin</a></strong> (13 hrs) - A deckbuilder set in a medieval world where all the characters are animals. It has all the usual mechanics you would expect: lots of unlocks; combo cards; a choice of events; non-combat events; etc. The novelty is from the ability to have upto six characters fighting on your side. Thus positioning becomes important, as does drawing enough cards to feed all those characters. The downside is it can become hard to remember which cards can be played by which characters (I made so many sequencing errors). Everything about this game is well-made and competently implemented. However, it just didn’t grab me. Competent, non-flashy - a good but not great game.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993790/Ancient_Enemy/">Ancient Enemy</a></strong> (3hrs) - solitaire-like card set in a magical dark ages Wales. By the same people as <a href="/blog/2022/04/enough-gaming.html">Regency Solitaire</a>, it is so similar it could be a sequel except for the change in setting. The other new addition is occasional battles where your powers increase as you clear more cards and you can see what the enemy will do next. These battles make it too hectic for the relaxed experience of Regency Solitaire, but the battles are not exciting enough to make me play this, instead of Slay The Spire. An interesting attempt to merge two different genres, but not interesting enough to keep me playing.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1948280/Stacklands/">Stacklands</a></strong> (20hrs) - Its a deckbuilder, no a city builder, no a survival game. Clever little cross-genre game. Collect card packs to get cards and place them together to create new cards to build a village and keep the villagers alive in the face of starvation and constant attacks. Lots of achievements and goals kept me going past the usual 10 hour limit for builder games. However, eventually it succumbed to the standard busywork problem and so I stopped not far from 100%.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://playruneterra.com/">Legends of Runeterra</a></strong> (too many hours) - <a href="/blog/2022/10/back-again-gaming.html">See initial thoughts here</a>. Played some more of this and even ranked online for a bit. My conclusion is it is a bad game. It is out of my system now. This game has that collect-them-all addictive (or compulsive) drive to collect all the cards. Luckily it is F2P and is very generous with in game rewards (I got to 70% of all cards without spending anything). However the multiplayer version of the game is high variance. There are many high value cards that can easily swing a game. It just depends who draws their good cards first. Thus even the best decks have around a 55% win rate. So many times the RNG is going to mean you are wasting your time from the start - you or your opponent is just too unlucky to make for a good game. It turns into a bit of a grind - like poker, but without the excitement/stress of playing for money. I suspect this is a conscious decision by the developers, I suspect it helps with monetisation. Not a good use of time. Just toss a (slightly weighted) coin instead, it is just as much fun and much quicker.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1385100/Insurmountable/">Insurmountable</a></strong> (14 hours) - Climb mountains fighting the elements and a spooky time-loop story events in this kinda 3D roguelike. The climbing itself is ok, but the events on the mountain are fairly limited and repeat often. I understand this might be intentional given the timeloop, but still makes the game tedious. Once I got the same event 3 times on a single climb (no looping in sight). A good idea that just doesn’t translate well into a game (in this case at least). Skippable.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461840/Zenge/">Zenge</a></strong> (30 minutes) - Casual puzzle game of moving shapes along tracks until a picture is revealed telling a story. I got through a third of the game in 30 minutes, stopped, and haven’t felt the need to go back.</p>

    <p>At the end of last month I was in Kuala Lumpur for a wedding. As I lived in <a href="/blog/tag/Malaysia.html">Malaysia</a> for nearly 5 years back before the pandemic, I greatly enjoyed just walking around and eating for a few days. Restoran Kin Kin still has great noodles; Pelitas is a good as ever; and, I remain unconvinced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian">durian</a>. There are a lot more towers in the city now, including a couple of very tall ones, higher than the Petronas towers. Although it’s good to see the KL penchant for skybridges is unchanged. Kampung Baru is being slowly surrounded by high apartment complexes. The old UK High Commission (<a href="/blog/2014/03/compound-living.html">where I lived for a year</a>) is now another set of 3 massive towers, over 60 floors by my count and getting bigger! However, Ampang Mall (where I used to eat an excellent Nasi Lemak) is now a skate park, so not everything is getting taller.</p>

<p>After the wedding I went to Sabah and hiked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kinabalu">Mount Kinabalu</a>. It is an elevation gain of roughly 2200m over 2 days to a final altitude of 4095m, the highest I’ve ever been. Luckily no altitude sickness for me this time (unlike <a href="/blog/2010/11/peru-photos.html">the Inca Trail</a>), but we were climbing at the slow “unfit” rate. The hike was well organised and not too uncomfortable compared to others I’ve done. Unfortunately for three quarters of the hike we could only see the trees around us due to the mist and rain (very common according to the guide). Only once we passed the treeline (and above the clouds) did the amazing views emerge.</p>

<p>Some photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/malaysia_24.html">available here</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Soon after starting this blog I wrote posts on <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-of-which-i-am-not-a.html">companies of which I have been a paying customer, but will never be a customer again</a> and separately <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-i-love.html">companies I love</a>. The first post was much longer than the second. I’ve been meaning to write an update on those for some time, but never got around to it. Now it is time. As always no links to bad companies, they don’t deserve the slightest referral. Also, I’ve probably forgotten a bunch in the intervening years.</p>

<p><strong>More companies of which I have been a paying customer, but will never be a customer again</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Tango - They sell gift cards, supposedly.</li>
  <li>Thomasz Developments - Real estate developers.</li>
  <li>NYT Real Estate - is there a good real estate company? I’ve never found one.</li>
  <li>McDonalds - This one has been on my naughty list since 1999, I just forgot last time.</li>
  <li>Maylands Physio</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Companies which I will try avoid</strong></p>

<p>I am still customers of these companies (although pay them no money), but I wish I wasn’t, and am slowly working to remove them from my life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dropbox</li>
  <li>HSBC - I have one account left with First Direct in the UK, it is still useful, but I’m looking at possible alternatives.</li>
  <li>Microsoft - Only their size and ubiquity save this repeat offender. I am off Windows again (and back to Linux), hopefully that can continue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Companies no longer loved</strong></p>

<p>Neither of the previously loved companies get to maintain that level. No company has shown especially good customer service to me in recent years, so no company gets any sense of loyalty from me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amazon - Continually getting worse. I’d still buy from them, but definitely don’t consider their customer service to be nearly as good as before.</li>
  <li>First direct - Part of HSBC, see above.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>I often hear a complaint that the news from newspaper X or channel Y is biased. Yes of course, but does it matter? Often the same person will follow up with, “so I get my news from outlet Z”, which is some other obviously biased news source. Probably all news media is biased, I imagine it would be near impossible to be unbiased. If you find yourself agreeing with a source all the time, most likely their bias matches yours, not that they are especially accurate.</p>

<p>So if they are all biased, should you just abandon all of them? No, I don’t think that is necessary.</p>

<p>I liken handling bias in news to managing process improvement. It is not about being perfect every time, but about being able to adjust for errors. For example in aiming, you might not expect to hit the center of the target, but there is a process for adjusting technique for improving accuracy. For news or the media, I find equivalent techniques apply.</p>

<p>Imagine you are shooting for the dead center of a target. You miss, people always miss. In the Olympics people don’t get perfect scores in the shooting or archery. The distance and direction to the center is the error (and in this metaphor also the bias). If your attempts are always a little to the left that’s good, you just aim a bit to the right and you should be closer to the result. You want your shots to be in a tight cluster, then adjust your aim so the cluster is where you want it. The same with news.</p>

<p>To that end, you need 3 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The bias to be known - if you are reading about an event you know nothing about in an unfamiliar source, unless the bias is obvious in the text (see point 2) it will be hard to work out what is really going on. Sadly this is very common and you just need to be dubious. In the aiming metaphor, you need to be able to see where your attempt lands. If you never look at the result, then you won’t know how to adjust.</li>
  <li>The bias to not be too extreme - This is often seen in more ideological publications, the result can be intentially misleading and thus very had to adjust for. This publications should just be avoided. While very common it is usually easy to spot. This is like if your shot misses by so much it doesn’t even reach the target.  All UK tabloids I’ve ever read fail on this test.</li>
  <li>The bias to be constant - If the bias keeps changing, your previous adjustments may make things worse. The tighter they are clustered the easier to adjust. If one if off to the left and the next if off to the right, what do you do? News companies controlled by one person exerting some editorial control will often exhibit this, the bias changing to whatever is convienent at the time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Something to avoid are all opinion/editorial pieces. These are mostly written specificially to influence by people not experts on the topic at hand (like this blog post :). Also most culture sections are not that great, same with sports, but neither matter much to me. Definitely keep clear of anything owned and led by billionaires. In my experience they tend to espouse their owner’s interests, which change quickly and easily (so fail #3). I remember one paper decades ago that was fiercely pro-China when the owner had business interests there, but switched hard to anti-China views when those investments failed.</p>

<p>So what do I read? I find the new sections of the specialist finanical media good (FT, AFR, Economist, Reuters, Bloomberg). Because they are unbiased? Absolutely not, they are very biased. However, when it comes to news events they pass the 3 tests above. The bias is obvious: companies, free market, being rich and capitalism are good, anything working against those things is bad. That bias not secretive either. I remember the Economist (back when I read it regularly 20 years ago) explicitly stating their neoliberal bias as an aside every few issues. Nor is it generally extreme as they have an unspoken interest in being roughly accurate. The implicit assumption is that people will make investment decisions based on the news in these outlets, so expect them to be mostly correct, and if not they would lose reputation (a self-declared Marxist first made this argument to me).</p>

<p>I have lived in a few countries and found the government media generally pass the 3 tests too. For instance, I watched the BBC in the UK and SBS in Australia. Both biased, but being inside the country at the time, I was quite aware of the size and direction of that bias. If you are not in country it would be much harder to tell. I can easily imagine that the government media in some countries may fail point #2 if they are more propagandistic and less free. I also used to read the Guardian when in the UK, being well aware of its biases, as they had been the same for decades (a sort of polite, socially acceptable left-leaning).</p>
