  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently had a disturbing revelation. A friend and I were talking
about the book <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita">Lolita</a>, which I
read about 15 years ago. It seemed as if we had read different books.
The broad structure of the plot was the same for both of us, but some
important details were different. Aged 12, their Lolita was
substantially younger than the girl around 15 I remembered. I recalled
Humbert being pathetic and occasionally cruel, but not pathologically
predatory - unlike Quilty. My friend pointed out a number of plot points
I didn’t recollect at all to contradict me. Double checking against the
book demonstrated they were completely right.</p>

<p>Usually I have a very good memory of plots. It was a little concerning
how wrong I was. Then I realised I was remembering the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lolita_(1962_film)">1962 Kubrick
film</a>. In my mind the book had been completely overwritten by the
less confrontational movie (so it could reach a wider audience) and I
had no notion this had occurred. Quilty looked like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sellers">Peter
Sellers</a>; Lolita was 14, but
played by an actress that looked older. It is like I never read the book
at all. Has this happened with other memories too - I have no idea.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Since <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2009/06/tilt.html">last writing about
poker</a> I have fulfilled
my requirement to read a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2010/12/the-theory-of-poker.html">poker theory
book</a>
twice and started playing again. Not too much, but averaging about 2
Heads-up Sit-n-go games a week (about 20 minutes play per week). I’ll
share my results when I’ve completed a few hundred games and the general
direction I’m heading becomes clear as variance evens out.</p>

<p>At present my results are patchy. I tilt badly less often (but still do
infrequently) and sometimes play quite well. I’m better at recognising
the type of opponent I’m facing and (very) occasionally manage to read a
hand. I’d say 90% of the time I play “ok” for the level of competition
I’m facing (micro stakes). However, I will often play blindingly bad
hands in a match I’m otherwise playing acceptably. Here is an example
where I became enamoured of my top pair against a player who had been
playing very tight for over 15 minutes. What was I thinking, so much had
me beaten.</p>

<p><em>PokerStars No-Limit Hold’em, $1.50 Tournament, 30/60 Blinds (2 handed)
(Converted with http://www.handhistoryconverter.com)</em></p>

<p>Hero (BB) (t1525)<br />
SB (t1475)</p>

<p><b>Preflop</b>: Hero is BB with 3d, Ah<br />
<span style="color:#CC3333">SB bets t120</span>, Hero calls t60</p>

<p><b>Flop</b>: (t240) Ad, 6h, 7s <span style="color:#009B00">(2 players)</span><br />
Hero checks, <span style="color:#CC3333">SB bets t240</span>,
<span style="color:#CC3333">Hero raises to t480</span>, <span style="color:#CC3333">SB
raises to t720</span>, <span style="color:#CC3333">Hero raises to t960</span>,
<span style="color:#CC3333">SB raises to t1355 (All-In)</span>, Hero calls t395</p>

<p><b>Turn</b>: (t2950) Jc <span style="color:#009B00">(2 players, 1 all-in)</span></p>

<p><b>River</b>: (t2950) 4h <span style="color:#009B00">(2 players, 1
all-in)</span></p>

<p><b>Total pot:</b> t2950</p>

<p>Results:<br />
SB had 6c, 6d (three of a kind, sixes).<br />
Hero had 3d, Ah (one pair, Aces).<br />
Outcome: SB won t2950</p>

<p>The longer a match, the more likely a badly played hand will occur. I
recently read about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_fatigue">decision
fatigue</a> and I think this
may be partially the cause. Decision fatigue is the idea that after
making many decisions people’s ability to make good decisions
deteriorates. A very interesting concept that applies to many scenarios.
Some salespeople try to bombard people with choice hoping they start
choosing badly. Be aware of how this affects you and how other people
may be using it against you.</p>

<p>This idea fits my poker play. The worst play comes at times when fatigue
is a possibility. As a beginning poker play, I make lots of decisions in
a game. I’ve not yet reached a point where I see patterns and the choice
is clear. Instead I think through nearly everything. In my last game, I
honestly thought twice about folding 72o out of position against a
pre-flop raise (but folded in the end). I can imagine I would quickly
become fatigued. The antidote is to only start playing when I feel
fresh, preferably after eating or resting. Of course the problem I will
will still get fatigued during a long game and then I’ll start making
decisions like playing another game! Hopefully the game will become more
routine and thus I’ll make less decisions when playing. Well, it’s worth
a try.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>TV news programs are increasing annoying me. Previously I have written
about their <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/news-junkets.html">disaster
junkets</a>, now I’m
ranting about their apparent need for argument. It is not so much a
matter of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent:_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media">manufacturing
consent</a>
as manufacturing conflict.</p>

<p>Many Channel 4 News and BBC Breakfast broadcasts usually include at
least one segment where two people with opposing views discuss some news
item. I have also seen this on current affairs shows and Sky News - but
I don’t watch them often (to their credit I am not aware of this being
done on the main BBC news). It is claimed that they are promoting
discussion, but the impression is of a bunch of schoolchildren circling
the combatant and chanting “fight!”. Humans have an attraction to
conflict, and suggesting a controversy may gain viewers. Certainly such
an approach is prevalent on the Internet (witness
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law">Godwin’s law</a>).
However, I hold news journalism to a higher standard than blogs (and I
think they consider themselves superior too). Perhaps the media is just
catering to baser instincts to fight for viewership in an increasingly
competitive news market.</p>

<p>These discussions rarely add any value to the topic at hand. The
participants are in opposition by definition (or they wouldn’t be
invited) and can’t be persuaded by a 5 minute TV confrontation. At the
rare best there is a reasonable logical exchange, although normally the
parties use all the non-logical weapons of rhetoric to win the debate.
Sometimes there is a heated argument and if the producers are lucky
enough to provoke a physical confrontation it can be covered as news
itself! Often the role of the news anchor in these segments appears to
be goading the participants.</p>

<p>There is the idea of journalistic balance, but this can be provided
without the need for argument. Instead “talent” seems more important
than reasonable, logical and most importantly truthful statements. A new
journalist once explained to me that an eloquent, presentable and
outspoken person is better “talent” - that is they come across well
onscreen. This is why the same experts appear on TV news repetitively
even to discuss areas outside their area of expertise. This is used to
advantage by politicians and PR people. Even today it is possible to
find <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flat_Earth_Society">flat-earthers</a>. A
news discussion with them may imply opinions differ on the shape of the
Earth! Channel 4 often suggests viewers visit their website site after a
discussion for fact-checking. I find this strange because I watch the
news for facts, but they don’t have time to present them.</p>

<p>Rant over.</p>

<p>When I first interviewed for a technology job in fixed income, I knew
the “basics” and explained how to do a discounted cash flow analysis to
price a bond. The interviewer smiled and said yes, that was the correct
way to price a bond, but that wasn’t how it was done in practice.</p>

<p>For the last six years I have developed software for the bonds desks of
Investment Banks (usually the European Government Bonds desk). Now it is
time to move on into a different business area. So I have decided to
write some notes on the business and software of bond trading as I have
witnessed it - starting here with the basics.</p>
