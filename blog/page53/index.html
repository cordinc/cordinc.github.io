<p>Modern investment trading relies very heavily on technology. Computers
are now involved in nearly every corner of large banks’ trading
activities - a big change from more manual processes over 20 years ago.
It would certainly be impossible to run a EGB primary dealership without
significant technology expenditure. This post details an overview of the
technologies I saw on EGB desks.</p>

<p>Over my time working for EGB desks I was always a Software Developer,
and software is the part of the industry I know best. Code written in
banks is not especially different to other places, although there is a
difference in attitude. This starts before a person even joins a bank.</p>

    <p>Time for another rant. I recently read <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2011/11/18/clayton-christensen-how-pursuit-of-profits-kills-innovation-and-the-us-economy/">this Forbes
article</a>
suggesting that the short-term financial tools learnt by management
during their MBAs are killing business. Having finished a MBA, I
completely agree. As well as the financial indicators mentioned in the
article, we were also taught to focus on cutting a company down to its
core competencies and thus raising return on equity. Strangely it was
always assumed that management was a core competency. I think this was
related to the teachers attitude towards students.</p>

<p>There was a split in the lecturers that taught us business. Most were
faculty in other departments. We were taught law by a professor from the
law school, accounting from the accounting department, economics from
the economics department and so on. These people just taught the subject
at hand - normally very well. However, the “core” MBA classes
(management, strategy, etc) were taught by the business faculty and they
seemed to have an agenda beyond the syllabus. They saw themselves as
wise men teaching the next generation of world leaders (because business
defined the world). They were Aristotle educating Alexander. One
lecturer of strategy particularly epitomised this mindset. He taught us
to “think like a CEO”. This seemed to be a solitary uber-man guiding the
firm singlehanded and with precise execution - success or failure was
solely his reponsibility. I didn’t like his Randian/Nietzschean
worldview (I got a below average mark - the worst of my degree). Most
students appeared to lap it up. He told them what they wanted to hear -
they were special, destined for greatness and the cost of the MBA was
money well-spent. Other business lectureres clearly held similar views.</p>

<p>I can easily imagine those students that succeeded in business by luck,
skill or most likely both, did come to see themselves as special. We
were also taught that having a strong sense of personal agency was
correlated with business success. However so is believing failures are
caused extraneous factors. Success is yours, but failure is not.</p>

<p>Assuming senior management see themselves as the source of competitive
advantage can explain much of modern business’ more egregious practices.
Huge bonuses, we are the one who make the money. Outsourcing, those
people aren’t needed. Perks, we deserve it. Isolating senior management
from other employees, they have nothing of value to contribute.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>While in Cornwall we visited the <a href="http://www.nathan-outlaw.com/">Nathan Outlaw
Restaurant</a> at the St Enodoc Hotel in
Rock (eponymously named for its occasional TV chef). Strangely there are
two Nathan Outlaw restaurants at the hotel: a two Michelin star
restaurant only serving a tasting menu; and a no star al a carte seafood
grill. Preferring choice we booked at the grill.</p>

<p>We first noticed the restaurant was completely empty. Of course a rainy
Monday night at the end of November in Cornwall is about as off-peak as
it is possible to get. Still it was surprisingly to see it was just us
and a single waitress. Needless to say the staff were attentive, but
they were also professional yet friendly. Two hours later when we left,
there were 8 other diners in a place that could easily handle four times
that number.</p>

<p>I had the onion soup for starters - fine but nothing special. My partner
had the largest and most flavoursome mussels I have ever tasted (but I
only got a small taste). We both had the char-grilled
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_robin">Gurnard</a> fillets as our main
course, with crab sauce (as recommended by our waitress). I had never
even heard of this fish before, let alone tasted one. However, I can
proclaim it tasty! The beautifully cooked fillet had a quite solid
texture (for fish) and had a very slight earthy/gamey taste. It went
well with the sauce. Dessert was a delicious chocolate sponge. It all
came to around £130 with a bottle of wine and service charge - not bad
by London standards. Definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.</p>

<p>Calculating the price of an EGB bond has to be fast. A big bank may have
400 or so European bond obligations and the quotes need to be
recalculated quickly when the market moves. It is possible to recover
from incorrect prices on D2C markets, with their negotiable RFQs.
However, if an executable D2D quote is wrong then the trader will likely
lose money.</p>
