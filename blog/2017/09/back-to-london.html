<h4>Back in London</h4>

<p>So after four and a half years in Kuala Lumpur, we have returned to
London. My first impression? It is cold here. It has been quite a shock
to go from the tropics to a Northern European climate. Plus, it is
summer! Winter is coming, and I am not looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Other than that London seems vaguely the same. It is still incredibly
expensive. The media continues to be full of stories of either impending
disaster or glorious future success - depending on the proprietor’s
political leanings. When we left it was Austerity, now it is Brexit. The
trains are still broken on an alarmingly regular basis for what seem
like nonsense reasons. Companies say nice things and are polite in
public, but obviously couldn’t care less when time to get things done.
People are everywhere, everything seems crowded, everyone is super busy.</p>

<p>Forgotten when I left, but quickly remembered on return: terrorism
motivated attacks are common enough to be largely ignored by the local
populace. Seriously, I have never seen a Londoner concerned about the
London terrorist incidents that dominate the international news when
they occur. If you ever see a news item claiming that Londoners are
feeling scared, worried or “under siege” then they are talking nonsense.</p>

<p>There have been a few small changes too. Contactless payments are
ubiquitous. I tried to pay for my lunch with cash soon after arriving
and got a very dirty look from the cashier as they made an exaggerated
gesture to open the till. It is as if I was an old man counting out
pennies, which I suppose I was from a customer throughput point of view.
There is also a huge increase in the number of “gentleman’s barbers”.
Male grooming is definitely more overt. Hipsters abound!</p>

<p>Overall, I can not claim to be happy to be back. That is despite finding
a job very quickly in an interesting fintech AI startup. It has also
been good to catch up with old friends. I will probably be required by
work to stay in town over the coming months. However, I sincerely hope
this will be my last ever London winter.</p>
