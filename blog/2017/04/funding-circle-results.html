<h4>Funding Circle Results</h4>

<br/><br/>
<p>Another year, <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">another annual report</a>
on my <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/uk/">Funding Circle</a> investments.
Events since last time have greatly changed the UK small business
environment (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brexit">Brexit</a>) and
Funding Circle have also modified their rules. As a result, it is likely
this will be my last report. Before explaining why, let’s see how the
investments performed.</p>

<p>Here are the returns for the last UK tax year:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.3%<br />
After Fees: 7.3%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 7.0%</p>

<p>Pretty good again - 7% much better than a bank, and about half the 2016
return on the UK stockmarket. Apart from a problem one year with bad
debt, the returns have been consistently decent and worthwhile.</p>

<p>So why could this be the end? It is becoming increasing hard to find
suitable loans. This started with the issues raised in the <a href="/blog/2016/04/funding-circle-results.html">last
report</a>, when the site
removed the loan auction system and replaced it with a fixed return
system. This means that loans fill up much faster - especially the less
risky or smaller ones. Thus when I check the site there are
substantially less loans available. For a while this was balanced by
large real estate loans that tended to take a few days to fill, but now
Funding Circle has decided to reduce their number as well. Perhaps this
change is due to Brexit risks? I’m not sure, but it would certainly make
sense to me. The risks of lending to UK business have certainly
increased in the sense the future is more uncertain. Do I really want to
lend to that small manufacturer for 60 months? I have found myself more
hesitant to lend - my required standards have increased.</p>

<p>Over the last year the money left unlent in my Funding Circle account
has steadily increased. Since such funds accrue no interest, as soon as
they reach a significant level, they are moved out to my bank account.
Then it starts to build up again. I just can not find enough loans to
join. By the end of the tax year the account was a third lower than at
the beginning. Again, it is already starting to rise after just a week
and there is a very good chance I will have a negligible amount left in
Funding Circle in another 12 months.</p>
