<h4>Orcs Must Die</h4>

<p>Is it bad to find slaughtering orcs fun? I hope so considering the name
of this fun Tower Defense/Third Person Shooter hybrid is <a href="https://orcsmustdie.com/">Orcs Must
Die</a> (and it lives up to the name!).</p>

<p>Imagine running around the inside of a Tower Defense game - this is the
basic premise behind Orcs Must Die. The player is a War Mage protecting
a portal into the world from a plague of orcs as they rush towards it.
Partly this can be achieved by placing various traps, blockages and
turrets common to the tower defense genre, but it will rarely be enough.
Instead the player’s avatar must usually do some of the killing
personally with their trusty crossbow or sword in standard 3rd person
shooter gameplay.</p>

<p>This combination is a nice conceit and implemented in a fun way. At the
start of each level the player runs around preparing their traps and
then works their way through the waves of enemies. Occasionally there is
a pause to allow more trap placement, but generally the game is
fast-paced. As the player progresses through the levels new traps are
unlocked and old ones can be upgraded. These improvements are needed to
deal with ever increasing numbers and more dangerous forms of orc. The
game is not easy, but neither is it impossibly hard. I failed every
missions the first time I played, but none (so far) took more than 3
attempts to complete (each mission being 5-15 minutes long). Plus there
is always a new way to organise your traps to block the flow of orcs -
many missions can be completed in multiple different ways.</p>

<p>Despite the genocidal name, the gameplay is built for fun. The player’s
avatar makes occasional quips and has an uncanny resemblance to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ash_Williams">Ash
from the Evil Dead</a> films.
Planning out engines of death can be quite entertaining, especially if
they involve flinging the orcs around with spring traps or dropping them
into lava pits. Everything is drawn in a cartoonish style, including the
orcs, and it can sometimes feel like an old roadrunner cartoon when your
traps work well. The victims never seem hugely concerned with their
deaths - lucky because they die by the horde and often up close to the
camera.</p>

<p>Fun and humour are the keys to this game’s success - helping overcome
its deficiencies. It feels lightweight compared to the thought and
planning the best tower defense games require. Similarly the shooter
part by itself while smooth is not compelling. It is the combination of
the two that make the game work - jack of all trades, master of none.
There is little innovation here other than the combination of the two
genres. However, that is all that is required, with a polished and
smooth implementation to create an enjoyable gameplay experience.</p>

<p>Orcs Must Die is available at the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/102600/">Steam
store</a> on PC for US$9.99. It
has been bundled.</p>
