<p>Yes, no, yes, no - how hard can it be to run a fantasy kingdom? Very
hard, and also quite fun in the simple and innovative
<a href="http://nerial.co.uk/reigns/">Reigns</a>. Now dog, what were you saying?</p>

<p>Reigns is like no game I have seen before - a real innovation. At the
most basic level it is a card game, but it builds to so much more. The
player is the king of a fantasy kingdom, having to make decisions on how
to run the realm at the rate of 1 decision per year (usually 1 card per
decision, but sometimes more). These decisions are all binary and
determined by swiping left or right on the card, like Tinder. On one
card swiping left may mean attacking an enemy, while swiping right is
ignoring them. This probably works best on mobile, and the UI is
designed like a mobile layout, but it still plays acceptably on PC. This
is the only way of interacting with the game - simple and easy to
understand yet still capable of a decent amount of complexity.</p>

<p>Decisions have an effect on four stats representing religion, people,
military and money. When leaning towards a particular action (literally
in the gesture mechanics of this game!) the player is given a hint on
how these stats will change with that choice. Although the player is
never certain unless they have seen that card previously. If any of the
stats get too high or too low, the king dies or is removed from power.
Then the game starts again with the subsequent king. The king dies often - there are many reigns!</p>

<p>That is it, but from that simple base comes an extremely interesting
game. Is the aim to stay in power? Or to collect in-game achievements
like seeing all the cards, characters, and experiencing all the possible
deaths. Or just progressing the story which spans across kings’ reigns.
The choices made by the player are remembered and appear to affect the
story beyond the current king. There is a continuing plot line that
carries over the generations. The story elements are quite lightly
applied and story decisions/cards don’t pop up particularly often, but
perhaps that is just the randomness of card selection. Does the
narrative go anywhere? I’m not sure after 5 hours of play. There is a
small and reasonable amount of luck in this game - totally expressed
through card order. More cards are added into the deck of possibilities
as achievements are unlocked.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/agdp/reigns/cards_full.png"><img src="/assets/agdp/reigns/cards.png" alt="Yes or no?" title="Yes or no?" /></a></p>

<p>After getting used to the game, I began to look at the decisions in a
different way. Instead of seeing them as moral decisions (should or
shouldn’t there be slavery?), I just saw them as ways to placate or
annoy parts of my populations (via the 4 stats). It is an interesting
idea that the kingdom should be in balance, rather than the common
min/maxing in strategy games. The first few times a decision card turns
up I would think about the possibilities. I knew what I wanted to do,
but had to think instead about balance. Still after playing for several
hours many of the same cards seem to appear and it can seem a little
repetitive.</p>

<p>There are a couple of little mini-games (duelling and escaping a maze)
that detract from the core experience. Also there is a lack of useful
tooltips, perhaps due to the game’s mobile heritage. Otherwise it is
hard to think of much Reigns does wrong. It is well made. I particularly
like the sound FX. It has intrigued and entranced me for for several
hours - both as a player and a gamedev (thinking about the possibilities
of a card-based binary decision system). I’m not sure there will be many
more hours of play, but for a cheap casual game it has already greatly
surpassed expectations. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Reigns is available on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/474750/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux
at US$2.99. It has not been bundled.</p>
