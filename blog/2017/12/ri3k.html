<p>The shortest job I ever had was just 8 weeks - half of which was serving
out my notice period! It was my “summer job”, as it was just for June
and July 2005. Once my <a href="/blog/2016/09/rbs-2.html">RBS contract</a> ended, a
serious search for the next job began. There were a few bad interviews,
an awful experience with a pushy dishonest recruitment agent, and a
clearly best offer. Unfortunately it did not work out.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Ri3k was a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinsurance">reinsurance</a>
technology firm (it has since been acquired and no longer exists as an
independent entity). It aimed to help bring insurance companies together
to create reinsurance contracts and then manage the result. For the
first few years of the company’s existence this meant working on
intranets for big insurers and consulting on knowledge management. That
funded stage 2 - the development of an automated marketplace for
creating reinsurance contracts and storing them. These contracts would
be extremely low volume (just a few hundred per year if we were
successful), but very large ($100’s million each), and could be quite
complex with a lot of back and forth negotiations including supporting
documents/evidence. The system also had to be secure and secret, both
for regulatory reasons and because reinsurance is a secretive industry.</p>

<p>I started as a Software Architect to design the new system - an initial
3 month contract leading to a permanent position if all went well.
Another person came onboard at the same time as Project Manager (my
organisational equal) to handle the development software team. There was
an initial team of 3 coders to help out in the early stages, but this
was expected to grow over time. The project was an interesting problem.
Just the sort of thing I wanted to work on. Plus it was greenfield dev
and someone else did the people management! The office location was a
small recently refurbished office near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatton_Garden">Hatton
Garden</a> and we had good,
modern equipment. The team seemed friendly and of decent talent. I have
pleasant memories of groups of us going out to lunch together and
sitting in the sun to eat.</p>

<p>So what went wrong?</p>

<p>It was management. I had two managers: one for people management; and,
one for technical management. The people manager seemed like a nice guy. 
He interviewed me and got me excited about the job, but I had little
to do with him after that. Unfortunately I did not get to meet my
technical manager before starting as he was on holiday through the
interview process. Especially unfortunate as we did not get on at all.
He was near impossible to work with. He would change his mind daily on
requirements, what was important, and priorities. When the current task
was complete he would be upset that I had wasted my time on something so
irrelevant. He complained I was making mistakes or forgetting things,
but usually the examples he provided were directions directly from him.</p>

<p>Within a week I had started keeping copious notes on our meetings and
conversations to ensure I wasn’t missing anything. I would double check
my notes after writing them with this manager. Yet still he would tell
me later that I had it all wrong and could do nothing right, even if it
was something directly from my notes that he had confirmed. The new
Project Manager (who was in many of the same meetings) agreed that I was
not the problem, and that my technical manager was changing his mind
constantly and blaming me for it. Then my manager started becoming
harder to track down, becoming increasing absent. This had its benefits
as it allowed to focus more on the work I thought needed to be done.
Although there was also the negatives as when my manager returned he was
even more insistent I was doing it all wrong. A couple of times I spoke
to my people manager about the problem, but the response was always that
he agreed that my technical manager was “difficult”, but good at his job
and close to the CEO, thus I would just need to learn to work with him.
The situation made me increasing miserable.</p>

<p>I handed in my resignation 19 working days after starting, and offered
to leave immediately. This was rejected so I worked out 4 weeks notice,
making 8 weeks total. It just wasn’t worth the pain of working with an
obviously toxic personality. I believe I had made reasonable attempts at
trying to make the situation work, but was met with unreasonable
demands. I had notified management of the problems, but nothing seemed
to be happening. Best just to leave and move on. It was not the easiest
decision to make, as I had no job to go to next, but it worked out
massively to my advantage.</p>

<p>The last four weeks there were mildly more pleasant. My technical
manager was still often absent and regularly belittled me, but I cared
less. On my last day I handed both my managers and the new Project
Manager two documents (not to just my technical manager as I didn’t
trust him). The first was a system design based on what I thought my
technical manager said was required; the other was the system design as
I thought it should be done. Then I walked out.</p>

<p>That winter the Project Manager contacted me. He said that there had
been some changes at Ri3k. After I left, at first the project had
stalled and could not get moving for several months. Then my old
technical manager had resigned and not replaced (it was suggested he was
forced out). Since then they had gone back to my old personal design
document and started again from the beginning using it. He said it was
going well so far, and they would really like it if I returned as
Software Architect. I declined. Things were going well at my new job and
I didn’t feel any need to go back to a place with bad memories. Still it
was nice to have confirmation that it was my manager who was the problem
and I did a good job, if only for a short time.</p>

<p>Some notes from my 8 weeks:</p>

<ul>
  <li>This is the only contract I have had where there was a serious
difficulty with the recruitment agent. It took several months after
leaving and many pestering calls before I was completely paid for
all the time I worked.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers">De Beers</a> London office
was just around the corner from ours. They had a heliport on top of
the building and we could hear the CEO arrive and leave every day
(normally 10-4, short day).</li>
  <li>For my first 2 days on the job there was only me and and
receptionist in the office. Everyone else was off at a corporate
paintball camp. I just spent those days reading documents.</li>
  <li>During my time here Google came out with their Maps web
application - the first web app that could update content on a web
page without requiring the whole page to be updated (you could drag
the map area around and only the map itself would update). This was
a big deal in web development and all the dev people gathered around
to see how it was done. Once we had worked it out, my technical
manager declared it easy, unimpressive and something he could do in
a few hours. I saw at least a couple of people roll their eyes.</li>
  <li>While doing some prototyping I made my (so far) only contribution to
an existing open source project, providing a bugfix to
<a href="http://c-jdbc.ow2.org/">C-JDBC</a>, a now inactive Java database
clustering library (see the <a href="http://c-jdbc.ow2.org/current/doc/HISTORY.txt">release notes for version
1.3.1</a>).</li>
</ul>
