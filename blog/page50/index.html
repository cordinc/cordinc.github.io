    <p>Available from
<a href="http://itunes.apple.com/gb/itunes-u/archaeology/id394588178">iTunes</a> or
from the <a href="http://www.latrobe.edu.au/news/podcasts">La Trobe University Podcasts
page</a> (but they will have to be
found individually as there does not appear to be a series webpage).</p>

<p>This is a series of talks and interviews from the La Trobe University
Archaeology department. The topics vary wildly, from the traditional
Ancient Egypt and Cyprus, to relatively modern digs in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne">Melbourne
city</a> (founded in 1835). As the
series is archaeologically focussed there is more emphasis on the
extraction and identification of objects than history. At present there
are 12 episodes - 2 are short videos (around 3 minutes) and the
remainder are audio only. Two of the audio podcasts are hour long
scholarly presentations, while the other 8 are interviews of between 15
to 20 minutes duration. There may be more episodes in the series as the
entries so far have trickled in over the last 2 years. Production
quality is high for the whole series.</p>

<p>There are two podcasts on archaeology in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania">Oceania</a>, particularly
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii">Hawaii</a>. One is an academic
presentation, while the other is an interview with the same presenter on
the same topic. There is some talk on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse:_How_Societies_Choose_to_Fail_or_Succeed">Jared
Diamond’s Collapse book</a>. Diamond suggests that society on the
Polynesian island <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangareva">Mangareva</a>
due to overforestation. However, the presenter’s research suggests
instead that the deforestation was caused by a lack of phosphorus in the
soil due to the killing of sea birds. The discussion of Hawaii is
similarly focussed on the affect of intensive cultivation on soil
quality. Unsurprisingly the indigenous people started agriculture on the
best land and as population grew, expanded out to less productive land.
Once all arable areas were cultivated, the land became more subdivided
and population growth slowed. Also there is evidence of political
consolidation beginning around the same time.</p>

<p>Another paired presentation and interview discuss excavations at the
ancient Egyptian capital
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhetaton">Amarna</a>. They are focussed on
the industry of the time - in particular small metal work and glazed
pottery. Details of the materials used are probed with
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchrotron">synchrotrons</a> and a bit of
experimental archaeology is conducted to determine the techniques used
to manufacture them.</p>

<p>Another episode details the search for ships lost in Vietnam by the
Chinese emperor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kublai_Khan">Kublai Khan</a>
at the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_B%E1%BA%A1ch_%C4%90%E1%BA%B1ng_(1288)">Battle
of Bach Dang</a>. Three episodes (including both video podcasts) discuss
the tools and evolution of early humans, especially the position in the
evolutionary tree of some complete skeletons recently found in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sediba">Sediba</a>. There is also an
interview about bronze age burials in Cyprus and other podcasts focus on
the archaeological difficulties and discoveries underwater or in cities.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I often find myself writing time-based caches. Something like storing
the last X hours of ticks from a data feed. Most teams I join usually
have a utility class to help with such tasks. In a recent move I joined
a team that didn’t have such a utility, but did have a need for such a
cache. Before coding, I thought I do a quick check to see if anything
new had come along to help. At this point I discovered the Java 6
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/NavigableMap.html">NavigableMap</a>
interface.</p>

<p>NavigableMap defines a type of sorted map with handy methods for
obtaining submaps. So to get a map of the entries greater than a
particular value use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">tailMap</code> method. The corresponding method for
the submap less than a value is <code class="highlighter-rouge">headMap</code>. These methods return a view
on the original map. So changes to the submap are reflected in the
original map. The JDK provides
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentSkipListMap.html">concurrent</a>
and
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/TreeMap.html">non-concurrent</a>
implementations of the interface.</p>

<p>This is very useful for a time-based cache. Create a NavigableMap sorted
on the time (I used the epoch milliseconds returned by
<code class="highlighter-rouge">System.currentTimeMillis()</code>) then <code class="highlighter-rouge">tailMap</code> returns the entries younger
than a given time, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">headMap</code> those older. So to trim the cache of
entries older than a certain time use
<code class="highlighter-rouge">headMap(System.currentTimeMillis() - maxAge).clear()</code>. So easy!</p>

<p>Here is a complete time-based cache class for use as an example.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Almost exactly six months ago I wrote a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/08/modern-gaming.html">review of some modern computer
games</a>. All were
well known, and I said they were all excellent. I even suggested that
computer games were in a golden age - better than ever before. Now I
have completed 3 more well known, highly regarded, recent games. How did
they do in comparison? Not as well unfortunately.</p>

<p>First up I played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare">Call
Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, the original 2007 Modern Warfare game
which spawned the incredibly popular series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person
shooters</a> of the same
name. At first I was impressed with the intensity of this game. However,
the fast pace quickly slows with realisation there is essentially no
penalty to getting shot. Death is a mere slight pause. I felt like I was
on rails, being led through the action. The game was just a reaction
speed test. Multiplayer is probably better, but I didn’t play that - I
doubt my reactions are fast enough. The story is ok, nothing special.
Although I did detect a possible subtle satire on war - but that could
just be me. The story is most notable for a couple of impressive famous
scenes (the nuke level and the gunship level) that do work very well.
This game is probably too linear and twitchy for me.</p>

<p>Next up I played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed:_Brotherhood">Assasins
Creed: Brotherhood</a>. I was particularly looking forward to this game
because of its open world setting in medieval Rome. Certainly the
graphics are beautiful and I enjoyed wandering around the ruins of Rome.
But the controls! This game was incredibly frustrating - it was hard to
get my avatar to perform as intended. I tried for many hours (28 total),
but still found myself often shouting at the computer and cursing the
clumsy controls. Eventually I just raced to finish the main story.
Incidently, the story is very silly and not worth discussing. This game
could have been so much better, but is just annoying.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago I completed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock">Bioshock</a>. This is an excellent
game, restoring my belief in modern gaming after the previous two
disappointments. The Ayn Rand-gone-wild underwater setting is
incredible. The art-deco and slightly cartoony (but I think that was the
point) graphics are decent. I often found myself just walking around
looking at the banners and architecture. Most importantly the controls
were super smooth. The game was also quite intense, particularly at the
start and end. Sometimes I jumped at a surprising action or went looking
for someone I could hear nearby. It is interesting that both this game
and Mass Effect 2, give the player some small choices that make minor
differences to gameplay, as opposed to the lack of agency in Modern
Warfare. A little choice (even if it is fairly inconsequential in plot
terms) goes a long way in making the player feel involved.</p>

    <p>After joining Knowledge-based Systems at Rio Tinto R&amp;TD, my first task
was working on the MineSim project. This was a very successful
application to simulate minesites. To do this a user would define the
topology/geology of a mine, the equipment/personnel available and the
goals to pursue. The program would then simulate the mine minute by
minute. New blocks would be blown when ready, little loaders would muck
out the ore from the block and large trucks moved round the mine,
picking up ore and driving back to the dumps.</p>
