    <p>A couple of weeks ago I bought a new laptop from Apple. Below is the
shipping report on how it got to me from its final manufacturer in
China. An impressive jaunt - even if it did have to spend the weekend in
Koeln.</p>

    <p>On Thursday was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women">Olympic Women’s Football
Final</a>,
which I attended.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/7753266456/in/photostream/lightbox/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8288/7753266456_4d3129b8df.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I’m not a huge Football fan, but Ann wanted to see at least one Olympic
event and this was the only one for which we could get tickets (the
Olympic online ticketing system is a mess). And not bad tickets they
were, just off to the side 21 rows back from one of the goals. We had a
clear view of everything that happened at our end. Although despite the
pitch being smaller than I had expected (maybe I’m just used to the
larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football_playing_field">AFL
pitches</a>),
my depth perception wasn’t too good when play was at the other end.</p>

<p>The game was good with lots of action. The US beat Japan 2-1. Japan
appeared by far the more aggressive team, or maybe they were more
desperate, as the US went a goal up early in the match. Certainly the US
players owe their goalie a few drinks after a series of great saves.</p>

<p>It was a good natured game and crowd (although more fouls occurred
towards the end of the match). There seemed to be more US supporters and
more US flags, but there was still a good number of Japanese supporters
and no segregation. Both “USA, USA, USA” and “Nippon, Nippon, Nippon”
chants regularly reverberated around the stadium. The crowd was huge, I
have never seem so many people in one place - 80,207 according the the
announcer. There was just a continuous flood of people heading in and
out of the stadium.</p>

<p>A surprisingly good night.</p>

    <p>Time for reviews of 3 more computer games I have recently completed. As
perhaps gathered from other posts, playing games is now work for me! Or,
at least I should try to analyse what makes games fun (or not). So far I
have learnt that a small amount of choice can go a long way in making
the player feel part of the world, and that smooth easy to use controls
are a must.</p>

<p>I got <a href="http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki">The Witcher</a> cheaply
when I picked up its lauded sequel. I decided the try the original
first. It plays like a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">MMO</a>.
It reminded me of <a href="http://www.lotro.com">Lord of the Rings Online</a> in
terms of graphics and addictive gameplay. The game is based on the a
series of Polish fantasy books and there is a great deal of back story
to it. There is also a decent plot, which doesn’t develop in the obvious
way. The downside is the number of cutscenes, they are everywhere and
they are long. It seemed like every time you wanted to do anything there
was a couple of cutscenes to get through. This and the large body of
lore was overwhelming. It is a good game and I played it to the end
(about 60 hours, including side missions), but I did feel it was a bit
too big and slow.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Cause_2">Just Cause 2</a> is almost the
complete opposite - it is fast paced and stupidly good fun. The basic
idea is that you run around destroying stuff and generally causing chaos - which is how the game is scored (in chaos points). The tropical island
game world is open and beautifully rendered. I can understand why <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/11/my-holiday-in-beautiful-panau.html">one
blogger joked they holidayed on
Panau</a>.
It must have been a huge amount of work to create all the game art.
Missions are short and little distracts from the mayhem. Also the player
is hugely overpowered, short of calling in air support or other heavy
weaponry, the locals have little chance. This game takes a few simple
idea and takes them completely over the top.</p>

<p>I also made a short trip back to Liberty City for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV">GTA
IV</a> games <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Lost_and_Damned">The Lost
and the
Damned</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Ballad_of_Gay_Tony">The Ballad of Gay
Tony</a>.
It was good to be back, even the starting music theme was evocative of
good times. These two extra games play just like the original (<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/08/modern-gaming.html">review
here</a>). Again
the open world is terrific, the controls are a little clunky. The story
of the TLaTD is particularly good, but I found TBoGT to have too many
cutscenes and airborne missions (where the controls are particularly
annoying). Still, very enjoyable.</p>

<p>So what have I learnt from these games for my own work? Best to have a
low death penalty or easy restart. Keep cutscenes to a minimum and
ensure they are short. It is better to try telling the story as part of
interactive gameplay.</p>

    <p>I have decided to call the game I’m developing <strong>Concealed Intent</strong>. It
is a game of turn-based tactical stealth space combat. I’m hoping that I
will be in a position to release it next year (possibly late next year).
Further details will be published at <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/games/#ConcealedIntent">Jarrah Technology
website</a>,
including blog posts on the technology and development of the game.</p>

    <p>Gold and diamonds greatly annoy me. I was once employed by a large
mining company working on projects for a small gold mine and a large
diamond mine. It seems to me that both these materials have a market
price far beyond their intrinsic value, instead they are supported
largely by marketing.</p>

<p>Gold is seen as a store of value because of its history - it is just
accepted this is the case. However gold has few industrial uses. A small
amount is used for jewellery (surprisingly not that much - a little gold
goes a long way). Most is used for speculation for little return. Don’t
just take it from me, <a href="http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/02/09/warren-buffett-berkshire-shareholder-letter/">Warren Buffet has a similar
view</a></p>

<p>Diamonds are a little different - they are used heavily in industry for
drills and other tools requiring a very hard surface. Nearly any diamond
can do this job, not just the expensive gem quality diamonds. Although
the supply of diamonds is huge compared to this use! There are
warehouses full of diamonds. The market price is entirely manufactured
over the last century and not based on any lack of supply or natural
demand. 150 years ago diamonds were not popular gems. It was canny
marketing and monopolistic pricing from
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers">DeBeers</a> that made them de
rigeur for engagement rings and the like. It’s not even a good store of
value; it is just status-seeking.</p>

<p>When I worked for a diamond mine they were troubled by the large number
of brown diamonds they were producing. These were much harder to sell
and not considered good enough for jewellery. So what did they do? They
called them “champagne”, “burgundy” or similar names and created a
market for them. Now they can sell as gems what was considered waste 30
years ago.</p>

<p>Just say no.</p>
