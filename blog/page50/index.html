Towards the end of the year (the exact date is still uncertain), I’m
physically moving to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur">Kuala

(email, website, etc) will remained unchanged. It is not yet known what
I’ll be doing there - there are some work visa issues to be sorted out.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Almost exactly six months ago I wrote a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/08/modern-gaming.html">review of some modern computer
games</a>. All were
well known, and I said they were all excellent. I even suggested that
computer games were in a golden age - better than ever before. Now I
have completed 3 more well known, highly regarded, recent games. How did
they do in comparison? Not as well unfortunately.</p>

<p>First up I played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_of_Duty_4:_Modern_Warfare">Call
Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a>, the original 2007 Modern Warfare game
which spawned the incredibly popular series of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter">first-person
shooters</a> of the same
name. At first I was impressed with the intensity of this game. However,
the fast pace quickly slows with realisation there is essentially no
penalty to getting shot. Death is a mere slight pause. I felt like I was
on rails, being led through the action. The game was just a reaction
speed test. Multiplayer is probably better, but I didn’t play that - I
doubt my reactions are fast enough. The story is ok, nothing special.
Although I did detect a possible subtle satire on war - but that could
just be me. The story is most notable for a couple of impressive famous
scenes (the nuke level and the gunship level) that do work very well.
This game is probably too linear and twitchy for me.</p>

<p>Next up I played
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin's_Creed:_Brotherhood">Assasins
Creed: Brotherhood</a>. I was particularly looking forward to this game
because of its open world setting in medieval Rome. Certainly the
graphics are beautiful and I enjoyed wandering around the ruins of Rome.
But the controls! This game was incredibly frustrating - it was hard to
get my avatar to perform as intended. I tried for many hours (28 total),
but still found myself often shouting at the computer and cursing the
clumsy controls. Eventually I just raced to finish the main story.
Incidently, the story is very silly and not worth discussing. This game
could have been so much better, but is just annoying.</p>

<p>Just a few days ago I completed
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioShock">Bioshock</a>. This is an excellent
game, restoring my belief in modern gaming after the previous two
disappointments. The Ayn Rand-gone-wild underwater setting is
incredible. The art-deco and slightly cartoony (but I think that was the
point) graphics are decent. I often found myself just walking around
looking at the banners and architecture. Most importantly the controls
were super smooth. The game was also quite intense, particularly at the
start and end. Sometimes I jumped at a surprising action or went looking
for someone I could hear nearby. It is interesting that both this game
and Mass Effect 2, give the player some small choices that make minor
differences to gameplay, as opposed to the lack of agency in Modern
Warfare. A little choice (even if it is fairly inconsequential in plot
terms) goes a long way in making the player feel involved.</p>

    <p>After joining Knowledge-based Systems at Rio Tinto R&amp;TD, my first task
was working on the MineSim project. This was a very successful
application to simulate minesites. To do this a user would define the
topology/geology of a mine, the equipment/personnel available and the
goals to pursue. The program would then simulate the mine minute by
minute. New blocks would be blown when ready, little loaders would muck
out the ore from the block and large trucks moved round the mine,
picking up ore and driving back to the dumps.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/03/electrolley.html">Electrolley</a> I
worked at <a href="http://www.riotinto.com/">Rio Tinto</a> in their Research and
Technical Development division. I had wanted a job there for sometime.
Many of my honours classmates and one of my ex-lecturers (the one I
originally wanted as my honours supervisor) worked there. I had
interviewed with them during my PhD, but was rejected as the position
was for a more practical programmer and they saw me as too theoretical.
After a few months at Electolley I was contacted saying a position more
suited for my skills had arisen and asking if was I still interested.
Soon I was being interviewed again.</p>

<p>The interview process was the most arduous I’ve ever encountered. First
there was an interview by a couple of managers. Then another interview
by the entire team I would be joining. A panel of nine people arrayed in
front on me. During this part they asked me to give an impromptu 15
minute presentation of my ex-PhD topic. A quizzing on its practical
applicability followed. By this stage I have been onsite two hours and
they said it was time for the next stage. I was taxied into the city and
given a battery of psychometric tests. There was a logical reasoning
test (well-above average), vocabulary test (average), Myers-Briggs test
(INTP, as always) and another test I’d never heard of before to check my
work aptitude. Nearly 5 hours in total and I was completely drained.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/Rio-Tinto-logo-main.jpg" alt="Rio Logo" title="Rio Logo" /></p>

<p>I got the job and after a few months I heard that it didn’t really
matter what the tests said. Half the team (including the manager) knew
me from uni or honours, so unless I had a breakdown the job was always
mine. To prove the point I was told the results of the psychometric
tests. Apparently the unknown test had indicated I was completely
unemployable and unable to work in a team. They ignored it and hired me
anyway.</p>

<p>The Rio Tinto R&amp;TD team in Perth was in beautiful purpose built building
near Curtin University. It was designed to be like a village - a central
street walkway acting as a street with trees and benches (all inside).
Off the walkway came the open plan office space. There was also a large
reception, board room, library, large eating area and kitchen. No
canteen, but I never heard of anyone in Perth having a canteen. It was
set on landscaped grounds with more than enough parking and there was
tons of natural light. A very pleasant workspace. The only problem was
the abandoned building and the emptiness.</p>

<p>The complex was built to house over 300 staff, but never housed more
than 55 people while I was there. There was another entire building with
workshops unused and locked up. Most of my colleagues spread themselves
out over 2 desks. A couple of months before I started there was over 200
people on site. Most desks were taken and the workshops full of
engineers. However, many were made redundant or transferred around the
time of my interview. Four small teams were left (plus admin staff).</p>

<p>I was in Knowledge-Based Systems. We were supposed to focus on applying
machine learning techniques (like expert systems) to mining problems.
Although most of our time was spent writing mine simulations, linear
optimisation systems (basically the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm">simplex
method</a> with a large
number of variables and a nice GUI) or training tools. There was another
team of more “practical” software developers working with early web
technologies. On the non-computer side was a team of mathematicians and
engineers doing various consulting tasks and a small team focused on
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_fluid_dynamics">Computational Fluid Dynamics
(CFD)</a> in
smelters.</p>

<p>With just 1st class Honours I was clearly one of the least educated
people in the building. Their was a distinct academic bias. Most of the
senior managers had PhDs, as did probably a third of the staff. People
generally had time to think - although that may not have been a good
indicator for future prospects. There were often discussions of very
scientific topics and opinions were always well informed. Here I learnt
the more theoretical side of software engineering with regular arguments
on what process or pattern was best in a certain situation. Later I
learnt the more practical side.</p>

<p>While I was there the place had an eerie atmosphere. All non-managers
openly believed that we would all be made redundant sooner rather than
later. Everyone knew the intimate details of the redundancy policy. It
was very generous so staff turnover was low as people waited for their
inevitable payout. I remember hearing a couple of anonymous shouts of
“make me redundant now!”. There was a bit of black humour around the
situation. When the head of the global technology division changed we
joked about him being an evil leprechaun (he had an unfortunate staff
photo) who would sack us all. We were right!</p>

<p>The site was also extremely safe. All sites in Rio Tinto apparently
followed the same safety precautions. Thus our research office building
took safety as seriously as a mine site. There was a sign at the
entrance proudly displaying there there had been no lost time due to
injury for over 600 days (not sure the actual number, but it was years).
Towards the end of my time there the counter reset after a morning was
lost when a minor traffic accident resulted in a checkup at the doctors
(they were fine). We had a safety manager who trained us all on the
safety precautions. Every month he would tour the site for safety
violations and hand out cautions - normally for overly large stacks of
paper or dirty mugs. I felt a little sorry for the guy, there wasn’t
much for him to do. He previously had a similar job at a mine, which
must have been much more interesting. Although it was impressive how
after I casually mentioned my fingers ached a little one day to see how
serious it was taken. I was visited by an outside ergonomics expert who
recommended my desk be lowered a few centimeters. That afternoon it was
dismantled and rebuilt! The expert was right, the new desk was much
better.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/work/rio_mug.png" alt="My Rio Mug" title="My Rio Mug" /></p>

<p>I sat with two colleagues is a small area of desks partitioned off
between a reception desk and the General Manager’s office. The area was
partitioned into thirds, each section with 2 desks, 2 PCs, etc. We took
one section each. It was a good little spot. The partitions went up to
eye level, and there was only one place to enter the area. The
partitions were also setup such that to reach the back thirds a visitor
would need to make a couple of 90 degree turns. Furthermore large pot
plants had been placed at strategic points to block sightlines into the
area. The basic affect was that we could tell when someone was coming
towards us, but they couldn’t see what we were doing. Knowing the person
who sat furthest from the entrance (an aspiring DJ), I don’t think this
setup was unintentional. For the same reason none of the three of us
could see eachothers’ screens. I had two PCs, but only ever used one, a
decent second hand computer (from someone recently made redundant -
Pentium2 with a 17” CRT, good for the late 90’s). One of the other guys
had 2 PCs and bright blue <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SGI_Indigo">Silicon Graphics
Indigo</a> machine for a 3D
modelling project he did - very cool.</p>

<p>As a small office in a global company we traveled often to various
mining sites around the world. I only went once, to an Australian gold
mine, which I will write about later. Others went around the world. The
one place I would have like to have visited was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grasberg_mine">Grasberg mine in
Indonesia</a> - a very large
gold and copper mine up a tropical mountain. There was some talk of
sending me there to run a training course, but I didn’t act keen and the
timing wasn’t good with my other projects. In retrospect I should have
volunteered.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua_(province)">Irian
Jaya</a> is a place that most foreigners (or even Indonesians) do not
get a chance to visit. There were always good stories about visits.
During the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997_Asian_financial_crisis">Asian financial crisis in
1997</a> one
colleague visiting there managed to run up an enormous 5 digit expenses
bill - he occasionally told snippets of the story of his few days living
the high life. Management were aghast, but I had the sense they were
slightly impressed with the ability to spend so much when the local
currency was so cheap.</p>

<p>Soon after I declined the trip to Grasberg one of our staff visiting the
mine was threatened with a spear when some locals bust into the onsite
offices. I think it turned out to be a dispute over a pig, but
management was greatly concerned as there is a low-level insurgency in
the area (over independence from Indonesia). No one from our office ever
went there again.</p>

<p>Working at R&amp;TD was fairly pleasant on a day-to-day basis. It was small
enough for us all know eachother, and there was a slight siege mentality - us versus the off-site management wanting to shut us down. Everyone
got a mug with their name (or nickname) printed on it when they started
work. This stopped the problem everywhere else about disappearing
mugs/cups. I still have mine 12 years later. When an eclipse occurred we
all headed outside for the afternoon to see it. There was a social
committee which arranged various regular small events. I was actually a
member or the committee for a while. I arranged the Christmas Party
river cruise right before I left. In fact I didn’t go to the party I
organised, it didn’t seem right as I quit and left a few weeks before
the event.</p>

<p>I also tried to get involved in the company superannuation/pension plan.
They had elections for staff representatives on the plan’s board. I
thought it would look good on my resume. Most of the people I worked
with acted bemused when told I was running. My campaign was fairly weak,
consisting mainly of writing a blurb for the company magazine (As did
all the other candidates). In the end I think I got about 20 votes, not
even half the people I worked with. The winners got thousands of votes.</p>

<p>After I had been at Rio just over a year, the work starting slowing,
senior management swapped jobs and a review was announced. It seemed
like the end was nigh. I knew the redundancy policy very well (as did
everyone) and until I had been there over two years I would receive very
little. It seemed unlikely I would make it that far or be promoted. It
is best to jump than be pushed so I looked around. Finding a job in the
dotcom boom was not too hard, and I left after 18 months at Rio. A few
months later all but a handful of my ex-colleagues were sacked and the
facility shuttered. My timing was just right.</p>

<p>My last memories of working at Rio were having competitions with the
aspiring DJ next to me over who could leave earliest. He won by leaving
at 3pm, walking past the General Managers office and saying goodbye
before walking out. I didn’t have the balls to top that even though I
had quit. On my last day we all went to the pub for lunch. I left about
4pm, my manager and most of his team were still there (and stayed late
into the night). He teased me for leaving “early”.</p>
