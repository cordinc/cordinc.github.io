    <p>On Friday I went to the evening <a href="http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/wheelchair-basketball/">Wheelchair
Basketball</a>
session at the Paralympics:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/7923853742/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/7923853742_2dc8b9b861.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>First we had the chance to wander around the Olympic Park. It was
surprising how little park there was, since I was expecting lots of
greenery. However, there was enough space for a quiet picnic besides a
canal. As expected their were crowds of people, but not so many as to
block paths. Everyone seemed good-natured and happy to be there.</p>

<p>We watched two matches: a men’s game between Australia and Turkey; and a
China versus France women’s game. The sport is quite fast and furious.
People were regularly knocked out of their wheelchairs and stayed on
ground until helped up (by their teammates or coach). Most of the rules
seem the same as the able-bodied version of Basketball, although the
tactics a little different as fighting for position appeared far more
important. Presumably this is due to the wheelchairs occupying more
space and the competitors inability to jump. So being in the prime
shooting or rebound position meant the next nearest person was a
wheelchair width away with no chance of jumping over the top of you.
Also, it was very common to see defensive players position themselves so
a opponent couldn’t move (as their wheels were jammed). In this manner
the Chinese team used a full court press to prevent the French even
crossing the halfway line before the shot clock expired.</p>

<p>The men’s match was very exciting. Australia won in the end, but Turkey
lead by 1 with 5 minutes to go. The winning margin of 7 was the largest
gap between the teams since the first quarter. The women’s match was a
walkover - the Chinese completely dominated, managing twice the score of
their French opponents.</p>

    <p>The third day of Unite12 started quietly after the awards party the
night before. To their credit the winners of the big prize got up in
time to deliver one of the first sessions of the day (which I didn’t
attend). The crowd seemed typical to other IT related conferences or
courses - 90-95% male and averaging around 30. There also wasn’t much
swapping of business cards in general - swapping contact details
electronically seems to be far more popular now.</p>

    <p>On the second day of Unite12 I slept in and missed the first talk in
order to prepare for a long afternoon. It was a presentation by Brian
Fargo on the successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>
campaign for <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/">Wasteland</a>. A
great deal has been said about using Kickstarter for games recently, and
ConcealedIntent is unlikely to use the service soon (or at all). So I
thought this could be safely missed.</p>

    <p>Wednesday 22 August was the first day of the
<a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a> Unity conference in Amsterdam,
which I was lucky enough to attend. My first thought was Unity is larger
than I thought - the conference was packed. A couple of sessions saw
people sitting on the floor. The official attendance was 1200, over
double my expectation (although 200 of that number are Unity employees).
Also surprising, a nice lunch and breakfast was provided.</p>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago I bought a new laptop from Apple. Below is the
shipping report on how it got to me from its final manufacturer in
China. An impressive jaunt - even if it did have to spend the weekend in
Koeln.</p>
