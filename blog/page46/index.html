  <div class="content">
    <p>Thanks to various Indie Bundles I now have scores of “small indie
games”. That is not meant to be disparaging (I aspire to create such
little games), just an assesment of their scope. Small teams have
necessarily smaller ambitions - at least they do if they want to finish!
Without further ado, here are my thoughts on 10 of them.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Binding_of_Isaac_(video_game)">The
Binding of Isaac</a> is a great game and quite addictive. It is a sort
of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike">Roguelike</a>. Each game lasts
around 30 minutes (although I’m yet to reach the last level) with the
player advancing room-by-room through a dungeon. The gameplay is
randomised with a reasonable number of monster types, but a huge array
of objects/upgrades. It is very easy to get started but very hard to
complete and luck plays a large role. Graphics and sound are good, plus
it has religious metaphors and poo jokes - definitely a winner. This is
staying on my desktop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.steel-storm.com/">Steel Storm</a> is a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoot_'em_up">top-down arcade
shooter</a> that is not too hectic. It is not on rails so the player has
some choice and can play the game at their own pace. The gameplay is
quite good and I completed the single player campaign in 10 hours. The
only downside is that it gets a bit repetitive in the later levels and
the homing missiles seem to solve all problems (for all enemies just
back up behind cover and fire homing missiles). Still definitely fun and
worth the few dollars it costs.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.crayonphysics.com/">Crayon Physics Deluxe</a> a puzzler where
the player draws in crayon on the screen to create physics objects. For
instance, a swinging mallet can be drawn to hit a ball and propel it
across the screen. Nice idea, well implemented, but not for me.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cogsgame.com/">Cogs</a> is another puzzle game where the player
moves around tiles to form particular patterns. I like this and got
about a quarter of the way through in an hour, but it got much more
difficult towards the end. It is staying on my desktop as I can see
myself playing this occasionally.</p>

<p>I would consider <a href="http://www.hemispheregames.com/osmos/">Osmos</a> a
puzzler, but an unusual one. You play as a floating blob looking to
absorb other smaller blobs while avoiding larger blobs that can absorb
you. At first it seems hypnotic and relaxing, but soon becomes
frustrating in a good way. Staying on my desktop.</p>

<p><a href="http://universesandbox.com/">Universe Sandbox</a> is a gravity simulator.
You can model the solar system or stars falling into a black hole or
anything. It’s quite pretty and has a range of interesting preset
scenarios. However at larger timescales the simulation breaks down and
when setting up bespoke scenarios it’s hard put objects in the exact
right spot (if for instance putting planets at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point">Lagrange
points</a>). The developer
was at
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/09/unite12---day-3.html">Unite12</a> and
mentioned they are working on version 2 which will address these points.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.koshutin.com/">Hammerfight</a> is a 2D side-view fight game
where the players fly barrel-like contraptions and hit eachother with
hammers (hence the name). It held my interest for about 30 minutes
before the clunky controls and a screen so cluttered I couldn’t see the
action ruined it for me. The basic idea seemed to be just furiously
moving the mouse to swing the hammer. A nice idea, but perhaps a little
too slight.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.finalformgames.com/jamestown/">Jamestown</a> is a classic
top-down shooter with 8 bit graphics. It is fast and furious like I
remember the old arcade games
(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1942_(video_game)">1942</a> comes
to mind). This is not my sort of game, I prefer something slower.</p>

<p>My review of the last 3 games is the same.
<a href="http://thelettervsixtim.es/">VVVVVV</a>, <a href="http://www.andyetitmoves.net/">And Yet It
Moves</a> and <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Super Meat
Boy</a> are all platformers. In these games the
source of difficulty is often not working out what needs to be done, but
actually performing the required actions with split-second accuracy.
Again, not my sort of game. Still, I can appreciate them: AYIM has an
interesting ripped paper art style; and, VVVVVV is a glorious 8 bit
throwback. However, they have all been removed from my desktop after
less than an hour each of play.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>On Friday I went to the evening <a href="http://www.london2012.com/paralympics/wheelchair-basketball/">Wheelchair
Basketball</a>
session at the Paralympics:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/7923853742/in/photostream/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8039/7923853742_2dc8b9b861.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>First we had the chance to wander around the Olympic Park. It was
surprising how little park there was, since I was expecting lots of
greenery. However, there was enough space for a quiet picnic besides a
canal. As expected their were crowds of people, but not so many as to
block paths. Everyone seemed good-natured and happy to be there.</p>

<p>We watched two matches: a men’s game between Australia and Turkey; and a
China versus France women’s game. The sport is quite fast and furious.
People were regularly knocked out of their wheelchairs and stayed on
ground until helped up (by their teammates or coach). Most of the rules
seem the same as the able-bodied version of Basketball, although the
tactics a little different as fighting for position appeared far more
important. Presumably this is due to the wheelchairs occupying more
space and the competitors inability to jump. So being in the prime
shooting or rebound position meant the next nearest person was a
wheelchair width away with no chance of jumping over the top of you.
Also, it was very common to see defensive players position themselves so
a opponent couldn’t move (as their wheels were jammed). In this manner
the Chinese team used a full court press to prevent the French even
crossing the halfway line before the shot clock expired.</p>

<p>The men’s match was very exciting. Australia won in the end, but Turkey
lead by 1 with 5 minutes to go. The winning margin of 7 was the largest
gap between the teams since the first quarter. The women’s match was a
walkover - the Chinese completely dominated, managing twice the score of
their French opponents.</p>

    <p>The third day of Unite12 started quietly after the awards party the
night before. To their credit the winners of the big prize got up in
time to deliver one of the first sessions of the day (which I didn’t
attend). The crowd seemed typical to other IT related conferences or
courses - 90-95% male and averaging around 30. There also wasn’t much
swapping of business cards in general - swapping contact details
electronically seems to be far more popular now.</p>

    <p>On the second day of Unite12 I slept in and missed the first talk in
order to prepare for a long afternoon. It was a presentation by Brian
Fargo on the successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>
campaign for <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/">Wasteland</a>. A
great deal has been said about using Kickstarter for games recently, and
ConcealedIntent is unlikely to use the service soon (or at all). So I
thought this could be safely missed.</p>

    <p>Wednesday 22 August was the first day of the
<a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a> Unity conference in Amsterdam,
which I was lucky enough to attend. My first thought was Unity is larger
than I thought - the conference was packed. A couple of sessions saw
people sitting on the floor. The official attendance was 1200, over
double my expectation (although 200 of that number are Unity employees).
Also surprising, a nice lunch and breakfast was provided.</p>
