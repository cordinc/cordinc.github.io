    <p>On the second day of Unite12 I slept in and missed the first talk in
order to prepare for a long afternoon. It was a presentation by Brian
Fargo on the successful <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a>
campaign for <a href="http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/">Wasteland</a>. A
great deal has been said about using Kickstarter for games recently, and
ConcealedIntent is unlikely to use the service soon (or at all). So I
thought this could be safely missed.</p>

    <p>Wednesday 22 August was the first day of the
<a href="http://unity3d.com/unite/">Unite12</a> Unity conference in Amsterdam,
which I was lucky enough to attend. My first thought was Unity is larger
than I thought - the conference was packed. A couple of sessions saw
people sitting on the floor. The official attendance was 1200, over
double my expectation (although 200 of that number are Unity employees).
Also surprising, a nice lunch and breakfast was provided.</p>

    <p>A couple of weeks ago I bought a new laptop from Apple. Below is the
shipping report on how it got to me from its final manufacturer in
China. An impressive jaunt - even if it did have to spend the weekend in
Koeln.</p>

    <p>On Thursday was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Women">Olympic Women’s Football
Final</a>,
which I attended.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/33547649@N07/7753266456/in/photostream/lightbox/"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8288/7753266456_4d3129b8df.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>I’m not a huge Football fan, but Ann wanted to see at least one Olympic
event and this was the only one for which we could get tickets (the
Olympic online ticketing system is a mess). And not bad tickets they
were, just off to the side 21 rows back from one of the goals. We had a
clear view of everything that happened at our end. Although despite the
pitch being smaller than I had expected (maybe I’m just used to the
larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football_playing_field">AFL
pitches</a>),
my depth perception wasn’t too good when play was at the other end.</p>

<p>The game was good with lots of action. The US beat Japan 2-1. Japan
appeared by far the more aggressive team, or maybe they were more
desperate, as the US went a goal up early in the match. Certainly the US
players owe their goalie a few drinks after a series of great saves.</p>

<p>It was a good natured game and crowd (although more fouls occurred
towards the end of the match). There seemed to be more US supporters and
more US flags, but there was still a good number of Japanese supporters
and no segregation. Both “USA, USA, USA” and “Nippon, Nippon, Nippon”
chants regularly reverberated around the stadium. The crowd was huge, I
have never seem so many people in one place - 80,207 according the the
announcer. There was just a continuous flood of people heading in and
out of the stadium.</p>

<p>A surprisingly good night.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Time for reviews of 3 more computer games I have recently completed. As
perhaps gathered from other posts, playing games is now work for me! Or,
at least I should try to analyse what makes games fun (or not). So far I
have learnt that a small amount of choice can go a long way in making
the player feel part of the world, and that smooth easy to use controls
are a must.</p>

<p>I got <a href="http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/Witcher_Wiki">The Witcher</a> cheaply
when I picked up its lauded sequel. I decided the try the original
first. It plays like a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_game">MMO</a>.
It reminded me of <a href="http://www.lotro.com">Lord of the Rings Online</a> in
terms of graphics and addictive gameplay. The game is based on the a
series of Polish fantasy books and there is a great deal of back story
to it. There is also a decent plot, which doesn’t develop in the obvious
way. The downside is the number of cutscenes, they are everywhere and
they are long. It seemed like every time you wanted to do anything there
was a couple of cutscenes to get through. This and the large body of
lore was overwhelming. It is a good game and I played it to the end
(about 60 hours, including side missions), but I did feel it was a bit
too big and slow.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Cause_2">Just Cause 2</a> is almost the
complete opposite - it is fast paced and stupidly good fun. The basic
idea is that you run around destroying stuff and generally causing chaos - which is how the game is scored (in chaos points). The tropical island
game world is open and beautifully rendered. I can understand why <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2010/11/my-holiday-in-beautiful-panau.html">one
blogger joked they holidayed on
Panau</a>.
It must have been a huge amount of work to create all the game art.
Missions are short and little distracts from the mayhem. Also the player
is hugely overpowered, short of calling in air support or other heavy
weaponry, the locals have little chance. This game takes a few simple
idea and takes them completely over the top.</p>

<p>I also made a short trip back to Liberty City for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_IV">GTA
IV</a> games <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Lost_and_Damned">The Lost
and the
Damned</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto:_The_Ballad_of_Gay_Tony">The Ballad of Gay
Tony</a>.
It was good to be back, even the starting music theme was evocative of
good times. These two extra games play just like the original (<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2011/08/modern-gaming.html">review
here</a>). Again
the open world is terrific, the controls are a little clunky. The story
of the TLaTD is particularly good, but I found TBoGT to have too many
cutscenes and airborne missions (where the controls are particularly
annoying). Still, very enjoyable.</p>

<p>So what have I learnt from these games for my own work? Best to have a
low death penalty or easy restart. Keep cutscenes to a minimum and
ensure they are short. It is better to try telling the story as part of
interactive gameplay.</p>
