    <p>Recently we spent a long weekend on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_Lanta_District">Koh
Lanta</a> in southern
Thailand. From KL it is a short (and cheap on <a href="http://www.airasia.com/my/en/home.page">Air
Asia</a>) flight to Krabi and then
a transfer to the island itself. Koh Lanta bills itself as a less
party-oriented than other nearby resort areas (like <a href="http://wikitravel.org/en/Ko_Phi_Phi">Koh Phi
Phi</a>). This is definitely a
relative measure, as a drive along the island’s main beaches showed
packed tourist shops, bars and hotels. Although, the further south down
the island we went the less touristy it became.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/Koh_Lanta_north.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>Our hotel, <a href="http://www.lalaanta.com/">LaLanta Hideaway</a>, is the most
southerly on the island and backs onto a national park. Thus it is quiet
and remote from the tourist strip - which is exactly what we wanted. The
weekend was spent lazing around the hotel and the beach it backed onto.
We walked, swam, kayaked, had a massage, and ate. A very relaxing trip.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/Koh_Lanta_south.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>The only downside is the transfer from Krabi airport to the hotel. It
took 2 hours 20 minutes on the way out and 3 and a half hours on the way
back (when we got caught in traffic). Compare this to the flight time of
1 hour 30 minutes.</p>

    <p>I have a problem with ideas. Not that I don’t have any, but that I have
too many. Admittedly most of the ideas aren’t very good or are totally
impractical, but they still take time to evaluate. Furthermore, a new
idea is exciting. When I first think of something new it can consume my
thoughts for days - both with evaluation and fantasy. As a result other
tasks suffer - <a href="http://sivers.org/multiply">ideas are worthless, execution is
everything</a>.</p>

<p>When I wanted to write a computer game, three months worth of ideas and
notes went into a document. By the end of that time there were 9
different ideas in there. The best (and most importantly, simplest) idea
became <a href="http://www.concealedintent.com">Concealed Intent</a>. The other 8
are not practical or not interesting enough to see to completion.
Although all are still sitting in that archived document - a couple are
games I would play, but they are just too ambitious for a small team.
Concealed Intent was the best idea by a good distance.</p>

<p>A couple of other idea have come along during development. After a few
days thought, they went into the archive with the others. Now I have had
another idea. A great idea. A better idea than Concealed Intent. It
requires simpler coding (no 3D). It is easier to play and more
accessible. The story is emergent based on play. It could even be a
casual free-to-play web game for maximum reach. I have several hours
developing the day. Time that would otherwise be spent on Concealed
Intent and thus development on the latter has slowed.</p>

<p>What to do? I think I need to <a href="http://makegames.tumblr.com/post/44181247500/making-it-in-indie-games-starter-guide">finish what I
started</a>.
Many ideas will come along, but the main focus has to be completing
Concealed Intent. Otherwise I will be forever starting something and
then dropping it for the latest great idea. Still, a few hours now and
then on the new idea can’t hurt too much, right?</p>

    <p>This is the story of the 5-year
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">D&amp;D</a> campaign I
played in while at high-school. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/dd-campaign-history-part-1.html">Part 1 of the
story</a>
follows the ever-changing party through a series of unconnected dungeon
crawls. Now after about a year of play, the group has settled down into
a bunch or regulars around level 5 under the old first edition D&amp;D
rules. Having gained significant powers, money and notoriety they are
becoming noticed by local rulers.</p>

<p>The party consisted of 5 characters:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Greymarel - an alcoholic wizard</li>
  <li>Bandance - a pyromaniac evil wizard, often getting in arguments with
the rest of the party</li>
  <li>Kur-Tas Kai - a war priest of Kiri-Jolith, and the organiser of the
party (if not de facto leader)</li>
  <li>Talin - a brave, but occasionally foolhardy, ranger</li>
  <li>Ugarit - a fighter</li>
</ul>

<p>The party sailed into Karameikos on their return leg from the primitive
southern isles they recently explored (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Isle_of_Dread">Isle Of
Dread</a>). Before heading
back to their home in the northern borderlands a week’s march to the
north, they planned to spend a few days in the large civilised city -
enjoying its delights and spending their recently acquired gold. They
quickly found themselves surrounded by the city guardsmen and required
to present themselves to the local Duke (technically their liege, as
their hometown was just inside his territory). He had a proposition. A
distant ally of the Duke required some irregular soldiers to deal with a
number of hostile nomads raiding his lands. If the party agreed to help
the ally he would pardon a number of treasonous offences they committed
in the course of their earlier adventures (aiding certain hostile
northern Elvish tribes). The party agreed and went to join the foreign
army as it assembled. Thus started <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_the_Desert_Nomads">Master of the Desert
Nomads</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>After completing a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/11/coursera-functional-programmin.html">Scala
course</a>
on <a href="http://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> in November, I was ready to try
another. Since I have an interest in astronomy I signed up for the <a href="http://duke.edu/">Duke
University</a> <a href="http://www.coursera.org/course/introastro">Introduction to
Astronomy</a> course. After
eight weeks of lectures and assignments it has just finished.</p>

<p>Whenever there is an astronomy documentary on TV, I usually tune in for
at least the first few minutes. Normally I turn them off fairly quickly
as most are aimed too low or just go too slow. The last one I watched
contained about 15 minutes worth of information in it’s 60 minutes run
time. There was no similar problem with this course. While it started
gently with positional astronomy and Newtonian physics, it quickly moved
on with a week each on planets, stars, stellar evolution, relativity,
galaxies and cosmology.</p>

<p>While many of the facts in the roughly 3-4 hours of lectures per week
were not new to me, the course also covered how those facts are
mathematically determined. Thus while a documentary my say something
like “after 10 billion years the Sun will start to expand”, this course
goes further. It presents the maths to calculate the amount of energy
released by nuclear reactions in a star’s core; how quickly the fuel for
these reactions is exhausted and how the pressure inside the star
changes at this point (including quantum effects like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure">electron
degeneracy
pressure</a>).
The maths stops just short of calculus (thus many formulas are presented
without derivation), so high school level is adequate to understand
everything presented.</p>

<p>There was an assignment every week requiring usage of the maths
presented to solve various problems. This is where the course let itself
down. The first assignment was hard, had a one week deadline and did not
inform the student where they were going wrong. After close to 16 hours
of effort I submitted on time and as the deadline passed received my
grade of 95%. Although I was quite proud, I did not have the time to
continue with the course if the future assignments continued in the same
fashion. The hours were not reasonable, especially for a course that
advised spending 6-8 total hours/week. However, it seemed that many
other people complained, so all further assignments had a 3 week
deadline, allowed multiple submissions and gave instant feedback. Still
assignments normally took me around 6 hours - so the course was an
unexpected time sink. Furthermore, the lectures and marking scheme often
contained mistakes that impacted assignment questions. It is extremely
frustrating to try solving a problem, getting feedback that it is wrong
and spending time trying to work out the error when it is in fact a
mistake caused by the lecturer! I soon learned to wait and only start
assignments after they had been available a week (by which time the
errors had been spotted and fixed).</p>

<p>A very interesting and informative class - unfortunately marred by
assignment errors and required more time than expected.</p>

    <p>Over last last weekend was both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day">Australia
Day</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaipusam">Thaipusam</a>. I went to both and
saw how they are celebrated here in KL in different ways.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/Flag_of_Australia.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Australia Day appears to be the premier event in the local diplomatic
community. The Australian diplomatic mission is one of the largest in
town and they aim to impress with their national day celebrations.
However, it wasn’t like any Australia Day event I’ve been to before. For
a start the invite said lounge suit. My memories of Australia Day are
t-shirt optional (because there is a pool) with a BBQ followed by
fireworks and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_J_Hottest_100">Hottest
#100</a>. The event
here is far swishier. It was held in a large exhibition hall, with
projection screens and unobjectionable Australian music playing.</p>

<p>My first impression was of a school ball. Not helped by the first food
station encountered being a chocolate fountain. Although after that the
comparison fails, with a large array of excellent food options
available, including Waygu beef,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamington">lamingtons</a> and a whole fresh
tuna flown in specially that day (morning in Australia, evening in KL).
All presented on little bite-sized dishes so it was easy to try a wide
range of dishes. The audience appeared to be largely the KL diplomatic
community with some local VIPs. Speaking to many of them, they were
deeply impressed with the event and the cost implied. It seems the
Australians set the bar high and dare other diplomatic mission to try
topping it. With austerity all the rage in the rest of world, I don’t
think anyone else makes the attempt.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/travel/thaipusam.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Thaipusan is a Hindu festival from southern India, where followers make
offerings to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murugan">Murugan</a>. This may
be in the form of a pot of milk or the hair from a freshly shaved head
or even piercing the body with needles and hooks. In Malaysia, the
holiday is held at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batu_Caves">Batu Caves</a>
with over a million visitors during the 3 day event.</p>

<p>We visited on the first night and rarely have I seen so many people. The
caves were packed shoulder to shoulder, as were the stairs upto the
caves and the assembly area. Around that was a large expanse of food
stalls, trinket shops, shrines, head shaving areas and more. All rammed
with more people. Gratifyingly, the large red crescent blood donation
area was also completely full. It was a bit overwhelming. There was loud
drumming, people hooked (literally) into decorated canopies, and colour
everywhere (mainly yellow). It was all quite good natured.</p>
