    <p>Imagine the scene: a person sits at their computer, credit card in hand,
about to happily pay money for a service they previously used for free.
A minute later, the credit card is back in their wallet unused. They
curse the service provider and vowing to never pay them money. They
furiously research alternatives to the service, it doesn’t take long to
find something suitable.</p>

<p>This happened to me last night. I have used Dropbox (no link as I don’t
want to give them even a small amount of Google link karma) for some
time and recently exceeded my space allowance. Fair enough, time to just
pay them the money and become a proper customer - their service had
worked very well for me. Navigating to their payment page I saw the cost
was a reasonable 99 US dollars, so I filled in the form. As I have a UK
credit card, I switched the country to the UK. And then the price
changed to 79 British pounds. Huh? 79 GBP is not 99 USD, it is 125 USD.
Dropbox wanted to charge me 25% more for not being American. The air
turned blue with expletives I don’t care to repeat. Come on Dropbox, are
foreign customers that much more expensive? Does it really cost that
much extra in net traffic fees to send all my data to the NSA? If it was
just a few percent extra I wouldn’t care, transaction costs and currency
fluctuations could explain it. But 25%, no way!</p>

<p>Never will I be a paying Dropbox customer, never will I have a nice
thing to say about them. It took barely a few minutes to find a
competing service to use instead. I don’t need them and will transition
to other systems. Another company for the <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-of-which-i-am-not-a.html">companies of which I am not a
customer</a>
list.</p>

    <p>Available from
<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/ancient-warfare-magazine/id274583068">iTunes</a>
and from <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/podcast/">its own
site</a></p>

<p>The Ancient Warfare Magazine Podcast, as the name implies, is produced
as part of the bi-monthly <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/">paper magazine of the same
name</a>. I’ve
never read the magazine, so I can’t comment on it. One episode of the
podcast is released for each issue of the magazine (although normally a
few months later) and on the same topic, such as the <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-v.1/">Gaius
Marius</a>,
<a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-vii.4/">Logistics</a>
or the <a href="http://www.karwansaraypublishers.com/pw/ancient-warfare/previous-issues/ancient-warfare-viii.4/">Seleucid Empire at
War</a>.
However the content is never just a repeat of the articles. Instead the
podcasts assumes the listener has read the corresponding magazine, or is
at least familiar with the topic at hand and then starts from there. The
format is a roundtable discussion for around half an hour, going
wherever the conversation leads. Production values are high.</p>

<p>This is not a basic history of events podcast. Listeners will need a
good understanding of ancient war and battles just to start. For
instance in discussing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Teutoburg_Forest">Battle of the Teutoburg
Forest</a>,
no mention is made of the battle or it’s result. Instead there is debate
on why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arminius">Arminus</a> decided to go
from ally to enemy of Rome, and how the battle caused terror in Rome
despite its distance. The podcast on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diadochi">Hellenistic Successor
States</a> assumes listeners know
the difference between the Greek <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hoplite">Hoplite
Phalanx</a> and the Macedonian
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarissa">Sarisa Phalanx</a>. Talk on
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar">Caesar’s</a> campaign’s
barely mentions his battles or career. It focuses entirely on his
self-aggrandisement and how he made his own luck partly with
well-trained, experienced and trusting soldiers - postulating he had no
grand plan, but just took advantage of situations as they occurred.</p>

<p>The discussion is normally quite interesting. There is a strong focus on
Greek, Hellenistic and Roman history, but not overwhelmingly so. Other
western and near eastern cultures are also represented. I would guess
the is roughly proportional to how much the remaining sources can tell
us (which is predominately Greek &amp; Roman as they tended to write things
down). However, it is disappointing that there is no mention (so far) of
cultures far from the Mediterranean - India, China, or the Americas.
Often some surprising thoughts come up. That the uniform of a Roman
legionary was anything but uniform (despite what the movies and TV
show), with the men modifying or replacing their equipment as they saw
fit. The huge advantage in steadfastness and maneuverability that came
with professional soldiers, be it Alexander’s phalanx, Athens’ rowers,
or Rome’s legions. How many generals had an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_the_Great">Alexander</a> complex,
comparing themselves to him (Caesar and Trajan) or mindlessly aping him - the successor kings even copied his slightly twisted neck. I was also
surprised to discover that
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad">Sargon</a> claimed to have
just over 5000 soldiers when he conquered Mesopotamia - armies were
clearly much smaller 4000 years ago.</p>

<p>An informative discussion-based podcast on narrowly focused (warfare
based) topics for listeners who already know the basic details.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>When recently in <a href="/blog/2015/05/vietnam.html">Vietnam</a> we mainly ate
streetfood (it is very good!), or food provided as part of an organised
tour. So there was not much opportunity to try out local fancy
restaurants. However, we did manage to have dinner at <a href="http://www.thehillstation.com/signature-restaurant/">Hill Station
Signature</a> while in
Sapa.</p>

<p>Located on the top of a ridge near the centre of Sapa, this restaurant
must have great views of the valley during the day. Although at night
the valley is very dark, so we could see little - not a huge problem as
we had spent the day hiking in that same valley. The cuisine is inspired
by the local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hmong_people">Hmong</a> and
quite different to traditional Vietnamese food. The decor is quite
trendy, lots of space. Some of the tables have seating on the floor
rather than chairs. Cost is fair for expensive than other places in
Sapa, but about the same a Hanoi restaurant (and a great deal cheaper
than London!) - our bill came to around £13.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was ill at the time we went and so could taste very
little of the food. Luckily, my partner was willing to describe the
food…</p>

<p>We shared black pudding, a pork dish and the trout. The black pudding
was a bit of a surprise. The flavour was good but it was cold and soft.
I like my back pudding hot and a bit crispy on the outside (I’m a big
fan normally but couldn’t finish this). The trout was beautifully
cooked, moist and flaky. But the star was probably the pork which was
tender and juicy and came in a tasty sauce mopped up with white rice. We
drank local beer. Despite the disappointment of the black pudding (which
I’d been looking forward to all day) it was a tasty meal with well
cooked quality ingredients and I would gladly go back if I find myself
in Sapa again.</p>

<p>Some time ago I finished the excellent and long-running history podcast
“The History of Rome” (detailed in blog posts
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2012/10/history-of-rome.html">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/06/history-of-rome-again.html">here</a>).
Now Mike Duncan is back with another extended podcast series, this time
on various revolutions. After 83 episodes, the series has covered the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War">English Revolution</a>,
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution">American
Revolution</a> and is
currently working through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Revolution">French
Revolution</a>. Apparently
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haitian_Revolution">Haitian
Revolution</a> will also
be detailed in future, but after that it is uncertain how much farther
it will go. As before, this series is well produced and Mike is an
excellent and interesting speaker. Each episode is around 25 minutes in
length (audio only) telling the history in chronological order.
Occasional supplemental episodes detail side stories or biographies not
directly related to the current episode, but germane to the revolution
as a whole.</p>

<p>So far I have listened to the 20 episodes on the English Revolution (not
counting the introduction on what defines a revolution). Knowing the
major events did not detract from the intriguing story. In 1642 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_I_of_England">Charles
I</a> called a
parliament to raise taxes to suppress a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishops%27_Wars">Scottish
rebellion</a> over his
attempts to enforce changes in religious dogma. At the time parliament
consisted solely of members of the English aristocracy and held legal
responsibility for creating and raising taxes. Safe to say the
parliamentary session did not go well. One of the Kings supporter’s
Stafford was executed after guilt by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_of_attainder">Bill of
Attainder</a> (where
parliament declares you guilty without a trial, it still exists in the
UK, but hasn’t been used sine 1782!). It ended with the King attempting
and failing to arrest 5 parliamentarians. Then both sides (King and
parliament) started raising armies. Mike suggests the war’s length was
extended by infighting on each side and the inexperience of their
soldiers (at least until the rise of a professional parliamentary army).
Eventually the King was captured, and after some more fighting,
executed. Britain became a republic under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell">Oliver
Cromwell</a>, but differences
over what that meant continued until his death, with a much weaker
monarchy restored soon afterwards under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell">Charles
II</a>.</p>

<p>The very legalistic nature of the conflict greatly surprised me. The
action took place as much in parliament as it did on the battlefield.
Each side took pains to justify their actions under existing or newly
created laws, albeit sometime only by greatly stretching their meaning.
The conflict often involved forcibly removing the unsupportive or adding
supportive members to parliament so that a particular law could be
passed. Once the King was captured there also seems to have been great
effort involved by nearly all sides in trying to keep him the King, but
with great disagreement under what conditions. After a short second war
when Charles I attempted to take advantage of the disunity by having the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_English_Civil_War">Scottish invade</a>
(unfortunately for him, unsuccessfully). The army <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride%27s_Purge">purged
parliament</a> of all those
opposing it (essentialy a coup), allowing a successful treason trial
against the King.</p>

<p>The revolution is also notable in that certain radical views became
relatively commonplace for a while. The
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levellers">Levellers</a> believed in
religious tolerance, universal male suffrage (rather than just for the
wealthy) and legal equality for all. While their views were unthinkable
at the start of the war, by the end they nearly managed to write the
English Constitution (which was ultimately never written). I have a
feeling they will come up again in the podcasts on the American
Revolution. There were also the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diggers">Diggers</a> a group who took the
Leveller manifesto and extended it to economic equality - becoming
something like Christian communists.</p>

<p>Very entertaining. This series is highly recommended.</p>
