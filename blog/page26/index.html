  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently stopped playing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering">Magic: The
Gathering</a> in person. After a <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2013/08/magic-the-gathering.html">brief spurt of
activity</a>,
I quickly slowed down to just playing the occasional pre-release or
other sealed tournaments, as much for the social event as the game.
However, over time my impression of the game has only diminished. It
takes too much time to play. Firstly there is the time taken to reach
the game store, then the time waiting for players to be ready to start.
If I get a return of one minute playing for two minutes waiting then I’m
doing well - often it is much worse!</p>

<p>Then there is the problem that many of the actual matches are just not
enjoyable. MtG relies on the concept of mana cards to act as a cost for
playing other cards. Unfortunately sometimes a player ends up with too
many or too few such cards (it is the luck of the draw) and as a result
might as well not be playing. In the “limited” games I tend to play
(“limited” format games do not reward paying extra for better cards, as
all the cards that can be played are provided to competitors at the
start) being “mana screwed” occurs to at least one of the players in
game roughly about 25% of the time. So around one in four of the games
are no fun (as I’m playing for the intellectual challenge, not to just
win).</p>

<p>So with increasingly little spare time, I decided to just stop playing.
But wait, what is this? A
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-to-play">free-to-play</a> version of
the game is now available online! Maybe this will solve my issues.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/mtg_duels.png"><img src="/assets/posts/games/mtg_duels.png" alt="Magic Duels" /></a></p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Magic Duels (the online version of Magic) is a bit of a mess. I am quite
unimpressed. Some parts are as expected. The games are always standard
format (but with a small subset of the tabletop cards), so it could only
be expected that the game would try to sell you the extra cards. Magic
is probably the original pay-to-win game. The more one pays, the better
cards they will have and thus better chances of winning their matches.
This is carried over into Magic Duels - fair enough. It would have been
nice if there were some limited format games as well, but maybe they
will come later. At least they provide a mechanism to get the extra
cards without paying, but just playing a great deal over time. Still the
need to pay to be decently competitive rankles - and I won’t pay, so am
always playing from a position of weakness.</p>

<p>Being able to choose your cards has not helped the “mana screwing”
problem either. In fact in this game it seems to be even worse - at
least at the initial stages when a player does not have many cards. The
issue is amplified by the computer opponents having the most incredible
luck imaginable. They never seem to have mana problems and often draw
just the card they need right when they need it. Urgh. Of course it is
possible this is just good luck and normal variance, but if so I’m way
off into the land of many standard deviations beyond average. More
likely the developer has fixed it and gone a little too far. I wouldn’t
be surprised considering the numerous other issues with the game. It is
slow: my PC can run some of the latest 3D games smoothly, but it takes
20 seconds to start a 2D card game from the in-game menu? Something is
not right there. The UI seems to be built for mobile devices - it would
make much more sense if I had a thumb sitting in the bottom right
corner, but I don’t. This means that the time given to play instants is
barely enough to realise what is happening and drag you mouse across the
screen. Magic is not supposed to be a test of reflexes! As a competitive
game, it uses an online connection to maintain state and when this
connection can’t be established the game can’t be played. And the
connection has been down often. Very often. There have also been
numerous bugs, missing quests and other annoyances.</p>

<p>Annoying is a good term too describe this game. The mana issues and
problems have just reminded me of the flaws inherent in the original
game’s design. I get the feeling that it just doesn’t respect its
player’s time. I can’t imagine playing Magic live again, and after this
I probably won’t bother with the computer version either. Maybe its time
to give Hearthstone a try.</p>

    <p>Work, work, work. Over the last few months, I have been working hard to
complete Concealed Intent to a saleable standard. It is already the
longest (2.5 years), largest (&gt;30K LOC) project I’ve ever undertaken,
and getting better all the time. It is even <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">available for download
here</a>
at the moment (warning: in a alpha testing state). That link will
continue to host the current version until the game goes on sale as part
of Steam Early Access.</p>

<p>How long until Early Access? I’ve tried to <a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2015/07/18/The-Best-Laid-Plans/">derive a plan over at my
work
blog</a>.
Early September is my target. The final run in is:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>31st July</strong> - v0.9.11: Rework some parts of GUI, like the stats
panel and loadout screens.</li>
  <li><strong>14th August</strong> - v0.9.12: 1v1 online play and supporting screens.</li>
  <li><strong>28th August</strong> - v0.9.13: Steam integration, 3 extra missions and
some AI rework.</li>
  <li><strong>?? September</strong> - Profit! (or at least, Steam Early Access!)</li>
</ul>

<p>Please <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/3yu64skebm7l7uw/AABcCp92zCI4hiTmjpRo2wV1a">take a look at the alpha
version</a>
if you can, and please leave feedback too (click ‘J’ at anytime in the

    <p>Finally success! For quite some time I have been trying to find a
computer game that my girlfriend will like. <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/06/too-many-game-reviews.html">To The
Moon</a>
and <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2015/06/the-walking-dead.html">The Walking Dead Season
1</a> only held
her attention for a matter of minutes. She completed <a href="http://www.cordinc.com/blog/2014/01/game-reviews.html">Thomas Was
Alone</a>, but
claimed not to enjoy the experience. Easy to believe considering her
tense shoulders and sweating while playing. But now there is a game that
she both finished and displayed happy entertainment during the game. The
next day I was even asked if there was another episode or sequel to play
next! What was the title that reached such lofty heights? <a href="http://www.herstorygame.com">Her
Story</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/her_story.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Her Story is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_motion_video">Full Motion
Video</a> detective game.
The basic idea is that the player is investigating a 20 year old murder
by going back through seven police interview tapes. Each tape is cut up
into short clips (of a few seconds through to a maximum couple of
minutes) recording the response to a question that is never shown. The
brilliant idea of the game is that the player can not just hit play and
start watching the videos from the start, nor can they just jump to the
end. Instead they can only interact with the game through a search box.
Type in a word (or phrase) and if it appears in one of the clips then
that clip will returned. Maybe. Only the first 5 clips in chronological
order are viewable, although you can see the number of matches. So our
first search, on the name of the person murdered, returned 61 clips, but
we could only watch the first 5. To get the rest we had to refine our
search or come at them from a different keyword (and direction). This is
immensely clever, I wish I thought of it first! The user interface is
simple, and intuitive to anyone who has used Google Search before (which
is everyone, right?). At the same time there is still a challenge as
most of the juicy stuff is in the later interviews.</p>

<p>It hard to say much more about the game as it is easily spoiled. Be
assured that the story is good no matter what angle you eventually come
at it. We certainly paid a great deal of attention to the dialogue,
trying to glean every ounce of information. As we discovered more, we
had to reconsider what was said earlier, as many of the clips can be
interpreted in multiple ways (the benefit of not hearing the question).
There are a few twists and many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring">red
herrings</a> (I think). As time
progressed we methodically worked our way through the clips following
particular lines of investigation - until there it was, the solution!
For us it took just under 2 hours (including a little bit of time after
knowing what had happened to discover why it had happened). In the end
we saw around 60% of the available clips. Looking online suggests most
people take closer to 3 hours. I think we were a little lucky to finish
that quickly - we were investigating a particular situation and the
search term returned the final clip (as well as another with the info we
actually intended). That that is the only concern I have with the game.
It is possible that a player could see the crucial clips almost straight
away, if they hit upon the right search terms. However, that is probably
unlikely as the obvious search terms are included in many clips, so the
most illuminating clips are not viewable until more refined search terms
are known. I can’t be sure, but I strongly suspect that the interview
text is minutely planned to avoid early spoiling - it certainly seemed
that way.</p>

<p>This is a clever game with a great story - definitely worth playing.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>About 2 hours before completing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(video_game)">The
Walking Dead</a> my opinion of the game changed, again, for the second
time. At first I liked it, then I found it disappointing, but by the end
I had grown an appreciation for the game. It is very enjoyable and has
probably the best story in any game I’ve played. Overall, I say it is
definitely in my top 10 games (since restarting gaming in 2011), but not
the top 5. Still a very good game.</p>

<p>The Walking Dead is a <a href="https://www.telltalegames.com">Telltale</a> game
based on the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(comic_book)">comic
book of the same name</a> (which now also has a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(TV_series)">TV
series</a> based on it too). For those not familiar with Telltale’s
distinctive style, it is a story game where the player is given a choice
of various dialogue or action options. The game then promises that other
characters will remember those responses and act appropriately (a little
message often pops up like “Kenny will remember you supported him”).
These interactions are interspersed with point &amp; click puzzle scenes and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_time_event">quick time events</a>. The
games are told in an episodic manner, each episode rising to a crescendo
and often a cliffhanger for the next. The first episode of a game is
often available for free download if you just want to see what its like - <a href="https://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead/season1/">The Walking Dead episode 1 download is
here</a>. Telltale
games’ art style is usually comic book like (so this one fits in great
with the source material).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/games/The-walking-dead-season-1.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>At first I was amazed. I was making these decisions and they were
affecting the story! Imagine the number of possibilities. Then by the
second episode I realised that I wasn’t really changing anything. The
game may tell me that people would remember, but it didn’t seem to make
any significant difference. This is understandable. It would be a
programming and artwork nightmare to allow a significantly branching
story. Instead the game branches out for no more than a few minutes and
then returns regularly to known narrative chokepoints. The main story
beats (about one every 30 minutes of gameplay) are fixed. Furthermore,
these moments are binary, the same two possible choices are always
presented regardless of previous actions. When it became clear to me how
the game was working under the hood I was greatly disappointed - it is
not what I thought was promised. It is definitely not a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure">choose your own
adventure</a>.
This combined with the point &amp; click sections of the game being either
very easy or devolving into annoying repetitive “hunt the pixel” puzzles
and the always irritating quick time events (some of which are designed
to be failed) started to put me off. However, the story was good, and
its not too long (each episode being around 2.5 hours) so I thought I’d
keep going.</p>

<p>I’m very glad I did finish it. After a few more episodes (including the
obligatory and cliched cannibal encounter) I began to see the point of
the game. It is not supposed to be a complex and branching story at all.
That conceit exists just to get the player involved and connected to the
characters. The real game is all about those binary story beats. They
are actually moral conundrums. The rest of the game and its faux
decisions are just trying to make the player care enough to consider
them properly and weigh the possible outcomes. They are decisions like
who gets food, or how much effort you make to save someone’s life in the
face of personal danger. Big questions, often with no good outcomes,
just equally bad, but slight different consequences. Such questions are
easily dismissed within most games. People die in games (and other forms
of entertainment) all the time - so what. The “trick” of The Walking
Dead is to add in all the other stuff around those decisions to make the
player take it seriously. And it works - largely. Most of the time I did
weigh the options carefully. In the end I didn’t even mind the quick
time events, they served to add some sense of jeopardy and action into
the story - stay awake! I also liked that at the end of each episode the
big decisions you made were highlighted and compared to other players’
decisions. On average I went with the same decision as the majority, but
a few times I was in the minority. This mechanic allows the player (me,
at least) to rethink their decisions when the pressure is off and
consider other points of view - I stand by all of them!</p>
