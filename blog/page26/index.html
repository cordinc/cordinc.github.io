      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/Funding Circle.html">Funding Circle</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A year on from <a href="/blog/2014/04/funding-circle-again.html">my last report</a>
and <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/">Funding Circle</a> (a peer-to-peer
lending website in the UK) is still going strong. It is approaching
nearly £600 million in funded loans. Whenever I check there is usually
50 or more loans available. It has been sometime since I saw a loan fail
to reach its funding minimum. The company has also expanded to property
development loans, albeit at a fixed rate rather than the normal auction
system (with first charge on the property).</p>

<p>So has the continued success of the company translated into improved
returns for the customers/investors? You may remember two year ago my
annual return (~2) was barely better than a bank deposit - largely due
to a rash of bankruptcies. Last year was better, the return was a
respectable 4.1 as recoveries picked up significantly. This year the
result is:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.3%<br />
After Fees: 7.3%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 6.3%</p>

<p>I consider that a very good return. It is roughly equivalent to the
return on the UK stock market
(<a href="https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/q?s=%5EFTSE">FTSE-100</a>) over the same
time period. The gross and after fees returns are roughly consistent
with last year, and recoveries were down a little. The difference in
return is down to bad debt more than halving.</p>

<p>Over all this time my investment system has not changed, no extra money
has been invested (but all profits reinvested). I only bid on loans
under 24 months, from profitable firms that are paying tax at the
expected rate and have positive working capital. People have asked about
the “paying tax filter” - these loans are to small companies unlikely to
have access to the tax minimisation systems heard about in the press.
Thus a company showing an accounting profit that is not paying roughly
the expected tax on that profit (given various UK tax breaks -
historical losses or research costs for example) should be a warning
sign there may be something strange going on in the accounts. I don’t
have the time to dig deeper into such firms - they are just cut at this
stage.</p>

<p>So if I haven’t changed anything, why has bad debt dropped? I’m not
sure. My bad debt rate is now about average compared to all investors.
It could be better risk management by Funding Circle, or just a more
favourable UK business environment. According to their <a href="https://www.fundingcircle.com/statistics">statistics
page</a>, bad debt on Funding
Circle loans made in the last couple of years has trended below
expectations. However, bad debt in loans made during the first two years
(2010-11), when I was an early adopter, have been much greater than
expected. This explains why my annualised return since joining the site
is 5.1% compared to the average of 5.7% for equivalent investors.</p>

<p>Decisions should be made on future benefits not historical costs. On
that basis I’m considering adding a little extra money to the capital.
There are a few concerning issues with the UK economy and I believe the
possibility of returning to the “bad years” is non-trivial. However, if
the return from Funding Circle is around 2% in the bad years, then it
seems a reasonable risk to take. I hope.</p>

    <p>A couple of numerically notable birthdays fell at the end of last year
and at the beginning of this year. To celebrate we made short weekend
trips to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langkawi">Langkawi</a> (November
2014) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangkok">Bangkok</a> (April 2015).
Neither holiday was particularly energetic, our main goal was relaxation
and eating. So I can’t say much about the tourist sites of either
destination, but I can say they are nice places to hang out.</p>

<p>The best photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/birthdays_15.html">available

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>A <a href="/blog/2015/02/carcassone-and-agricola.html">previous post</a> mentioned
that I’ve started playing board games. So far my favourite 2-player
board-game is the award winning
<a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30549/pandemic"><strong>Pandemic</strong></a> (the
game teased in that previous post). This game plays incredibly well with
anywhere from 2 to 4 people, and would probably still work even played
solo. This is because in Pandemic players are not competing against each
other. Instead everyone cooperates as a team against the board game
itself.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_box.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_box.jpg" title="Pandemic Box" width="350" alt="Pandemic Box" /></a></p>

<p>The aim of Pandemic is prevent overwhelming waves of disease spreading
across the globe, and victory is achieved by curing them. If there are
too many disease outbreaks or time runs out, then the game is lost. The
board is a map of major world cities with little coloured cubes to
denote the prevalence of particular diseases. Players take on the role
of various <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">CDC</a> employees, each with their own
special abilities. Each turn there are various possible actions: move
around the globe; treat disease in the current city; work towards a
cure; and more. At the end of each turn players collect cards from the
“player deck” which can be used to either speed movement or aid cure
research. A card can be used for one or the other, but not both. This
sets up a nice dilemma - use a card to travel quickly to a hot zone or
save it towards a long-term cure. These cards can also be traded between
players, but only if they are both in the appropriate city. This
complicates teamwork, as being spread out helps contain disease quickly,
but being close aids research through card trading. After the player
cards comes the infection stage, when a few cities have the amount of
disease in them increased. If there is too much disease in a city then
an outbreak occurs, spreading to neighboring cities.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_board.jpg"><img src="/assets/posts/games/pandemic_board.jpg" title="A bad start" width="500" alt="A bad start" /></a></p>

<p>The brilliance of the game comes from its pacing. If the game was
entirely as described above then players could formulate long-term plans
towards cures, and then steadily move forwards with occasional
diversions for threatening situations. Instead, there are epidemics and
a resulting period of panic as everything seems to be going wrong. In
the player deck are between 4 to 6 epidemic cards. The number of such
cards determines the game’s difficulty. When an epidemic card is drawn a
random new city is given the maximum amount of disease. Then that city’s
infection card, and all the previously drawn infection cities and
shuffled and placed back on the top of the infection deck. BACK ON THE
TOP! This means that all the previously infected cities will soon be
infected again, and if they haven’t been treated then there is a good
chance of an outbreak.</p>

<p>This great mechanic brings a little bit of stress to the game. Plans
tend to fall apart once an epidemic occurs. Getting two such cards in
quick succession mean the players will struggle for some time to get
back to a state where they can plan cures. The way the rules suggest
shuffling the cards prevents 3 epidemics in a row - because such an
event would almost certainly mean the end of the game. Each game I’ve
played so far has been a rollercoaster, the careful execution of plans
punctuated by setbacks from epidemics. It is also very well balanced, my
win rate has been around 50% (but getting better as I’m still learning),
but I also haven’t tried the hardest 6-epidemic version yet.</p>

<p>A game takes about 45 minutes to complete, but another 5 minutes to set
up. The production values are high, all the components feel well-made
(out of plastic and cardboard). There are a number of expansion sets,
but I haven’t played them. There are also some alternative “scenarios”
online - essentially alternative rules. I found a couple of official
scenarios while writing this, available
<a href="http://zmangames.com/goodies/Pandemic_Government-Shutdown.pdf">here</a>,
and <a href="http://zmangames.com/goodies/Pandemic_Isolation.pdf">here</a>. I’ll
have to give them a try.</p>

<p>Pandemic is a game that gets so much right. The pacing and balance is
near perfect. The idea of a cooperative board game is new to me, but
works very well. I can highly recommend giving this game a try if you
have the chance.</p>

    <p>This year I went to the <a href="http://www.gdconf.com/">Game Developer’s Conference
(GDC)</a>, held every year in San Francisco
(usually sometime in March). I have written about my impression of the
conference
<a href="http://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2015/03/15/Know-Thyself/">here</a>. The
short version is it was both inspiring and depressing. So this post is
just a link to some photos and interesting points.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 40 years I have never seen anyone defecate on the street. A claim
I can no longer make after a week in San Francisco - I have now seen it
twice. I will definitely stay in a better area of the city next time I
go.</li>
  <li>Apple laptops were everywhere, spotting a PC laptop was quite a rare
occurrence. Surface tablets were about as common as iPads, and Android
phones outnumbered iPhones.</li>
  <li>A couple of speakers espoused taking your own path in indie game
development and being original, but were introduced as having worked on
anodyne AAA games.</li>
  <li>The Valve expo booth screamed “go away”, I think the designer must
have studied some <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/18/defensive-architecture-keeps-poverty-undeen-and-makes-us-more-hostile">defensive
architecture</a>.</li>
  <li>At least 10 expo booths were showing some sort of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality">VR</a> equipment or
software.</li>

    <p>The last fortnight I have been very busy starting the marketing on
Concealed Intent. Sadly (to me) I haven’t had much time to write code.
Far more time has been spent writing words in order to let people know
about the game.</p>

<iframe src="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/widget/394572500" width="336" height="137" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>Just a couple of days ago I put Concealed Intent up on Steam Greenlight.
If you have a Steam account, please go <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=394572500">vote for it
here</a>.
Feel free to have your friends, acquaintances or just passersby vote for
it too.</p>

<p>For those who don’t know, Greenlight is the way for Indies to get their
games on Steam, the largest PC/Mac game distribution platform. It is
very important to any PC/Mac game’s success. It can take several months
to get through the Greenlight popularity contest (there is no time
limit), which is why I have started now, some months before completing
the game.</p>

<p>There is also a video trailer of the game in action on the Greenlight
page, or you can see it YouTube below.</p>
