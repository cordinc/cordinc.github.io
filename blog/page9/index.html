<p>Unleash your inner misanthrope along with a deadly disease! In <a href="http://www.ndemiccreations.com/en/25-plague-inc-evolved">Plague
Inc: Evolved</a>
the player is a disease intent on the eradication of humanity. Very
grim, but strangely addictive and well-made.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cq68L3z3D90" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Plague Inc the player is one of various diseases, initially mostly
harmless, but with grand plans to destroy humanity. That is the game’s
goal: kill all humans. Leaving a single person alive is considered
mission failure. Progress towards success is achieved by gathering “DNA
points” (partially by clicking bubbles as they appear on the map), and
then spending them on various mutations - giving your disease improved
infectiousness, seriousness, lethality or other effects. That is it.
Simple, but effective and well-made. The graphics are good and there is
lots of easy to find information on what is happening.</p>

<p>Each game of Plague Inc becomes a battle between infecting as many
people as fast as possible, without killing them too quickly, and
finishing the job before humans find a cure. Games last 20-30 minutes
and every game I have played was close at the end. There are also many
new scenarios, diseases and power-ups that become available as you
complete earlier missions. With a feel half-way between a board-game and
a clicker game, Plague Inc: Evolved is clearly inspired by modern,
casual game design. It is easy to pick and play a quick game. I often
had that “one more try” feeling.</p>

<p>Plague Inc: Evolved is US$14.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/246620/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.
There is also a mobile version. It has been bundled.</p>

<p>Do you spend ages staring at those pretty minimalist subway maps? Or
maybe it is called the metro or underground in your part of the globe.
It doesn’t matter! <a href="https://dinopoloclub.com/minimetro/">Mini Metro</a>
sets you loose to design subway systems worldwide, with its engaging
gameplay and super high level of polish.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWDGWv4bCJ8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This game is about laying the tracks for a city’s subway. Just drag the
mouse between stations and like magic there is a metro line between them
with running trains ferrying people to their destination. That is Mini
Metro. Not much to it, but addictive, and extremely well-made. Of course
there is a little bit more, organising the lines to ensure that people
get were they are going promptly may require some rearrangement. As the
game progresses extra stations appear, while the player gets more lines
available, or more trains, bridges, station upgrades, and other things.
The game ends if someone has to wait too long at a station before
getting on a train. There are many game modes, daily changes and
missions set in every world city with a subway.</p>

<p>The design of this game is excellent. The controls are super smooth and
need very little explanation. The graphics are beautiful in that
colourful abstract style common to subway maps. What is happening in the
game is always clear without the use of text. For example, stations are
displayed as various shapes, meanwhile people travelling are also
displayed as smaller versions of the same shapes, their particular shape
being the destination to which they are travelling. It seems obvious and
intuitive when you see it, but that is just the mark of clever design.
Everything in Mini Metro works as expected - just brilliant, and so
pretty. I love it.</p>

<p>Mini Metro is US$9.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/287980/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.
There is also a mobile version. It has been bundled.</p>

<p>Want to be a government landlord in a totalitarian regime? Want to
steal, blackmail and spy on your tenants? Then you are in luck in the
dark indie game <a href="https://beholder-game.com/">Beholder</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ioydoZi4Aj4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This game is really about evoking the atmosphere, and the stories, of
living in a depressing dictatorship. The player’s avatar is the landlord
of a government housing building. He job is to complete the tasks sent
regularly from his employers, family, and sometimes mysterious others.
To complete them you move around the side-on building and interact with
various items and talk to people. Sometime you have to complete
bureaucratic reports - make sure all the fields are correctly filled, or
you will have to do it again! The actual mechanics of the game become
quickly repetitive. Whether you enjoy it will depend greatly on whether
the stories and setting are interesting to you. The player is forced to
make decisions where no outcome is positive. Beholder is a decidedly
downbeat game - dark in both tone and graphics (it is often hard to see
what is happening). To me it is more interesting than entertaining.</p>

<p>Beholder is US$9.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/475550/">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.

<p>Be a God! Well, not much of a god. Be a minor deity of a pet floating
space mountain with very little you can do! That is a more accurate
description for <a href="http://mountain-game.com/">Mountain</a>. Or perhaps it
should just be called an ambient experience instead of a game?</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EGqRMSzEZfs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>After a short bit of drawing (presumably to seed the random number
generator) the player can view their new mountain, and that is largely
the game. You don’t do much, mainly watch your mountain as it slow
rotates through space, suffering various impacts and storms. I like the
honesty on the controls option screen, “No Controls”. Not quite true,
players can control the camera and make musical notes by hitting certain
keys (supposedly certain tunes initiate events). Otherwise you just
watch. Luckily it is quite pretty, often with
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._W._Turner">Turneresque</a> lighting.
Perhaps it is a comment on “what is a game?” Or maybe just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock">pet
rock</a> project. Mildly
entertaining, for a little bit.</p>

<p>What is a more natural fit than a cross between Tetris and a dungeon
crawler? Err, everything probably. However, Dungetris shows the concept
can work… up to a point. This game is a good start, but lacks polish,
leaving the player badly exposed to the random number generator.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jPPSw4qXwjM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In Dungetris the player explores a castle in traditional rogue-like
style. The originality comes from how that castle is constructed. It is
built up from room blocks dropping down onto the current setup. These
randomly selected blocks can be repositioned (but not rotated) by the
player before dropping. Once dropped they become part of the structure.
Sometimes they block paths through to other rooms, or sometimes open up
previously blocked paths. Each new block may contain monsters or
treasure or other things and you can see these before deciding where to
place it. I love the ingenuity of this game mechanic, and it is the best
part of the game.</p>

<p>The problem is that the game is extremely random. The castle layout
rapidly becomes a mess, and the mission goals often require luck that
certain blocks or items drop. Early levels last about 5 minutes, but a
later mission keep going for over 40 minutes without a single one of the
required 15 specific monsters dropping - very annoying! A nice (and
surprising) idea, let down by huge over reliance on the random number
generator. In the end I just gave up after deciding it was more a game
of luck, than skill.</p>

<p>Dungetris is US$14.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/462200/">Steam
store</a> for PC only.</p>
