  <div class="content">
    <p>I have being hearing people talking about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> recently, and as the
designated ‘techie’ some people ask me what it is (the subtext being
“should I buy some?”). I am always hesitant to say much in such
situations (no one has ever made money listening to my financial
advice!). For the interested, there are many good descriptions of the
fundamental technology online (most of my knowledge comes from this
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency">Coursera Cryptocurrency
course</a>). I also mined
some cryptocurrencies (<a href="/blog/2013/11/computer-gold-rush.html">results detailed in this blog
post</a>), but stopped very quickly
after calculating the profit vs cost. I have never owned any Bitcoin,
and have no immediate plans to change that.</p>

<p>Basically, I probably know enough to be dangerous, but falling victim to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger
effect</a>
seems appropriate for
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dunning-krugerrand">Dunning-Krugerrands</a>.
Take everything written here with that in mind.</p>

<p>Firstly, most conversations on the utility or value of Bitcoin need to
separate the cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) from the underlying technology
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a>). Blockchain
seems like a very clever solution to the problem of distributed trust
(i.e. a system where you do not need to trust anyone involved in the
system but are still able to trust the system itself), produced by
assuming that no one can control over 50% of the system. Bitcoin is the
proof-of-concept application of Blockchain, with the added benefit that
the value of the cryptocurrency encourages people to join the trust
system (by mining) and thus decreases the likelihood of anyone
controlling over 50% (also clever!).</p>

<p>As just a technology, the value of Blockchain depends on where it has
been applied. Sometimes it will be useful, and sometimes not. At the
moment it is the hot new technology and everyone seems to be using
wherever they can. As I’ve seen with previously hot technologies, I
suspect it will greatly overused in areas it is not applicable - beware!
Still I can easily imagine places it would be helpful - it would be
great for tracking ownerships of items/land in corrupt countries
(although I suspect those are the last places that would adopt such a
system for the same reason!).</p>

<p>Right now, there are five main reasons I don’t like Bitcoin. However,
each of those reasons is surmountable with time and the advancement of
technology. So while I think the Bitcoin is currently flawed and not
worth the hype, I can believe that it has future potential (or more
likely a successor cryptocurrency does). I’m sure all of these problems
are being worked upon actively (and know of a few such efforts). A
cryptocurrency that solves them all will probably be worthwhile.</p>

<p>The problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is no use for the mining calculation, it just burns
electricity (and a lot of it!). To be part of the Bitcoin system by
mining means performing a useless computation just to act as
“proof-of-work” and randomise who proposes the next block. It would
be great if this calculation had inherent value (like for instance
drug discovery). However, it is hard to find a useful calculation
that has the required mathematical properties.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and therefore no floor price.
Cryptocurrencies have no backing (other than perhaps
<a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a>). There is nothing to say the price
should not be 0 or millions. This makes it hard to act as a store of
value - holding it is currently speculation. If it was widely used
for purchases then that would be something, or if the mining
calculation had value. For comparison, commodities (like gold) have
value in the industrial uses of that commodity; national currencies
have the backing of their government, and even if you don’t trust
them, you can still pay your taxes in that currency.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin is deflationary due to a fixed total size. While the total
amount of Bitcoin in circulation is currently growing, at a certain
point in the future this will stop. The Bitcoin system has a maximum
amount of coin built into it, and when reached no more will be
added. A currency that doesn’t grow makes the economy based on that
currency hard to grow. It encourages people not to spend it as it
will likely be worth more in the future (thus deflationary).</li>
  <li>Slow transaction speed and thus high fees. Bitcoin can handle a
maximum of 7 transactions per second - worldwide! Only 7 people can
use Bitcoin in the same second! This is several orders of magnitude
less than any serious online payment system or credit card. The low
number of transactions means people have to pay fees to have miners
to include their transactions at the front of the queue. Everyone
else waits. As the demand for Bitcoin increases, so will the number
of transactions and the size of the fees.</li>
  <li>Few to no legal protections. One of the touted benefits of Bitcoin
is that is not controlled by anyone, and thus safe from government
interference or devaluation. However, this also means it is not
protected. Scams and thefts of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are
common with victims seeming to have little recourse. I don’t think
the level of corruption in the countries I reside is a serious
problem for their currencies (yet) and their central banks generally
do more good than harm - so I am happy to provisionally trust my
wealth to government currencies. I would struggle to say the same
for any cryptocurrency.</li>
</ol>

    <p>The shortest job I ever had was just 8 weeks - half of which was serving
out my notice period! It was my “summer job”, as it was just for June
and July 2005. Once my <a href="/blog/2016/09/rbs-2.html">RBS contract</a> ended, a
serious search for the next job began. There were a few bad interviews,
an awful experience with a pushy dishonest recruitment agent, and a
clearly best offer. Unfortunately it did not work out.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>So after four and a half years in Kuala Lumpur, we have returned to
London. My first impression? It is cold here. It has been quite a shock
to go from the tropics to a Northern European climate. Plus, it is
summer! Winter is coming, and I am not looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Other than that London seems vaguely the same. It is still incredibly
expensive. The media continues to be full of stories of either impending
disaster or glorious future success - depending on the proprietor’s
political leanings. When we left it was Austerity, now it is Brexit. The
trains are still broken on an alarmingly regular basis for what seem
like nonsense reasons. Companies say nice things and are polite in
public, but obviously couldn’t care less when time to get things done.
People are everywhere, everything seems crowded, everyone is super busy.</p>

<p>Forgotten when I left, but quickly remembered on return: terrorism
motivated attacks are common enough to be largely ignored by the local
populace. Seriously, I have never seen a Londoner concerned about the
London terrorist incidents that dominate the international news when
they occur. If you ever see a news item claiming that Londoners are
feeling scared, worried or “under siege” then they are talking nonsense.</p>

<p>There have been a few small changes too. Contactless payments are
ubiquitous. I tried to pay for my lunch with cash soon after arriving
and got a very dirty look from the cashier as they made an exaggerated
gesture to open the till. It is as if I was an old man counting out
pennies, which I suppose I was from a customer throughput point of view.
There is also a huge increase in the number of “gentleman’s barbers”.
Male grooming is definitely more overt. Hipsters abound!</p>

<p>Overall, I can not claim to be happy to be back. That is despite finding
a job very quickly in an interesting fintech AI startup. It has also
been good to catch up with old friends. I will probably be required by
work to stay in town over the coming months. However, I sincerely hope
this will be my last ever London winter.</p>

    <p><em>This post is from the now defunct website “A GameDev Plays…”, copied here for posterity</em></p>

<p>What happens after a drunken one night stand? Find out in the awkward
short story game <a href="http://www.gamesbykinmoku.com/one-night-stand.html">One Night
Stand</a>.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MijKDEgn6kY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>You wake up, head throbbing, in a strange flat next to an unknown naked
woman. What do you do? What do you say? One Stand Stand is a point &amp;
click story game that starts with that premise. You can try to get to
know the woman better or sneak out or take a look around. Each game
lasts around 30 minutes and your decisions can lead to 12 different
endings. However it feels weird to replay the game as you already know
so much about this woman from previous run-throughs - it seems unfair
(just knowing her name is a spoiler). Still this short and tightly
focussed game delivers its story well and never gives the impression of
cheating or forcefully directing the player (probably because it is
short and focussed). One of the more successful story games I’ve played
and well worth a look if you enjoy this genre.</p>

<p>One Night Stand is US$2.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/549860">Steam
store</a> for PC, Mac and Linux.</p>

<p>Just one more game, just one more. Wait, where did that hour go?
<a href="http://www.pentadact.com/2017-03-03-morphblade-is-out/">Morphblade</a> is
an addictive well-made casual strategy game, where the actions you can
perform depend directly on where you are located.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c5iKZXVHkKs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>Sometimes simple game mechanics rules can build to a deep tactical
gameplay. Morphblade is played on an expanding hex grid where the player
is battling waves of various types of bugs. The problem is that the
actions that the player can perform are completely defined by the type
of hex on which they are located. On a Hammer hex bugs can be smashed to
pieces, on a Health hex damage can be repaired, Acid hexes strip armour
from bugs, and so on. Each type of hex also has different rules for how
it can be upgraded. On a small playing area where you are forced to move
each turn, this game quickly requires planning several moves ahead in
order to progress. Bad luck is kept in check by the fixed order that
enemies appear, but memorising moves won’t work as the initial location
of the enemies and the hexes added to the grid are random. Morphblade is
very addictive. Games last 5-10 minutes of mostly thinking and the
player always knows what they did wrong, so the temptation is always to
try again. Morphblade is a great simple tactical game.</p>

<p>Morphblade is US$4.99 on the <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/494720/">Steam
store</a> for PC only.</p>
