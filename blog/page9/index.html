  <div class="content">
    <p>Last year I expected to significantly reduce the <a href="/blog/tag/Funding%20Circle.html">balance of my Funding
Circle account</a> over the following
year. Well, the year has passed and a noticeable amount has been
withdrawn, but there is still enough there to get an idea of the
returns. So, what happened over the last year?</p>

<p>Here are the returns for the last UK tax year:</p>

<p>Gross: 8.5%<br />
After Fees: 7.5%<br />
After Bad Debt &amp; Recoveries: 6.4%</p>

<p>A lower return than last year (7%), but still a decent return, although
not as good as other investments . Gross returns and fees have stayed
roughly steady compared to last year. The decrease has come from an
increase in net bad debts. It would be nice to think this is due to
Brexit issues or a change in the site’s system reducing choice (see
below), but I doubt it. I’m fairly sure the rise in bad debts is due to
a couple of the real estate loans I added last year going under in the
dropping UK property market. Based on the loan-equity ratios for those
loans I would expect recoveries to be very high, but that takes time,
and right now the loss has to be realised.</p>

<p>Since the last report, Funding Circle have changed their system again.
It is no longer possible to choose the individual loans, instead clients
are forced to go into an automatic system based on two credit rating
buckets. I have gone for the A rated loans. Will lower customer
involvement result in better returns? I’m not sure in the current
environment. Thus I will continue to slowly drain funds from the
account.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Again with the goals! Over the last year I have left Kuala Lumpur, and
spent over half a year back in London. <a href="/blog/tag/Concealed%20Intent.html">Concealed
Intent</a> has not made enough money to
live in London, so I had to get a job. Now I work in FinTech startup,
and it consumes a great deal of my time and energy. As a result there
has been little time to meet <a href="/blog/2012/16/goals-5.html">last years
goals</a> and my progress has suffered.</p>

<p><strong>Create and release a game</strong> and <strong>blog on my websites at least 4 times
a month</strong> are both failed goals. I do have 3 prototype games, but took
none of them further (yet). There was also a months work to release the
1.2 update of Concealed Intent. My blogging got close to the 48 posts
required, although still fell short. There were only 9 posts on this
blog - most in the first half of the year (before the move to London),
and not enough on the others to make up the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Exercise</strong> and <strong>learn Spanish</strong> went much better - I think these can
be marked as successful. I kept up around 10-15 minutes of Spanish per
day, even through the move. I have completed the beginner courses on two
websites and will start an online intermediate course soon. However,
having listened to a few intermediate level Spanish podcasts, I am not
at that level yet - I am between beginner and intermediate. In the first
half of 2017 I set personal bests in various weights exercises. In the
second half I lost a great deal of weight while maintaining strength a
little below those PBs.</p>

<p>This years my goals are much less ambitious and more vague. Keep
exercising, keep learning Spanish, blog occasionally, release a 1.3
update to Concealed Intent (the last one) and, if I have the time, do
some game dev. That is it, nothing too onerous. Under the circumstances
I can’t promise more.</p>

  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I have being hearing people talking about
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> recently, and as the
designated ‘techie’ some people ask me what it is (the subtext being
“should I buy some?”). I am always hesitant to say much in such
situations (no one has ever made money listening to my financial
advice!). For the interested, there are many good descriptions of the
fundamental technology online (most of my knowledge comes from this
<a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/cryptocurrency">Coursera Cryptocurrency
course</a>). I also mined
some cryptocurrencies (<a href="/blog/2013/11/computer-gold-rush.html">results detailed in this blog
post</a>), but stopped very quickly
after calculating the profit vs cost. I have never owned any Bitcoin,
and have no immediate plans to change that.</p>

<p>Basically, I probably know enough to be dangerous, but falling victim to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">Dunning-Kruger
effect</a>
seems appropriate for
<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dunning-krugerrand">Dunning-Krugerrands</a>.
Take everything written here with that in mind.</p>

<p>Firstly, most conversations on the utility or value of Bitcoin need to
separate the cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) from the underlying technology
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain">Blockchain</a>). Blockchain
seems like a very clever solution to the problem of distributed trust
(i.e. a system where you do not need to trust anyone involved in the
system but are still able to trust the system itself), produced by
assuming that no one can control over 50% of the system. Bitcoin is the
proof-of-concept application of Blockchain, with the added benefit that
the value of the cryptocurrency encourages people to join the trust
system (by mining) and thus decreases the likelihood of anyone
controlling over 50% (also clever!).</p>

<p>As just a technology, the value of Blockchain depends on where it has
been applied. Sometimes it will be useful, and sometimes not. At the
moment it is the hot new technology and everyone seems to be using
wherever they can. As I’ve seen with previously hot technologies, I
suspect it will greatly overused in areas it is not applicable - beware!
Still I can easily imagine places it would be helpful - it would be
great for tracking ownerships of items/land in corrupt countries
(although I suspect those are the last places that would adopt such a
system for the same reason!).</p>

<p>Right now, there are five main reasons I don’t like Bitcoin. However,
each of those reasons is surmountable with time and the advancement of
technology. So while I think the Bitcoin is currently flawed and not
worth the hype, I can believe that it has future potential (or more
likely a successor cryptocurrency does). I’m sure all of these problems
are being worked upon actively (and know of a few such efforts). A
cryptocurrency that solves them all will probably be worthwhile.</p>

<p>The problems:</p>

<ol>
  <li>There is no use for the mining calculation, it just burns
electricity (and a lot of it!). To be part of the Bitcoin system by
mining means performing a useless computation just to act as
“proof-of-work” and randomise who proposes the next block. It would
be great if this calculation had inherent value (like for instance
drug discovery). However, it is hard to find a useful calculation
that has the required mathematical properties.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and therefore no floor price.
Cryptocurrencies have no backing (other than perhaps
<a href="https://tether.to/">Tether</a>). There is nothing to say the price
should not be 0 or millions. This makes it hard to act as a store of
value - holding it is currently speculation. If it was widely used
for purchases then that would be something, or if the mining
calculation had value. For comparison, commodities (like gold) have
value in the industrial uses of that commodity; national currencies
have the backing of their government, and even if you don’t trust
them, you can still pay your taxes in that currency.</li>
  <li>Bitcoin is deflationary due to a fixed total size. While the total
amount of Bitcoin in circulation is currently growing, at a certain
point in the future this will stop. The Bitcoin system has a maximum
amount of coin built into it, and when reached no more will be
added. A currency that doesn’t grow makes the economy based on that
currency hard to grow. It encourages people not to spend it as it
will likely be worth more in the future (thus deflationary).</li>
  <li>Slow transaction speed and thus high fees. Bitcoin can handle a
maximum of 7 transactions per second - worldwide! Only 7 people can
use Bitcoin in the same second! This is several orders of magnitude
less than any serious online payment system or credit card. The low
number of transactions means people have to pay fees to have miners
to include their transactions at the front of the queue. Everyone
else waits. As the demand for Bitcoin increases, so will the number
of transactions and the size of the fees.</li>
  <li>Few to no legal protections. One of the touted benefits of Bitcoin
is that is not controlled by anyone, and thus safe from government
interference or devaluation. However, this also means it is not
protected. Scams and thefts of Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are
common with victims seeming to have little recourse. I don’t think
the level of corruption in the countries I reside is a serious
problem for their currencies (yet) and their central banks generally
do more good than harm - so I am happy to provisionally trust my
wealth to government currencies. I would struggle to say the same
for any cryptocurrency.</li>
</ol>

    <p>The shortest job I ever had was just 8 weeks - half of which was serving
out my notice period! It was my “summer job”, as it was just for June
and July 2005. Once my <a href="/blog/2016/09/rbs-2.html">RBS contract</a> ended, a
serious search for the next job began. There were a few bad interviews,
an awful experience with a pushy dishonest recruitment agent, and a
clearly best offer. Unfortunately it did not work out.</p>

    <p>So after four and a half years in Kuala Lumpur, we have returned to
London. My first impression? It is cold here. It has been quite a shock
to go from the tropics to a Northern European climate. Plus, it is
summer! Winter is coming, and I am not looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Other than that London seems vaguely the same. It is still incredibly
expensive. The media continues to be full of stories of either impending
disaster or glorious future success - depending on the proprietor’s
political leanings. When we left it was Austerity, now it is Brexit. The
trains are still broken on an alarmingly regular basis for what seem
like nonsense reasons. Companies say nice things and are polite in
public, but obviously couldn’t care less when time to get things done.
People are everywhere, everything seems crowded, everyone is super busy.</p>

<p>Forgotten when I left, but quickly remembered on return: terrorism
motivated attacks are common enough to be largely ignored by the local
populace. Seriously, I have never seen a Londoner concerned about the
London terrorist incidents that dominate the international news when
they occur. If you ever see a news item claiming that Londoners are
feeling scared, worried or “under siege” then they are talking nonsense.</p>

<p>There have been a few small changes too. Contactless payments are
ubiquitous. I tried to pay for my lunch with cash soon after arriving
and got a very dirty look from the cashier as they made an exaggerated
gesture to open the till. It is as if I was an old man counting out
pennies, which I suppose I was from a customer throughput point of view.
There is also a huge increase in the number of “gentleman’s barbers”.
Male grooming is definitely more overt. Hipsters abound!</p>

<p>Overall, I can not claim to be happy to be back. That is despite finding
a job very quickly in an interesting fintech AI startup. It has also
been good to catch up with old friends. I will probably be required by
work to stay in town over the coming months. However, I sincerely hope
this will be my last ever London winter.</p>
