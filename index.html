    <p>A couple of weeks after travelling to <a href="/blog/2025/04/sri-lanka.html">Sri Lanka</a>, I went a few hours south to spend a long weekend in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bunbury,_Western_Australia">Bunbury</a> and its surrounds. It is amazing how it becomes noticeably cooler and greener with such just a short journey. Walking around Bunbury is easy and pretty, although you are finished quickly since the town is surprisingly small. There is one main street, a couple of malls and a couple of streets full of big box stores. Restaurant selection is limited. The farmers market is still a great food-only supermarket. Prices seemed largely the same as Perth. Overall it felt like a large successful country town, which I suppose it is.</p>

<p>Other places visited:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnybrook,_Western_Australia">Donnybrook</a> Apple Festival is very popular, it felt like there were thousands of visitors taking over this small town! And it does not seem to have much to do with apples - there was just a single stall selling apples (very tasty!) and few others selling “related” products. The event seems like a cross between a small agricultural show and and a large standard market.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australind,_Western_Australia">Australind</a> felt like a commuter suburb. There was a nice Italian restaurant though (forgotten its name).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busselton">Busselton</a> has become a tourist town. Despite being much smaller, the main shopping street was nearly as large as Bunbury’s. However, the shops there felt like they were mostly for visitors.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>At the star of April I spent a fortnight in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka">Sri Lanka</a> for a wedding. Perhaps half the time was spent on travelling (see below) and the wedding activities, but we managed some sightseeing along the way. Overall it seems like a nice place to visit, although I’m in no rush to go back (despite missing some good stuff like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigiriya">Sigiriya</a>). People have said it is similar to the Bali of 30 years ago. I can see that, it seems to be a good place to relax by the beach. Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are surprisingly few restaurants everywhere we went (except the Negombo tourist strip). We probably only had 3 meals at local eateries, and that took some effort. I thought perhaps they were there, but I wasn’t looking for the right signs. However, I checked with various online maps, then confirmed by talking to locals and other tourists. Apparently Sri Lankans don’t tend to eat out often and tourists spend most of their time at touristy places (so outside those places good luck!).</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo">Colombo</a> is jarring mix of run down building and new towers, often very close to eachother.</li>
  <li>You are dangerously gem deficient! Walking around the capital we were regularly approached by initially friendly men who quickly told us that we were lucky to be in town that day as there was a special one-day only sale at the best gem store in town. We must go! This was over many different days and stores. One was a little aggressive, but all eventually accepted we weren’t going anywhere with them.</li>
  <li>Expect to pay more as a non-local, sometimes by a lot. For example, when a taxi wanted more from us than a equivalent Australian taxi (which are not cheap) we tried Uber and got a car at tenth of the asking price.</li>
  <li>Security sometimes can be very tight, other times non-existent. Going into hotels and shopping malls we went through metal detectors and bag checks. However, other places like train stations had no security, often not even a ticket check. There was no visible security on the streets either (although it still felt safe). Presumably this is a holdover from the long finished <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_civil_war">civil war</a> and more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Sri_Lankan_protests">recent protests</a>.</li>
  <li>The train network is extensive and amazingly cheap, but incredibly slow and often delayed. Don’t be overly concerned about going in the lower classes as long as you have a set seat. We went in reserved 3rd class for one trip - it was fine and was not that much worse than 1st (no A/C, but we had the windows open). Overall we spent two nearly entire days travelling a few hundred kilometers and back again.</li>
  <li>The surrounds of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatton,_Sri_Lanka">Hatton</a> are pretty (not so much the town itself), but there is not much else. The main site seems to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%27s_Peak">Adam’s Peak</a> a sacred site at the top of a mountain and the destination for a lot of internal tourism. It is extremely busy!</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negombo">Negombo</a> has a strip along the beach full of bars, restaurants, hotels, and shops of local arts. It seemed pleasant but definitely tourist focused. We had a very good fish meal there in a restaurant just off the strip on our last night.</li>
  <li>It was hard to find good flights to Sri Lanka. Avoiding budget airlines and overly long flights meant we had two options. Both arrived and departed near midnight. Relatively cheap though.</li>

    <p>I regularly find interesting webpages that I want to record for later viewing. Over time I fill in browser bookmarks or text documents full of them.  They tend to become lost with changes in computer or other problems. Most recently with a harddrive crash a few months ago (no important data was lost, but transient files like these bookmarks were unrecoverable). So I have decided to follow the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">advice from here</a> to create a link blog, or at least the occasional post of links. Hopefully they will sick around a bit longer that way.  I’ll try to group links based on themes (gamedev, technical, finance, …) to allow for easier search later. Also, I will not post any paywalled links, replacing them with archive links if possible.</p>

<p>So to start, here are some sci-fi and history links…</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Nemorensis">Rex Nemorensis</a> (Wikipedia) - In the early Roman Empire there was a priest at a small glade near Rome. To gain this position a slave had to escape, make their way to the glade, break a branch from a sacred tree, and then engage the current priest in a fight to the death. Wild.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.thebyzantinelegacy.com/">The Byzantine Legacy</a> - maps/pictures/diagrams of Byzantine sites.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tenochtitlan.thomaskole.nl/">A Portrait of Tenochtitlan</a> - artistic reconstructions of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, at the time of European contact, based on current research. I enjoy looking at maps of old cities trying to imagine what they were like, and this is a step up from that. See also the paintings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaletto">Canaletto</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/03/flooded-quarry-mysterious-millionaire-and-dream-new-atlantis-welsh-border-deep">A flooded quarry, a mysterious millionaire and the dream of a new Atlantis</a> (The Guardian) - I always find it surprising there isn’t more of this sort of thing compared to people trying to live on Mars. The bottom of the ocean is far more habitable than anywhere outside Earth (better water supply, better radiation protection, closer proximity to support, better gravity, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-sci-fi-movies-science-fiction-film-1201817994/">The 65 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 21st Century</a> - Yes, it’s linkbait, but it’s a good list. I’ve seen the vast majority of the films, and most of the rest I know about and don’t want to see, but still a couple went on my watch list. It has some good uncommon films (like Endless). While they definitely deserve to be somewhere on the list, I wouldn’t put Nope, Under The Skin, and The Host in the top 10 (perhaps replacing them with Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival - although that would make it Villeneuve heavy).</li>
  <li><a href="https://archive.is/iifrP">Angry workers use AI to bombard businesses with employment lawsuits</a> (archive link to bypass the Telegraph paywall) - Following on from the sci-fi above, a while ago I read Accelerando, an interesting Charlie Stross book where AGI evolves from legal and accounting computer systems. This colours the way they act, so the singularity plays out with highspeed legal warfare. This article reminded me of that.</li>

  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="/blog/2024/01/goals.html">Last year’s goals</a> were a little unambitious (apart from the Ci2D one), so I mostly did ok…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return to a decent level of fitness and strength</strong>: Technically I think I achieved this goal. I am fitter and stronger than this time last year, but barely. It turned out my shoulder was not as healed as I believed at the start of 2024, and it quickly came to limit my ability to exercise at anything other than a maintenance level. And that is where I stayed all year.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve Spanish</strong>: I have kept this up all year, just doing a little bit nearly every day, and I have improved. I’m definitely not fluent, but getting slowly better.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to 3D print (and then paint the result)</strong>: I have printed so much stuff and now have a large grey pile of shame. I know what I’m doing with the printer, and can do supports and simple maintenance without issue. Next up: learn to design my own models.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>: 15 posts. Failed the easiest goal! Mostly because gamedev work stalled out, so I didn’t have many JarrahTech posts. I have discovered I don’t feel particularly disappointed about not making this goal, which is a good sign it shouldn’t be one in future.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo quality Ci2D</strong>: I got distracted at the start of year by a webapp idea and taught myself Javascript to write it. The other 9 months I was just lazy.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year’s goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return to a decent level of fitness and strength</strong>: Same as last year. Once again I think my shoulder is improving, so time to try testing it a little (when the temperature drops in my outdoor gym). <em>Fingers crossed</em></li>
  <li><strong>Improve Spanish</strong>: If I continue with a few minutes each day, I won’t get worse. I’ve managed that for over a year now. With a occasionally little bit more and continuing the grammar drills I’ve started doing in the last few weeks, I should continue to improve.</li>
  <li><strong>Start Ci2D</strong>: Just starting would be good, it has been too long!</li>
  <li><strong>Modelling for 3D printing</strong>: Being able to print is nice, but the real benefits will come if I can model my own designs and then print them. Just need to relearn Blender and give it a go.</li>
  <li><strong>Read books</strong>: In December I started reading books again (borrowed from the local library). I started with the entertaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries">Murderbot</a> series (one left). There are so many more interesting books from the list I compiled over the last few years available at the library. I should read some. I’ll set a target of 12, one per month.</li>
