    <p>At the end of last month I was in Kuala Lumpur for a wedding. As I lived in <a href="/blog/tag/Malaysia.html">Malaysia</a> for nearly 5 years back before the pandemic, I greatly enjoyed just walking around and eating for a few days. Restoran Kin Kin still has great noodles; Pelitas is a good as ever; and, I remain unconvinced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durian">durian</a>. There are a lot more towers in the city now, including a couple of very tall ones, higher than the Petronas towers. Although it’s good to see the KL penchant for skybridges is unchanged. Kampung Baru is being slowly surrounded by high apartment complexes. The old UK High Commission (<a href="/blog/2014/03/compound-living.html">where I lived for a year</a>) is now another set of 3 massive towers, over 60 floors by my count and getting bigger! However, Ampang Mall (where I used to eat an excellent Nasi Lemak) is now a skate park, so not everything is getting taller.</p>

<p>After the wedding I went to Sabah and hiked up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kinabalu">Mount Kinabalu</a>. It is an elevation gain of roughly 2200m over 2 days to a final altitude of 4095m, the highest I’ve ever been. Luckily no altitude sickness for me this time (unlike <a href="/blog/2010/11/peru-photos.html">the Inca Trail</a>), but we were climbing at the slow “unfit” rate. The hike was well organised and not too uncomfortable compared to others I’ve done. Unfortunately for three quarters of the hike we could only see the trees around us due to the mist and rain (very common according to the guide). Only once we passed the treeline (and above the clouds) did the amazing views emerge.</p>

<p>Some photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/malaysia_24.html">available here</a>.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Soon after starting this blog I wrote posts on <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-of-which-i-am-not-a.html">companies of which I have been a paying customer, but will never be a customer again</a> and separately <a href="/blog/2009/04/companies-i-love.html">companies I love</a>. The first post was much longer than the second. I’ve been meaning to write an update on those for some time, but never got around to it. Now it is time. As always no links to bad companies, they don’t deserve the slightest referral. Also, I’ve probably forgotten a bunch in the intervening years.</p>

<p><strong>More companies of which I have been a paying customer, but will never be a customer again</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Tango - They sell gift cards, supposedly.</li>
  <li>Thomasz Developments - Real estate developers.</li>
  <li>NYT Real Estate - is there a good real estate company? I’ve never found one.</li>
  <li>McDonalds - This one has been on my naughty list since 1999, I just forgot last time.</li>
  <li>Maylands Physio</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Companies which I will try avoid</strong></p>

<p>I am still customers of these companies (although pay them no money), but I wish I wasn’t, and am slowly working to remove them from my life.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dropbox</li>
  <li>HSBC - I have one account left with First Direct in the UK, it is still useful, but I’m looking at possible alternatives.</li>
  <li>Microsoft - Only their size and ubiquity save this repeat offender. I am off Windows again (and back to Linux), hopefully that can continue.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Companies no longer loved</strong></p>

<p>Neither of the previously loved companies get to maintain that level. No company has shown especially good customer service to me in recent years, so no company gets any sense of loyalty from me.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amazon - Continually getting worse. I’d still buy from them, but definitely don’t consider their customer service to be nearly as good as before.</li>
  <li>First direct - Part of HSBC, see above.</li>
</ul>

  <h4><a href="/blog/2024/03/media.html">Media Bias</a></h4> 
  Tags: 
    
      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/General.html">General</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I often hear a complaint that the news from newspaper X or channel Y is biased. Yes of course, but does it matter? Often the same person will follow up with, “so I get my news from outlet Z”, which is some other obviously biased news source. Probably all news media is biased, I imagine it would be near impossible to be unbiased. If you find yourself agreeing with a source all the time, most likely their bias matches yours, not that they are especially accurate.</p>

<p>So if they are all biased, should you just abandon all of them? No, I don’t think that is necessary.</p>

<p>I liken handling bias in news to managing process improvement. It is not about being perfect every time, but about being able to adjust for errors. For example in aiming, you might not expect to hit the center of the target, but there is a process for adjusting technique for improving accuracy. For news or the media, I find equivalent techniques apply.</p>

<p>Imagine you are shooting for the dead center of a target. You miss, people always miss. In the Olympics people don’t get perfect scores in the shooting or archery. The distance and direction to the center is the error (and in this metaphor also the bias). If your attempts are always a little to the left that’s good, you just aim a bit to the right and you should be closer to the result. You want your shots to be in a tight cluster, then adjust your aim so the cluster is where you want it. The same with news.</p>

<p>To that end, you need 3 things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The bias to be known - if you are reading about an event you know nothing about in an unfamiliar source, unless the bias is obvious in the text (see point 2) it will be hard to work out what is really going on. Sadly this is very common and you just need to be dubious. In the aiming metaphor, you need to be able to see where your attempt lands. If you never look at the result, then you won’t know how to adjust.</li>
  <li>The bias to not be too extreme - This is often seen in more ideological publications, the result can be intentially misleading and thus very had to adjust for. This publications should just be avoided. While very common it is usually easy to spot. This is like if your shot misses by so much it doesn’t even reach the target.  All UK tabloids I’ve ever read fail on this test.</li>
  <li>The bias to be constant - If the bias keeps changing, your previous adjustments may make things worse. The tighter they are clustered the easier to adjust. If one if off to the left and the next if off to the right, what do you do? News companies controlled by one person exerting some editorial control will often exhibit this, the bias changing to whatever is convienent at the time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Something to avoid are all opinion/editorial pieces. These are mostly written specificially to influence by people not experts on the topic at hand (like this blog post :). Also most culture sections are not that great, same with sports, but neither matter much to me. Definitely keep clear of anything owned and led by billionaires. In my experience they tend to espouse their owner’s interests, which change quickly and easily (so fail #3). I remember one paper decades ago that was fiercely pro-China when the owner had business interests there, but switched hard to anti-China views when those investments failed.</p>

<p>So what do I read? I find the new sections of the specialist finanical media good (FT, AFR, Economist, Reuters, Bloomberg). Because they are unbiased? Absolutely not, they are very biased. However, when it comes to news events they pass the 3 tests above. The bias is obvious: companies, free market, being rich and capitalism are good, anything working against those things is bad. That bias not secretive either. I remember the Economist (back when I read it regularly 20 years ago) explicitly stating their neoliberal bias as an aside every few issues. Nor is it generally extreme as they have an unspoken interest in being roughly accurate. The implicit assumption is that people will make investment decisions based on the news in these outlets, so expect them to be mostly correct, and if not they would lose reputation (a self-declared Marxist first made this argument to me).</p>

<p>I have lived in a few countries and found the government media generally pass the 3 tests too. For instance, I watched the BBC in the UK and SBS in Australia. Both biased, but being inside the country at the time, I was quite aware of the size and direction of that bias. If you are not in country it would be much harder to tell. I can easily imagine that the government media in some countries may fail point #2 if they are more propagandistic and less free. I also used to read the Guardian when in the UK, being well aware of its biases, as they had been the same for decades (a sort of polite, socially acceptable left-leaning).</p>

    <p>I continued tracking the boardgames I played through 2023 (<a href="/blog/2023/02/boardgames.html">see the 2022 list</a>). Last year I played 21 different games a total of 47 times. The increase was largely due to joining a couple of clubs: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/guild/view/4251">Strategy Boardgamers WA</a> is a reborn version of the Perth Long Boardgames club that shutdown during the Covid lockdowns; The Salvage League (no website) is devoted to playing quick games of Battletech: Alpha Strike. I had a goal of finishing the year having played all my previous unplayed games (they are marked in bold). I missed one, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163154/falling-sky-gallic-revolt-against-caesar">Falling Sky</a>, but it is on the schedule to be played at SBWA in a few months (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>Games listed in <em>italics</em> are games I do not own, while those in <strong>bold</strong> are my games that I played for the first time in 2023. Very long games split over multiple days are counted in distinct play sessions (of at least 2 hours).</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts on any game I played more than once, and haven’t previously reviewed (consider my plays of 7 Wonders Duel &amp; Sprawlopolis as a sign of my continued enjoyment):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Battletech</strong>: Large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha">mecha</a> battling other large mecha in a 31st century beset by war. This miniatures wargame came out 40 years ago and has been moderately popular ever since. I like it, and have played a lot of the faster paced, larger scale Alpha Strike version, but the more detailed, slower classic version is good too.</li>
  <li><strong>Wingspan</strong>: Cute tableau builder about collecting birds for a sanctuary. Beautiful art and strangely popular with people who don’t play many boardgames. Enjoyable but I’m not  good player as a there is enough randomness that plans go astray quickly. Maybe that is why people like playing against me.</li>
  <li><strong>Villagers</strong>: Fast tableau builder about building up a medieval village by tempting increasingly skilled and thus valuable workpeople to move in.</li>
  <li><strong>High Frontier</strong>: Complicated simulation of spaceship travel and construction through the solar system. Designed by an ex-NASA engineer with known physics (no faster-than-light stuff here). Requires commitment, concentration, patience and several hours to play. Finishing a game successfully gives a sense of satisfaction, like an exhausting workout. Very hard to get other people interested in trying it, a certain mindset is required :)</li>
  <li><strong>7th Continent</strong>: A long card-based cooperative narrative adventure game that is like a cross between a choose-your-own-adventure and a boardgame. Very long - my first game was 5 hours and the second 6, both were losses. Interesting, but it seems very puzzle based, so the more you play, the more you recognise situations and the easier it becomes. I feel this may not be a keeper and after a few more games it will be time to move it on.</li>
  <li><strong>Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonics</strong>: A cross between a boardgame and a miniatures game, here you move blocks denoting various units around a board to recreate various Napoleonic battles. The hook is that you can’t just move and fight at will. To model the problems of historical command, each player must play cards that dictate which units may act. Frustrating, but in a good way, and fast playing, so it doesn’t feel unfair.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My attempt to achieve <a href="/blog/2023/02/goals.html">last years goals</a> was a failure. Not completely, I did manage to complete the two easiest and one other goal, but that is only a 50% success rate. It has been a year of distractions: from self-inflicted injury, long holidays, and technology indecision. Here is the assessment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase strength and aerobic fitness</strong>: Fail. This was going well until I tore my supraspinatus shoulder tendon in May. The physio recommended no exercise (other than light recovery exercise) for several months, but I’ve gone longer due to other things, and haven’t started again yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo quality Ci2D</strong>: Nope, nowhere near this. I started working on it four times in different languages/engines this year (Unity, Scala, Typescript and Godot). I don’t want to use Unity anymore after their <a href="https://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2023/10/01/Smug-Mode.html">fiasco</a>, but I’m struggling to find a suitable replacement.</li>
  <li><strong>Continue on IPO &amp; maybe one other</strong>: Done, but barely. I created another version of IPO, and nothing else.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>: Done. Eight here and 12 on Jarrah Technology, this is the easiest goal.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix the bedroom window issues, fix the terrace drainage problem &amp; build a chicken coop</strong>: Done, and not too badly. See the photo below of the chicken coop I built.</li>
  <li><strong>Paint at least 10 miniatures, and have played all my boardgames</strong>: So close, but no. After <a href="/blog/2023/06/miniatures.html">a late start</a>, I now have two dozen painted minis and I’m getting better. However, I have one unplayed boardgame: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163154/falling-sky-gallic-revolt-against-caesar">Falling Sky</a>, a heavy and long wargame about Caesar’s Gallic Wars (perhaps a hard sell for other players:). Still I have found a group willing to play but scheduling issues mean it is down for April.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/chicken_coop.png" alt="Chicken Coop" title="Chicken Coop" /></p>

<p>Will next year be better?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return to a decent level of fitness and strength</strong>: Just in the last month my shoulder is feeling good again. Time to (gently) get back to exercise.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve Spanish</strong>: With my extra time, I restarted learning Spanish last year. It came back fairly quickly. I should keep it up.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to 3D print (and then paint the result)</strong>: I bought myself a 3D printer for christmas. I should learn to use it properly, print some minis, and paint them.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>:  An easy one to ensure I hit at least one of these.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo quality Ci2D</strong>: This is ambitious, but I need to choose a technology and start moving.</li>
</ul>
