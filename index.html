    <p>I continued tracking the boardgames I played through 2023 (<a href="/blog/2023/02/boardgames.html">see the 2022 list</a>). Last year I played 21 different games a total of 47 times. The increase was largely due to joining a couple of clubs: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/guild/view/4251">Strategy Boardgamers WA</a> is a reborn version of the Perth Long Boardgames club that shutdown during the Covid lockdowns; The Salvage League (no website) is devoted to playing quick games of Battletech: Alpha Strike. I had a goal of finishing the year having played all my previous unplayed games (they are marked in bold). I missed one, <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163154/falling-sky-gallic-revolt-against-caesar">Falling Sky</a>, but it is on the schedule to be played at SBWA in a few months (fingers crossed).</p>

<p>Games listed in <em>italics</em> are games I do not own, while those in <strong>bold</strong> are my games that I played for the first time in 2023. Very long games split over multiple days are counted in distinct play sessions (of at least 2 hours).</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts on any game I played more than once, and haven’t previously reviewed (consider my plays of 7 Wonders Duel &amp; Sprawlopolis as a sign of my continued enjoyment):</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Battletech</strong>: Large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecha">mecha</a> battling other large mecha in a 31st century beset by war. This miniatures wargame came out 40 years ago and has been moderately popular ever since. I like it, and have played a lot of the faster paced, larger scale Alpha Strike version, but the more detailed, slower classic version is good too.</li>
  <li><strong>Wingspan</strong>: Cute tableau builder about collecting birds for a sanctuary. Beautiful art and strangely popular with people who don’t play many boardgames. Enjoyable but I’m not  good player as a there is enough randomness that plans go astray quickly. Maybe that is why people like playing against me.</li>
  <li><strong>Villagers</strong>: Fast tableau builder about building up a medieval village by tempting increasingly skilled and thus valuable workpeople to move in.</li>
  <li><strong>High Frontier</strong>: Complicated simulation of spaceship travel and construction through the solar system. Designed by an ex-NASA engineer with known physics (no faster-than-light stuff here). Requires commitment, concentration, patience and several hours to play. Finishing a game successfully gives a sense of satisfaction, like an exhausting workout. Very hard to get other people interested in trying it, a certain mindset is required :)</li>
  <li><strong>7th Continent</strong>: A long card-based cooperative narrative adventure game that is like a cross between a choose-your-own-adventure and a boardgame. Very long - my first game was 5 hours and the second 6, both were losses. Interesting, but it seems very puzzle based, so the more you play, the more you recognise situations and the easier it becomes. I feel this may not be a keeper and after a few more games it will be time to move it on.</li>
  <li><strong>Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonics</strong>: A cross between a boardgame and a miniatures game, here you move blocks denoting various units around a board to recreate various Napoleonic battles. The hook is that you can’t just move and fight at will. To model the problems of historical command, each player must play cards that dictate which units may act. Frustrating, but in a good way, and fast playing, so it doesn’t feel unfair.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>My attempt to achieve <a href="/blog/2023/02/goals.html">last years goals</a> was a failure. Not completely, I did manage to complete the two easiest and one other goal, but that is only a 50% success rate. It has been a year of distractions: from self-inflicted injury, long holidays, and technology indecision. Here is the assessment:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Increase strength and aerobic fitness</strong>: Fail. This was going well until I tore my supraspinatus shoulder tendon in May. The physio recommended no exercise (other than light recovery exercise) for several months, but I’ve gone longer due to other things, and haven’t started again yet.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo quality Ci2D</strong>: Nope, nowhere near this. I started working on it four times in different languages/engines this year (Unity, Scala, Typescript and Godot). I don’t want to use Unity anymore after their <a href="https://www.jarrahtechnology.com/2023/10/01/Smug-Mode.html">fiasco</a>, but I’m struggling to find a suitable replacement.</li>
  <li><strong>Continue on IPO &amp; maybe one other</strong>: Done, but barely. I created another version of IPO, and nothing else.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>: Done. Eight here and 12 on Jarrah Technology, this is the easiest goal.</li>
  <li><strong>Fix the bedroom window issues, fix the terrace drainage problem &amp; build a chicken coop</strong>: Done, and not too badly. See the photo below of the chicken coop I built.</li>
  <li><strong>Paint at least 10 miniatures, and have played all my boardgames</strong>: So close, but no. After <a href="/blog/2023/06/miniatures.html">a late start</a>, I now have two dozen painted minis and I’m getting better. However, I have one unplayed boardgame: <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163154/falling-sky-gallic-revolt-against-caesar">Falling Sky</a>, a heavy and long wargame about Caesar’s Gallic Wars (perhaps a hard sell for other players:). Still I have found a group willing to play but scheduling issues mean it is down for April.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/chicken_coop.png" alt="Chicken Coop" title="Chicken Coop" /></p>

<p>Will next year be better?</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return to a decent level of fitness and strength</strong>: Just in the last month my shoulder is feeling good again. Time to (gently) get back to exercise.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve Spanish</strong>: With my extra time, I restarted learning Spanish last year. It came back fairly quickly. I should keep it up.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to 3D print (and then paint the result)</strong>: I bought myself a 3D printer for christmas. I should learn to use it properly, print some minis, and paint them.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>:  An easy one to ensure I hit at least one of these.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo quality Ci2D</strong>: This is ambitious, but I need to choose a technology and start moving.</li>

      <a class="post" href="/blog/tag/China.html">China</a>
    
  <br/><br/>
  <div class="content">
    <p>I recently spent nearly a month in China. A fortnight in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangxi">Guangxi</a> (mostly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hechi">Hechi</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guilin">Guilin</a>) staying with a friend’s family, and then a few days each in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan">Wuhan</a> (halfway between Guilin and Beijing on the train), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing">Beijing</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai">Shanghai</a>. I took hundreds of photos and could write a great deal, but will try to keep it succinct with some notes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The first day was spent in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanning">Nanning</a> and I quickly noticed that the streets were quieter than expected. Almost all of the scooters on the road and about a fifth of the cars were electric so made little noise. It was easy to tell which cars were electric as they had green number plates while ICE cars had other colours. There were a wide range of electric car brands, most were local and I had never heard about them before. Tesla’s were common too. In Shanghai around half the cars seemed to be electric, but in Beijing and Wuhan it was around 10-20%.</li>
  <li>There are lots of building sites, usually of huge towers but most showed no evidence of currently being worked on (that I could see). Of course I may have missed some signs or they just weren’t being worked on at the time I passed. Still it was noticable.</li>
  <li>Travelling across the country we saw many wide navigatable rivers. Also everywhere was green and verdant. Farms seemed small (compared to Australian standards). A big one would be a few acres or more. Every bit of spare space was turned to cultivation: empty city blocks and roadside verges often had neat rows of fruit/vegetable plants.</li>
  <li>All the cities were clean (like Perth) and felt safe no matter what alley we walked down. Some of the villages were a little rougher (not much!) but that is to be expected in working agricultural centers. The vast majority of people we met (including security) were polite and friendly.</li>
  <li>High-speed trains are awesome. Quick to get on at the station, and a few hours later you are at the center of another city. They have a speed display between cabins and the highest I saw was 359km/h. Most train stations are monumental - so big they look half empty even with thousands of people in them (<a href="/slideshows/china_23.html">see photo slideshow</a>).</li>
  <li>Once we left Hechi there was air pollution everywhere. Not too bad, I’ve seen far worse, but it was still noticable. The horizon looked grey and distant buildings would fade into it. I would sneeze or cough for a few minutes each morning when leaving the hotel.</li>
  <li>Everything is done electronically. WeChat or Alipay is an absolute necesity. Train tickets, tourist site tickets, communicating with people, nearly everything we did was organised through WeChat. This worked fine until we reached Shanghai and found Alipay (which we didn’t have) was more popular, so we had problems getting things done (the ferry told us to go away).</li>
  <li>All payment is electronic through WeChat or Alipay. In my entire time in China I didn’t see a single credit card (nor use one), nor a paper ticket and I saw cash twice: once a tourist at a tourist site and once a local paying at a market. Everything else either has you send money directly through an app or has a QR code for transfers. Street stalls, hotels, trains, taxis, even the binoculars at tourist sites have QR codes. Usually this is the only way to pay. The country runs on QR codes.</li>
  <li>It must be impossible to survive as an independent tourist in China without access to these apps. We had one person with WeChat (through a local relative) and used that. As non-residents it requires some planning to get them. I applied for restricted WeChat (payment, messaging and a few other things) and it took 15 days to get access. So for the first half of the trip I was completely reliant on other people.</li>
  <li>Also you don’t have to go far off the tourist trail before having great difficulty with English. Unless you have access to WeChat/Alipay and someone who speaks Mandarin I would recommend using tour groups.</li>
  <li>Everyone has a fancy phone and spends most of their time staring at it (just like home :) Tiktok is incredibly popular, people would talk about it all the time. Public phone chargers are common and often unattended (you pay via QR code).</li>
  <li>Highspeed wifi or 5G is nearly ubiquitous, much better than in Australia. However, the Great Firewall is real and works all too well. If you want to access a website or service from outside China then bring a good VPN with you - no recommendations because the list of working ones changes every few months as the firewall is constantly updated.</li>
  <li>In the south at least the local languages seem to be disappearing, with the younger generations using Mandarin, while the middle aged and older would still use their regional language as default.</li>
  <li>China is a nation of shopkeepers. So many shops or stalls everywhere. I also saw lots of delivery drivers with stacks of packages, so Internet shopping is clearly big business too. Who is buying all the stuff? I hope the rent on shops is cheap to keep overheads low.</li>
  <li>Water fountains sometimes had 3 settings: cold, tepid, and boiling hot. That is not an exaggeration! It was boiling water that people used for pot noodles.</li>
  <li>We visited a couple of villages and the houses looked recent and decent, but they seemed empty. I am told people would move to the cities and then build a nice house back in the village but not live there (or only for short periods). The village’s permanent residents were mainly older or poorer people.</li>
  <li>A goat costs AU$400. I know because that is what we paid to provide one for a village feast. There were also ducks, chickens and geese just wandering around the village, but apparently people know who owns them. Ducks get carried around in little pastic bags with their heads poking out. Its cute, but they are often being carried to become dinner. The meat was definitely full of flavour, but also chewy. The tofu was noticable tastier than in Australia (but then our hosts were tofu makers by profession). All of the village alcohol is home made, carried around in very large bowls and quite strong. It was some kind of grain spirit (but I was told it was not rice). Alcoholism was an issue.</li>
  <li>The ground floor of village houses were an extension of the outside. Some used it for equipment storage, or animals. A couple of places used it to store silkworms on a bed of mulberry leaves (<a href="/slideshows/china_23.html">see photo slideshow</a>). A good way to earn extra money I’m told.</li>
  <li>Every house/apartment we visited had a large flatscreen TV and water filtration system. Some in the villages (but not the city) had scary exposed wiring that I told was usually done by the owner - the week before we arrived a friend of our hosts was electrocuted to death.</li>
  <li>I often saw men smoke (like Australia over 30 years ago), but never saw a woman smoking. Men seemed to be drinking far more often too. Alcohol and cigarettes are cheap, presumably the tax on them is lower?</li>
  <li>Cities got more expensive as we travelled: Hechi &lt; Guilin &lt; Wuhan &lt; Beijing &lt; Shanghai. Shanghai didn’t feel much cheaper than smaller Australian cities (apart from the alcohol and street food). Also people became clearly taller once we left Guangxi.</li>
  <li>After Hechi, we booked hotels through WeChat, but many had a no foreigners policy. All the hotels we stayed in were good, quiet and clean.</li>
  <li>Once we got to Beijing there was definite increase in police/military security. Before and after that city it was around but didn’t feel too much (we had our ID checked twice at all the train stations for example - but it was far quicker than at an airport). In Beijing we would be stoppped and have our ID and bags checked several times per day just walking around, plus extra at any tourist sites. It was always polite, fast and friendly (apart from Tianamen Square, where they gruffly checked every item in my bag individually and I had to wait for them to read each page of paper I was carrying). There were also many uniformed police or military standing, walking or marching around. Also lots more video cameras (about to London levels).</li>
  <li>Sometimes it seemed these checks were security theatre. Once I took a step too far and could see the screen of the guy checking my passport. I saw him enter an incorrect last digit of my passport number and then saw a big red warning message appear. He simply returned my passport and waved me through with a smile.</li>
  <li>We went to visit a street market and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutong">Hutong</a> (local alleyways) one of us used to frequent when they lived in Beijing for a few months 20 years ago. They no longer existed. They had been replaced by modern shops and apartments. Apparently a common occurrence. We did find a Hutong, but it felt very touristy.</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbidden_City">Forbidden City</a> is huge and a great place to visit. We spent half a day there and could easily have spent longer. Recommended.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Wall_of_China">The Great Wall</a> is overrated as a tourist site. The wall is impressive because of its extent, something you will not be able to appreciate on the few kilometers accessible at a time. It is also very busy and could be renamed the Great Line of China. We waited nearly 3 hours in line for a leisurely hour on the wall, shoulder to shoulder with other tourists. I have to say the lines were well organised. Full of turns and broken into stages, it never seemed like there was that many people in front of you - until you turned the corner. Each new stage of the queue was like a new stage in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">5 stages of grief</a>.</li>
  <li>In Guangxi apartments tended to have security grates over the windows. At the time I was told this was normal all over the country, but I rarely saw it anywhere else we went. Strange. I was also told that Guangxi had great water and it could be found bottled throughout the country, this was definitely true in my experience.</li>
  <li>Guilin is a tourist trap, everywhere we went the exit was through a gift shop or three. It is a pretty place, but I didn’t find it much prettier than areas around Hechi. I probably would have been more impressed if went there first.</li>
  <li>Many tourist sites sell icecreams in the shape of the tourist site. Reader, I succumbed to the herd instinct and bought one. They are better then I expected - not great, but decent.</li>
  <li>In Guangxi there many shops selling scooter batteries with a poster of a benevolent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donnie_Yen">Donnie Yen</a> gazing down upon the street. He was the only person on street advertising that I recognized. It was strangely comforting.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Through the purchase of various bordgames I have acquired a large number of small miniatures. Most of them are just the monochrome plastic. I thought it might be nice to try painting them. However, I didn’t want to start by wrecking the minis of any of my current games, so I bought a learn to paint kit (from Reaper Miniatures) which came with a few test minis.</p>

<p>Behold the result of my labours:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts/minis/minis1.png" width="640" alt="First Attempt" /></p>

<p>Not great, but not awful. They are each about 5 centimeters in height and at a tabletop viewing distance look “ok”. Of course if you get close or look at closeup photos, all you can see are the errors. So what did I learn apart from my eyesight is getting worse and my hands are unsteady?</p>

<ul>
  <li>The less paint per layer the better. It is easier to fix up a watered down bad stroke with another stroke/layer, rather than being stuck with too much paint hiding details or just in the wrong place.</li>
  <li>Take regular breaks.</li>
  <li>Have a “mistake” brush handy. If paint goes where it shouldn’t, promptly brushing it with water will usually fix it up.</li>
  <li>They took about 3 hours each (one at a time), so try doing a few at once. Hopefully I’ll speed up.</li>
</ul>

<p>I think it is worth continuing. Next up I’m going to try some duplicate BattleTech miniatures.</p>

    <p>It has been a while since I last travelled out of Perth, so it was nice to get away to Adelaide and its surrounds for a week.</p>

<p>Some thoughts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adelaide seems like a very quiet city, it reminds of Perth in that regard. However, where Perth is all about the beach or river, for Adelaide it is all about wineries. Must be a nice place to live.</li>
  <li>The Adelaide city markets are definitely worth a visit - should be more places like this in Australia.</li>
  <li>The little laneways around the edges of either end of Rundle St (not the mall) have some great alfresco dining.</li>
  <li>The center of Adelaide is very well laid out and pleasant to be around. It is encircled by a park which is excellent planning (reminded me of the half-encircling Turia Gardens in Valencia).</li>
  <li>The last winery in a winery tour should pay the tour organisers. Anecdotally, the last place on the tour makes the most sales since everyone is a little drunk.</li>
  <li>Going to wineries gets a bit repetitive - how many ways are there to say “this is a nice wine”?</li>
  <li>There is not much to see at the mouth of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River">Murray River</a> (Australia’s longest river), but the drive down there has some interesting sights (and of course, wineries).</li>
  <li>Still using my iPhone for photos, maybe time to dump the old camera?</li>
  <li>A week is more than enough to “see” Adelaide.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some photos from the trip are in a short slideshow <a href="/slideshows/adelaide_23.html">available here</a>.</p>
