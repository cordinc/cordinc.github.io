  <div class="content">
    <p>I regularly find interesting webpages that I want to record for later viewing. Over time I fill in browser bookmarks or text documents full of them.  They tend to become lost with changes in computer or other problems. Most recently with a harddrive crash a few months ago (no important data was lost, but transient files like these bookmarks were unrecoverable). So I have decided to follow the <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2024/Dec/22/link-blog/">advice from here</a> to create a link blog, or at least the occasional post of links. Hopefully they will sick around a bit longer that way.  I’ll try to group links based on themes (gamedev, technical, finance, …) to allow for easier search later. Also, I will not post any paywalled links, replacing them with archive links if possible.</p>

<p>So to start, here are some sci-fi and history links…</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Nemorensis">Rex Nemorensis</a> (Wikipedia) - In the early Roman Empire there was a priest at a small glade near Rome. To gain this position a slave had to escape, make their way to the glade, break a branch from a sacred tree, and then engage the current priest in a fight to the death. Wild.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.thebyzantinelegacy.com/">The Byzantine Legacy</a> - maps/pictures/diagrams of Byzantine sites.</li>
  <li><a href="https://tenochtitlan.thomaskole.nl/">A Portrait of Tenochtitlan</a> - artistic reconstructions of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, at the time of European contact, based on current research. I enjoy looking at maps of old cities trying to imagine what they were like, and this is a step up from that. See also the paintings of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaletto">Canaletto</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/feb/03/flooded-quarry-mysterious-millionaire-and-dream-new-atlantis-welsh-border-deep">A flooded quarry, a mysterious millionaire and the dream of a new Atlantis</a> (The Guardian) - I always find it surprsing there isn’t more of this sort of thing compared to people trying to live on Mars. The bottom of the ocean is far more habitable than anywhere outside Earth (better water supply, better radiation protection, closer proximity to support, better gravity, etc).</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.indiewire.com/feature/best-sci-fi-movies-science-fiction-film-1201817994/">The 65 Best Sci-Fi Movies of the 21st Century</a> - Yes, it’s linkbait, but it’s a good list. I’ve seen the vast majority of the films, and most of the rest I know about and don’t want to see, but still a couple went on my watch list. It has some good uncommon films (like Endless). While they definitely deserve to be somewhere on the list, I wouldn’t put Nope, Under The Skin, and The Host in the top 10 (perhaps replacing them with Blade Runner 2049 and Arrival - although that would make it Villeneuve heavy).</li>
  <li><a href="https://archive.is/iifrP">Angry workers use AI to bombard businesses with employment lawsuits</a> (archive link to bypass the Telegraph paywall) - Following on from the sci-fi above, a while ago I read Accelerando, an interesting Charlie Stross book where AGI evolves from legal and accounting computer systems. This colours the way they act, so the singularity plays out with highspeed legal warfare. This article reminded me of that.</li>

  <div class="content">
    <p><a href="/blog/2024/01/goals.html">Last year’s goals</a> were a little unambitious (apart from the Ci2D one), so I mostly did ok…</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return to a decent level of fitness and strength</strong>: Technically I think I achieved this goal. I am fitter and stronger than this time last year, but barely. It turned out my shoulder was not as healed as I believed at the start of 2024, and it quickly came to limit my ability to exercise at anything other than a maintenance level. And that is where I stayed all year.</li>
  <li><strong>Improve Spanish</strong>: I have kept this up all year, just doing a little bit nearly every day, and I have improved. I’m definitely not fluent, but getting slowly better.</li>
  <li><strong>Learn to 3D print (and then paint the result)</strong>: I have printed so much stuff and now have a large grey pile of shame. I know what I’m doing with the printer, and can do supports and simple maintenance without issue. Next up: learn to design my own models.</li>
  <li><strong>18 blog articles (including Jarrah Technology)</strong>: 15 posts. Failed the easiest goal! Mostly because gamedev work stalled out, so I didn’t have many JarrahTech posts. I have discovered I don’t feel particularly disappointed about not making this goal, which is a good sign it shouldn’t be one in future.</li>
  <li><strong>Demo quality Ci2D</strong>: I got distracted at the start of year by a webapp idea and taught myself Javascript to write it. The other 9 months I was just lazy.</li>
</ul>

<p>This year’s goals:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Return to a decent level of fitness and strength</strong>: Same as last year. Once again I think my shoulder is improving, so time to try testing it a little (when the temperature drops in my outdoor gym). <em>Fingers crossed</em></li>
  <li><strong>Improve Spanish</strong>: If I contine with a few minutes each day, I won’t get worse. I’ve managed that for over a year now. With a occasionally little bit more and continuing the grammar drills I’ve started doing in the last few weeks, I should continue to improve.</li>
  <li><strong>Start Ci2D</strong>: Just starting would be good, it has been too long!</li>
  <li><strong>Modelling for 3D printing</strong>: Being able to print is nice, but the real benefits will come if I can model my own designs and then print them. Just need to relearn Blender and give it a go.</li>
  <li><strong>Read books</strong>: In December I started reading books again (borrowed from the local library). I started with the entertaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murderbot_Diaries">Murderbot</a> series (one left). There are so many more interesting books from the list I compiled over the last few years available at the library. I should read some. I’ll set a target of 12, one per month.</li>

Over 2024, I played 31 different games a total of 69 times. A high-water mark I doubt I’ll challenge this year (unless my online boardgame playing really expands). I had an attempt on the 5x5 challenge (playing 5 games 5 times each), but fell a single game short. The full list is below, with the ones I own in <em>italics</em>.</p>

<p>Most of the Battletech games were played at various local clubs. Many of the rest were played at the monthly Strategy Boardgame WA club. Although there are a few from meetups with the WA Boardgame Association and one from the local 18XX afficionados (my unofficial name) meetup. This year I also started playing online - all the games of Nevsky, 18GA and two of the Shikoku 1889 games were played online at <a href="https://www.rally-the-troops.com/">Rally the Troops</a> or <a href="https://18xx.games/">18XX.games</a>. I had previously tried playing online with Vassal and was unimpressed, but these new websites are much better. Also, after having played a few solo games I don’t think they are for me. I find myself taking advantage of the simplicity or lack of creativity of my cardboard opponent in a way that does not translate well to playing against humans. Playing online seems a better option, or playing computer games specifically designed for solo play.</p>

<p>This year I sold two games: 7th Continent (too repetitive and long) and Arkham Horror (not able to get it to the table other than solo). I acquired a bunch of games - a few I purchased, but more as gifts. Only one of these I managed to play during the year: Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients. So there is a replenished list of owned but unplayed games I need to reduce. I am considering selling a few more games as they seem hard to get people to play, so I always forget the rules in the year or two between plays: Falling Sky; High Frontier; and Twilight Struggle. However, I’m leaning towards keeping them at the moment.</p>

<p>Here are my thoughts on some games I played multiple times this year, and haven’t previously reviewed:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Nevsky</strong>: Brutal and unforgiving wargame set in during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1240_Izborsk_and_Pskov_campaign">Teutonic invasion of Novgorod in the 13th century</a>. This game requires and rewards careful planning of supply lines, equipment and an army’s length of service. Then winter comes and makes it all even harder. Also has an interesting command system so that if your plans go awry, you may have to pass a few turns until reseting. This is a clever game, that feels true to its setting, but I’m not sure it is a fun game for me. I’ll try to give it another go in a few months.</li>
  <li><strong>Commands &amp; Colors: Ancients</strong>: Fast block-based wargame set during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punic_Wars">Punic wars</a>, that has a card-based command system limiting your power to do things. A charge on the left flank may win the game, but if you don’t have a card that allows you to perform that charge then tough luck. Fun.</li>
  <li><strong>Conquest of Paradise</strong>: This is a very interesting and enjoyable game. A fast-playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4X">4X</a> set during the polynesian expansion with random island placement. There is a strong emphasis on the first two X’s: explore and expand. The 4th X, extermination, is rare - in the 3 games I played there were only 2 battles, both as the final game winning action. I saw more battles avoided through a dance-off!</li>
  <li><strong>Viticulture</strong>: Eurostyle worker placement game about the winemaking process. I played a few of these this year. This was probably the most enjoyable, but they were all quite similar and fun.</li>
  <li><strong>Falling Sky</strong>: Asymmetric wargame set in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallic_Wars">Gallic Wars</a>. Long and complicated. It requires a great deal of concentration, which I like, but is corresponding hard to get people to play.</li>
  <li><strong>Shikoku 1889</strong>: A relatively gentle introduction to the generally unforgiving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18XX">18XX</a> genre. Build railways at the start of the industrial revolution, with the aim of maximising your personal wealth (as opposed to the railway companies’ wealth). These games have some clever tabletop implementation of financial concepts (like companies, IPOs and debt). I will have to try more of these.</li>
  <li><strong>Agricola: ACGAS</strong>: 2-player worker placement game. A smaller version of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31260/agricola">Agricola</a> (which I haven’t played). Very little player interaction, as you build up a small medieval farm. Now we have played a few times it largely always plays out the same way. Fun, but perhaps a little too limited.</li>
  <li><strong>Pax Pamir</strong>: I read the rules before playing this each time, yet still after 2 games I don’t know what is happening during the game. This tableau builder set in the historical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Game">Afghani Great Game</a> seems simple, but that belies quite a bit of depth and strategy. An experienced player easily defeats a newbie. Do I want to put the effort in to be a good player? Not sure.</li>
  <li><strong>El Grande</strong>: I played this at WABA. A very interesting area control/hand management game with some special and hidden actions. After two games I hadn’t worked out a good strategy, at least not against my opponents. I like the initiative deck system where each player choses a unique starting priority (unique both across all players in a round, and across all rounds by a player) - high priority and you start first, but get few resources, or vice versa. I was less keen on the hidden units in the castille, but then I’m not a fan of memory tests. A good game, I’d definitely play again.</li>
  <li><strong>Arkham Horror</strong>: Coop cardgame which attempts to tell a Lovecraftian horror adventure story. I just played the introductory campaign that comes in the box, but many more can be bought as expansions. It is definitely grim and difficult. The game doesn’t care about your success and negative effects (and some positive) persist through the game so failure or compromise seems inevitable. Thus the theme is well captured. I like: that cards are dual use (for points or ability); the chitpull modifier system; and, that the story advances along two sequences (your story and the opponents plan). I like less that the story is fixed, so after playing it once it gets easier as you know what is happening and what to do. This is not as prominent as in 7th Continent, as each mission in Arkham is probably only played a few times and changes completely for a new mission (unlike 7th where most of the cards are the same across curses, so you do them over and over again). Replayability is enhanced by the expansions, but the cost adds up quickly. Still if my usual game group were interested then I would buy and play them, but (being keen on winning and not keen on coop) they are not interested.</li>
</ul>

    <p>Some more games I played over the last 6 months of 2024.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/758370/Through_the_Ages/">Through The Ages</a></strong> (9 hrs) - A computer version of the well regarded card-based, civilisation building boardgame <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182028/through-the-ages-a-new-story-of-civilization">of the same name</a>. Graphics are simple, presumably to match the tabletop’s physical cards. The game is reasonably complex, and it’s good to have the computer do the calculations for you. Not much else to say. It seems like a competent conversion, but I doubt people will want it unless they already have an interest in the original version.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/510420/The_Hex/">The Hex</a></strong> (1 hr) - A mashup of many genres in service of a story game with many secrets. Hard to define, it is by the same person as Pony Island (which I didn’t like) and <a href="/blog/2022/04/enough-gaming.html">Inscryption</a> (which I loved) - so if you know either of them, this is similar. It falls between those games both chronologically and in my appreciation. However, the genres and tropes it was playing with don’t interest me much, so I bounced off it hard. My advice, start with Inscryption and if you like that, move backwards through the others.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1162700/Midnight_Protocol/">Midnight Protocol</a></strong> (3 hrs) - Hacking game. Move around computer networks, run programs to break defences and steal. I’ve played a few of these and find them quite similar. This is a well made, but standard version. The marketing materials tout the keyboard only controls, but I fail to see why that is a notable feature. Good game, but felt too familiar to grab my interest.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/Vampire_Survivors/">Vampire Survivors</a></strong> (30 hrs) - A novel bullet-hell game, where the player is the bullet hell. The player doesn’t need to shoot, your weapons automatically shoot for you on a set schedule/pattern - just like the enemies in a normal bullet hell. Start underpowered, running away from the enemies, and soon find yourself over-powered, blasting projectiles in a satisfying cacophony of shapes, colour and sound. In later stages the biggest difficulty is understanding what is happening on a very busy screen! But not to worry, because games all finish after at most 30 minutes, then its time to start over. A simple game with plain graphics and sound, but the gameplay is so well designed it becomes extremely addictive. I do not normally like this sort of game, but this is a big exception. A great game!</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/632470/Disco_Elysium__The_Final_Cut/">Disco Elysium</a></strong> (2 hrs) - I really wanted to like this chatty isometric RPG with tabletop (ie dice rolling) mechanics. It is set in a strange, but vaguely 70’s world, where you are investigating a murder, while various parts of your mind converse with you. Strange, but slow. I made a bad choice and the game ended abruptly after 30 minutes, so I needed to start again. Then it crashed on me after an hour (and wiped my saves). I didn’t have the motivation to restart and go over the same thing a third time. Showed potential, but not enough to hook me.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1434540/Zoeti/">Zoeti</a></strong> (6 hours) - Fantasy cutesy anime semi-deckbuilder battler where the player collects cards for actions and then draws from a normal deck of cards and uses that to power the actions. It also has a narrative story (although not one I found particularly interesting). An interesting idea for variation on the Slay The Spire system, but is otherwise extremely similar, and not as good (of course Slay The Spire is exceptional!). This feels like a mobile conversion, and some of the UI is clunky as a result. It is an ok game.</p>

    <p>Did you know Neflix has games? I have been a subscriber for years and never played one of their games. Since I am likely to leave their site soon (for a little while at least), I thought I should try a few games before I go. All the below were played on an iPad and the time played is a guess as Netflix won’t tell me.</p>

<p><strong>Immortality</strong> (about 6-8 hours?) - I was keen to play this after greatly enjoying <a href="/blog/2015/07/her-story.html">Her Story</a>, a previous game by the same team. The player goes through the scenes of 3 films out of order to discover their mysteries. Scrub back and forth through scenes and access newly available scenes by selecting objects common to both. The problem is I didn’t know what the mystery was. I just aimlessly went through scenes. Even though a larger story did start to emerge, I never really lost that confused directionlessness. Perhaps as a result, I felt a lot more passive in this game than Her Story. I just lost interest, thinking I was a long way from the end, but reading the plot in online spoilers I had actually discovered most of the story. Interesting and well made, but too clever for its own good.</p>

<p><strong>Game Dev Tycoon</strong> (about 6-8 hours?) - Instead of actual game dev perhaps I could just play a game about game dev? This is a fairly simple and unchallenging simulation game, almost casual. You choose the genre/topic/platform of your next game and it gets reviewed and sells based on how much effort is put into various areas. Then repeat until you go broke or finish the game. If you play games semi-regularly then the appropriate actions are unsurprising, On my one and only game I got nowhere near bankruptcy. It has an indie charm, but I staring losing interest quickly, only continuing to the end to see if something changed or happened (it didn’t).</p>

<p><strong>Spiritfarer</strong> (90 minutes?) - Cosy basebuilder game where the player replaces Charon in ferrying the dead to the underworld. Only instead of a small rowboat, you have a large ship with various upgrades available (including a garden). In my time playing I didn’t ferry a single soul, instead spent my time collecting resources and talking with the local residents between life and death. Very slow and chatty, plus the controls on my iPad were awkward, so it quickly lost my attention. Not my sort of game.</p>

<p><strong>Monument Valley</strong> (1 hour?) - Good looking puzzle game. Not my thing.</p>

<p><strong>Moonlighter</strong> (4-5 hours?) - Pixel graphics, realtime roguelike where after each short run in the dungeon you take the loot back to your store and sell it for money. Or, use it to craft better equipment, but I sold most of it. You can also upgrade your home town and your store - a nice touch. Not too taxing, being defeated just delays you and it’s always possible to escape at a small cost. I found the iPad controls a bit annoying for a realtime game, the targets on the screen were too small when trying to touch them with my fat fingers. A good, almost cosy roguelike (I didn’t know that was even possible!), but started to feel repetitive.</p>

<p><strong>Exploding Kittens</strong> (1 hour?) - Card game translated directly from the popular <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/172225/exploding-kittens">tabletop version</a> (which I had not played previously). Has an evil (?) cat theme, trying to be funny. High variance, but very short and quick to replay so that is not a problem - I think the idea is you play multiple times in a session. When playing alone against the AI this was mildly entertaining, but I imagine it shines when played as a group party game.</p>

<p><strong>Terra Nil</strong> (3-4 hours) - A anti-city builder. It plays like a city builder (place and connect buildings on a map grid), but the task is to clean up a polluted site and leave it pristine after tearing down all the buildings previously built. Excellent idea, and its full of nice touches like the animals moving back in (and their happiness level according to the current environment). Again, I would describe this as cosy, is this a theme with Netflix games? Nice game.</p>
