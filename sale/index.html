<h4>RM500 COD - pickup near KLCC</h4>

<a href="cds.xls">List of CDs and CDRs</a><br/><br/>

I'm looking to sell my CD collection before leaving KL in May. There are 723 CDs + 49 CDR albums and 453 vinyl EPs copied to CDRs (see spreadsheet linked above). They are all in folders (no jewel cases) but all insets and special boxes have been kept. There is a broad range of styles but mostly 90's music tending. They all played fine last time they were played, but none have been played in the last 5 years at least. 
<br/><br/>
The collection will be sold as a whole. Individual CDs will not be sold separately.
